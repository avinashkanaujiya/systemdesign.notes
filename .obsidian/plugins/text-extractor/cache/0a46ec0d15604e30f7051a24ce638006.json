What is DNA technology? ● DNA/Deoxyribonucleic acid is the genetic materi- al of the cell and contains all of the instructions for cells to carry out their structure and function. ● DNA technology is the study and manipulation of genetic material, which includes sequencing, analy- sis, and cutting-and-pasting of DNA. ● Using this technology, scientists are able to manip- ulate DNA to study the biology of living organisms and to improve human life (treatment of diseases). ● However, the technology can be abused through un- authorised access to databanks and unauthorised disclosure of information. Background of the Bill: ● First proposed in 2003 (by the Ministry of S&T), the Bill has gone through numerous changes, led by both the Department of Biotechnology and the Law Ministry, over the years. ● In 2019, it was referred to the Parliamentary Stand- ing Committee on S&T after being introduced in the Lok Sabha. ● In 2021, the panel’s report was released, which high- lighted that the Bill could be misused to target seg- ments of society based on religion, caste or political views. About the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regula- tion Bill: ● It seeks to create a regulatory framework for ob- taining, storing and testing DNA samples of human beings - ○ Mainly for the purposes of criminal investi- gations, and ○ With the objective of establishing the iden- tity of a person. ● The proposed law seeks to bring in a supervisory structure - ○ To oversee practices (already used in crimi- nal investigations, establishment of parent- age, and search for missing people), and ○ Frame guidelines and rules so that the DNA www.insightsonindia.com3 technology is not misused. ● It also specifies - ○ The circumstances under which a person can be asked to submit DNA samples, ○ The purposes for which such requests can be made, and ○ The exact procedure for handling, storing and accessing these samples. The Bill proposes to set up institutional structures: ● At the national level, ○ DNA regulatory board: The board is pro- posed to be the main regulatory authority and would frame the rules and guidelines for DNA collection, testing and storage. ○ DNA data bank: It would be the repository of all DNA samples collected from various people under specified rules. ● Regional centres of the board as well as the data bank can be set up at the state level too. Powers of the DNA regulatory board: The testing of DNA samples can be carried out only at laboratories that are au- thorised to do so by the regulatory board. Objections against the Bill: ● Three issues - whether DNA technology is foolproof, whether the provisions adequately address the pos- sibility of abuse of DNA information, and whether the privacy of the individual is protected. ● DNA information can be extremely revelatory and collecting and storing such intrusive information could lead to abuse and violation of a person’s pri- vacy. The government’s argument: ● Nearly 60 countries have enacted similar legisla- tion and all important matters related to privacy, confidentiality and data protection have been taken into account. ● Very limited information is proposed to be stored in the indices, which can tell nothing about the indi- vidual and only act as a unique identifier. Why is Bill withdrawn? As per reports, most of the provisions of the Bill were broadly covered in the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act 2022 brought by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Insta Links: DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regula- tion Bill 2019 GS Paper 2 NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN (NCW) Syllabus: Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies con- stituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulner- able Sections Context: The cases of molestation and rape of women in Manipur have brought the functioning of Women’s commis- sions in India into focus. National Commission for Women (NCW): ● It is a statutory body of the Government of India that was founded on January 31, 1992, by the Na- tional Commission for Women Act, 1990. ● Its mandate is to: ○ Review the Constitutional and Legal safe- guards for women; ○ Recommend remedial legislative measures; ○ Facilitate redressal of grievances and ○ Advise the Government on all policy matters affecting women. ● Functions: ○ Investigate and examine all issues concern- ing the protection provided to women un- der the Constitution and other legislation. ○ Report on the effectiveness of those safe- guards to the Central Government. ○ Make recommendations in such reports for the effective application of those protec- tions. ○ Propose corrective legislative actions to ad- dress any flaws in laws. ○ Investigate complaints and take suo moto action in cases involving the denial of wom- en’s rights. www.insightsonindia.com4 The Manipur State Commission for Women (MSCW): ● Each state also has its own commission and MSCW was constituted in 2006 as a statutory body under the Manipur State Commission for Women Act, 2006. ● It is mandated to safeguard the interests of women with a wide mandate that covers all aspects of wom- en’s development. Major Issues around the Working of Women Commission: ● Financial assistance provided to the Commissions is extremely less to cater to its needs. ● Their members are appointed by the government and therefore lack the independence to work with- out the influence of the government. ● They lack concrete legislative power. For example, its reports are only recommendatory. Implications of the above: ● These commissions at the national and state levels have become toothless tigers, failing to prioritise field visits over paperwork. ● Most of the commissions are afraid to criticise the governments. Case of Manipur: ● The NCW had received a large number of com- plaints about the violation of women’s rights in the state. ● The NCW forwarded them to the state. The state police or its other wings probably ignored the for- wards or did not have time to do justice to each of them. Way ahead: ● Commissions need to be strengthened (either by giving them Constitutional status or by amending their parent laws) so that they can concentrate on providing physical, emotional, legal and psychologi- cal aid to women in distress. ● Advertising the posts of chairpersons and members of these commissions. ● Genuinely interested and capable individuals would then be selected by a selection committee - consist- ing of LoP, judges from the SC, civil society organisa- tions, etc. ● A social audit of the performance of different com- missions by competent external agencies on a reg- ular basis would give citizens an idea of their actual work. ● There is a need for an increase of awareness and enlightenment especially required mainly among women in rural areas that such a commission exists to address their rights. Conclusion: Women’s commissions in India were set up with a lot of high expectations. However, a review of their work and responses to the issues of women is the immediate need of the hour to prevent incidents like Manipur.

(UPSC 2017) GS Paper 3 ISSUES FACED BY GIG WORKERS IN INDIA Syllabus: Indian Economy and related issues Context: A parliamentary panel has asked the Ministry of La- bour and Employment (MoL&E) to formulate and implement welfare schemes for gig and platform workers and unorgan- ised sector workers at the earliest. Why? Since such workers do not come under the purview of the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, appropriate/ specific welfare schemes for them need to be put in place by the government. What is a gig economy? ● It is a labour market that relies heavily on tempo- rary and part-time positions filled by independent contractors and freelancers rather than full-time permanent employees. ● Gig workers gain flexibility and independence but little or no job security. Gig workers Gig workers refer to workers outside of the traditional em- ployer-employee relationship. There are two groups of gig workers. Platform workers Non-platform workers When gig workers use on- line algorithmic matching platforms or apps to con- nect with customers, they are called platform workers. Those who work outside of these platforms are non-platform workers, including construction workers and non-technol- ogy-based temporary work- ers. Gig economy in India: According to the NITI Aayog esti- mates, nearly 23.5 million workers will be engaged in the gig economy by 2029. www.insightsonindia.com5 Issues faced by gig workers: ● Since the gig economy falls outside the scope of tra- ditional, full-time employment, gig workers usually lack basic employment rights such as ○ Minimum wages, ○ Overtime pay, ○ Medical leave, and ○ A statutorily bound resolution of employ- er-employee disputes. ● Gig workers display characteristics of both employ- ees and independent contractors → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits under - ○ the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bonus Act 196 (for em- ployees) ○ the Contract Labour (Regulation and Aboli- tion) Act 1970 (for contract labourers) What is the proposed law for gig workers? ● The Code on Social Security 2020, which has pro- posed social security schemes for gig workers and platform workers on matters relating to - ○ life and disability cover, ○ accident insurance, ○ health and maternity benefits, ○ old age protection, etc. ● However, the Code is yet to come into force. Other efforts: A MoU has been signed between the MoL&E and the NLSIU (Bangalore) for assistance in framing a new scheme for the gig and platform workers as well as workers in the unorgan- ised sector. Concerns: ● Out of the four new labour codes proposed, gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security. ○ Hence, they cannot create legally rec- ognised unions and access a national min- imum wage that applies to all forms of em- ployment. ○ They also remain excluded from access- ing the specialised redressal mechanism against their employers. ● Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘un- organised workers’ or ‘wage workers’. ● They also do not have the right to collective bargain- ing - a fundamental principle of modern labour law. ● All the above leads to the violation of their funda- mental rights under Articles 14 and 21 and comes within the meaning of forced labour under Article 23. Best practices: ● The Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Reg- istration and Welfare) Act 2023: Rajasthan has be- come the first state in the country to pass a law for the welfare of lakhs of gig workers earning their live- lihood through online platforms (Ola, Swiggy, etc). ● Germany’s Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers. ● Singapore has also proposed legislative changes to extend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers. Conclusion: A specific scheme for such workers, as recom- mended by the Standing Committee on Labour, Textiles, and Skill Development may resolve the above concerns.

(UPSC 2016) GS Paper 3 INDIA’S ETHANOL PUSH Context: At a G20 Energy Ministers’ meeting, the Indian PM stated that India has rolled out 20% ethanol-blended petrol this year and aims to cover the entire country by 2025. Ethanol: ● Ethanol is basically 99.9% pure alcohol that can be blended with petrol. ● It is different from the 94% rectified spirit (having applications in paints, and pharmaceuticals) and 96% extra neutral alcohol that goes to make potable liquor. India’s ethanol production programme: It has come a long way in the past five years, both in terms of the quantities supplied by sugar mills/distilleries to oil marketing compa- nies (OMCs) and the raw material used. Raw material used: www.insightsonindia.com6 What does it mean? ● India’s ethanol programme is no longer reliant on a single feedstock or crop. ● It has diversified only from molasses and cane to rice, maize and other grains as well. Implications of diversification of feedstocks: ● It will minimise supply fluctuations and price vola- tility on account of any one crop. ● The incorporation of new feedstocks can create new demand for grains. ○ For example, if UP (a major sugarcane grow- er) and Bihar (maize) could supply rice, bar- ley and millets to distilleries, they can “fuel India” the way Punjab, Haryana or MP “feed India”. How was this diversification made possible? ● Differential pricing: ○ Till 2017-18, the OMCs were paying a uni- form price for ethanol produced from any feedstocks. ○ From 2018-19, the government began fix- ing higher prices for ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses and whole sugarcane juice/syrup. ○ This gave flexibility and incentive for mills/ distilleries to use multiple feedstocks. ○ This has given stimulus to ethanol produc- tion, which can be seen from its all-India av- erage blending with petrol touching 11.75% in 2022-23, as against 1.6% in 2013-14. ● Byproduct benefits: ○ The liquid effluent (spent wash) generated during alcohol production in distilleries can pose serious environmental problems if discharged without proper treatment. ○ The new molasses-based distilleries have MEE (multi-effect evaporator) units, where the spent wash is concentrated to about 60% solids. ○ The concentrated wash is used as a boiler fuel along with bagasse (the fibre remaining after crushing sugarcane). While the ethanol program has numerous benefits, there are also some concerns. Increased demand for grains for ethanol production may impact food supply and prices. Ad- ditionally, distilleries’ liquid effluent can pose environmental challenges, but advancements such as multi-effect evapora- tor units have enabled the utilization of spent wash as boil- er fuel and the production of fertilizer and animal feed as by-products. Conclusion: Overall, the ethanol program holds promise for reducing de- pendence on fossil fuels, promoting sustainable practices, and providing opportunities for farmers and industries.

How? The Strategy rests on the vision of climate-resilient agricul- ture to transform agri-food systems to be more efficient, in- clusive, resilient and sustainable. www.insightsonindia.com7 Why? Sustainable and resilient agrifood systems provide a variety of solutions that respond to climate crisis challenges and contribute to restoring degraded natural and managed eco- systems. FAO Strategy on Climate Change 2022-2031: ● Endorsed by the FAO Council, this Strategy is a re- sponse to the worldwide challenge of tackling the impacts of the climate crisis. ● It aims to address a broad range of interlinked chal- lenges, including - ○ biodiversity loss, ○ desertification, ○ land and environmental degradation, ○ the need for accessible, affordable renew- able energy, and ○ food and water security. Implications: It will help countries implement their coun- try-driven commitments and plans, including - ● Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and ● National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) ● 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Conclusion: The new Strategy looks beyond only food pro- duction by considering crops and livestock, forests, fisheries and aquaculture in a holistic manner, as well as embracing the indispensable role of women, youth and Indigenous Peo- ples, as essential agents of change.

Facts for Prelims (FFP) PM-WANI Context: The Digital India programme has three main vi- sion areas: digital connectivity, software and services on demand, and digital empowerment of citizens. To achieve this, the creation of inter-operable public Wi-Fi hotspots called PM-WANI (Wi-Fi Access Network Interface) was pro- posed to provide affordable internet access to the common people, especially in rural and underserved areas. •\t PM-WANI allows the last-mile distribution of broad- band through Public Data Offices (PDOs) offering sachet-sized packages of internet for as low as Rs 5 to 10. •\t This framework offers a business opportunity for aggregators (PDOAs) without additional licensing fees, fostering the growth of local nano-entrepre- neurs who establish Wi-Fi hotspots and offer inter- net access to other users. •\t It offers an affordable and reliable solution for un- derserved areas, benefiting ISPs and Telcos by ex- panding their customer base.

Currently, the settlement process takes one day (T+1) after the trade date, but with T+0 settlement, funds and securities will be transferred instantly on the same day as the trade. This shift will bring operational efficiency, faster fund remit- tances, and immediate availability of money and shares for investors. What is the T+1 settlement cycle? In simple terms, T+1 settlement means that securities trans- actions will reflect in the demat account after a day instead of two days now under the T+2 cycle. If an investor buys a stock on Thursday, it would be shown in the demat account on Friday. Now with T+0 settlement, investors can find the purchased on the same day (i.e., Thursday) T+2: Was introduced in 2017 T+1: Was recently allowed in the Indian stock market (Janu- ary 2023) T+0: May be introduced by the next financial year (2024) WTO: AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES SUBSIDIES Context: Trade experts and civil society members are urg- ing India not to ratify the fisheries subsidies agreement re- cently agreed upon by the World Trade Organization (WTO) members. What is the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement at WTO? The fisheries subsidies agreement agreed upon by the WTO prohibits subsidies for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and overfished stocks. It also restricts subsi- www.insightsonindia.com9 dies for fishing on the high seas, outside the jurisdiction of coastal countries and Regional Fisheries Management Orga- nizations. Transition Period: Developing countries and Least Devel- oped Countries (LDCs) are granted a two-year transition pe- riod under Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) and are not obligated to implement disciplines during this period. Exemptions: The agreement allows subsidies for vessels or operators not engaged in IUU fishing and permits subsidies to rebuild overfished stocks to a sustainable level. Advantages for India: For India, the agreement is seen as crucial to combat large- scale IUU fishing that impacts coastal communities’ liveli- hoods and depletes fisheries resources. Concerns: Concerns for India Description 1. Impact on Liveli- hoods Reduction in subsidies may nega- tively affect small-scale and tradi- tional fishers’ livelihoods and in- come. 2. Competitiveness Indian fishing industries may face challenges competing with heavily subsidized fishing operations from other nations. 3. Resource Access Restrictions on subsidies for fishing in certain areas may limit Indian fishing vessels’ access to high-seas fishing grounds, affecting their abili- ty to catch valuable fish stocks. 4. Impact on the Fishing Industry The agreement may lead to in- creased operational costs for the fishing industry, impacting its over- all competitiveness. 5. Market Disrup- tions Reduced subsidies for certain fish- ing practices may lead to market disruptions and changing dynamics in the industry. 6. Negotiation Leverage India’s bargaining power in interna- tional fishing negotiations may be affected by the new agreement’s provisions. 7. Unequal for India Concerns have been raised that the agreement is unequal and does not address the overfishing and over- capacity issues adequately India’s stand India, being a low fisheries subsidizer with a sustainable ap- proach, emphasizes that advanced fishing nations that have historically provided substantial subsidies and contributed to fish stock depletion should bear more responsibility based on the ‘polluter pay principle’ and ‘common but differenti- ated responsibilities.’ Suggestions: Experts have suggested India initiate talks for a comprehen- sive agreement that addresses industrial fishing nations’ disciplines related to overcapacity and overfishing. India has not yet ratified the agreement. FLUOROCHEMICALS Context: Researchers at the University of Oxford have achieved a groundbreaking breakthrough by developing a new technique to produce fluorochemicals without using hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas. What are Fluorochemicals and how are they produced? Fluorochemicals are essential chemical compounds used in various industries, including polymers, agrochemicals, phar- maceuticals, and lithium-ion batteries. They are known for their unique properties, including high thermal stability and resistance to chemicals. Traditionally, fluorochemicals are produced through an ener- gy-intensive process involving the use of hazardous hydro- gen fluoride (HF) gas. HF is generated by reacting a crystal- line mineral called fluorspar (CaF2) with sulfuric acid under harsh conditions. This process has safety risks and environ- mental consequences due to HF spills. What is the New Method? Inspired by the natural biomineralization process that forms teeth and bones, researchers successfully activated sol- id-state calcium fluoride (CaF2) through a mechanochemical process. This innovative method, named Fluoromix, allows for the direct synthesis of over 50 different fluorochemicals from CaF2 with impressive yields of up to 98%. Significance: The new approach has the potential to en- hance safety and environmental impact, streamline the sup- ply chain, and reduce energy demands in the rapidly expand- ing global fluorochemical industry. www.insightsonindia.com10 CELLS WITH BARE MINIMUM GENES CAN STILL EVOLVE AS FAST AS NORMAL CELLS Context: Researchers from Indiana University conducted an experiment using a synthetically designed minimal cell con- taining only essential genes for survival to understand how such a cell would evolve under evolutionary forces. •\t They used a synthetic version of Mycoplasma my- coides, a microbe commonly found in the guts of goats and cattle, creating a stripped-down minimal cell (JCVI-syn3.B) with only 493 genes. •\t Despite the minimal cell’s reduced fitness and sick- ness due to genome minimization, the researchers found that it could evolve as fast as a normal cell. The minimal cells evolved differently from non-minimal cells, and the study shed light on microbial evolution and the po- tential of synthetic organisms in synthetic biology applica- tions. The findings show that even organisms with minimal genomes can evolve and adapt effectively, providing valu- able insights into evolutionary processes. HYGROELECTRICITY Context: Researchers are exploring the concept of hygro- electricity, which involves harvesting electricity from hu- mid air. Methods of generating hygroelectricity: •\t Using tiny protein nanowires produced by bacte- ria to trap water molecules and create electrical charges, potentially providing usable electricity to power miniature computers or sensors. •\t Another method involves passing humid air be- tween two pieces of metal, inducing a charge as the moist air flows over them. Advantages: Versatility, sustainable. Disadvantages: Scale up of technology. SILVOPASTURE SYSTEMS What are Silvopasture systems? They are a sustainable land management approach that combines trees, livestock grazing, and forage production on the same land, providing ecological and economic benefits. Advantages: •\t Improved local climate resilience: Creating favour- able Microclimates •\t Can play a vital role in reversing deforestation trends caused by increased demand for pasture. •\t Silvopasture acts as a natural carbon sink, reducing carbon dioxide emissions significantly •\t It regulates local climatic conditions, buffering against temperature and wind extremes, providing a favourable environment for livestock, thus improv- ing animal welfare •\t Enhancing soil quality Significance: Transitioning to more silvopasture systems by Indian farmers can help address the threats of climate change and land degradation, offering a promising solution for resilient agricultural landscapes in the face of deteriorat- ing natural resources and forests. SCORPENE-CLASS DIESEL-ELEC- TRIC SUBMARINES Context: India is set to procure three additional Scor- pene-class diesel-electric submarines, with the contract expected to be finalized by the end of 2024 (under Indian Navy’s project 75) More about the News: •\t The first submarine delivery is likely to take place www.insightsonindia.com11 around 2031. •\t The new submarines will have higher indigenous content and will be equipped with the DRDO-devel- oped Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, en- hancing their endurance. This move aims to bolster the Indian Navy’s submarine fleet, which currently consists of 16 conventional subma- rines and is expected to deplete over the next decade due to ageing vessels. Project-75 The Indian Navy’s Project 75 involves the construction of six Scorpene-Class attack submarines. These convention- al-powered submarines, weighing 1,500 tonnes and capa- ble of diving up to 300 meters, are being manufactured by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) (Mumbai) with technology support from France’s Naval Group. •\t The first submarine in the series, INS Kalvari, was com- missioned in 2017 •\t Second submarine INS Khanderi in 2019 •\t The third one is INS Karanj in 2021 •\t The fourth one is INS Vela in 2021 •\t Fifth one, INS Vagir, in January 2023 •\t A sixth submarine, Vagsheer, is undergoing trial phases and is expected to be delivered to the Navy in early 2024.
