Some argue that India should prioritize uplifting its people above the poverty line and improving governance before venturing into global pow- er politics. However, the article emphasizes that India’s rise as a great power will have global consequences and should not be ignored. Options available before India: ● To become a great power asserting its growing pow- er internationally to address global issues, or ● To focus on its people - eliminating poverty, improv- ing governance, etc. - before venturing into making a better world. Tracking India’s journey: ● India of 1991: ○ A weak, poor country with a foreign ex- change reserve of $5.8 billion and a nominal GDP of $270.11 billion. ○ The collapse of India’s trusted partner (the Soviet Union) and strained relations with the US. ○ The likelihood of an India-Pakistan conflict persisted despite efforts to diffuse nuclear war concerns, and violence in Kashmir was at an all-time high. ● India of 2023: ○ The reforms (LPG) initiated after the 1991 economic crisis led to higher GDP growth (the world’s 5th largest economy and its nominal GDP could soon touch $4 trillion), forex ~$600 billion and a significant reduc- tion in poverty. ○ India has one of the largest militaries in the world with over a hundred nuclear weap- ons. ○ Conflict with China (not Pakistan) worries India. ○ There is a general sense of foreign poli- cy optimism. The US is now one of India’s closest friends, and New Delhi enjoys strong relationships with several powerful states around the world. The role played by India in world politics: ● India is one of the pivotal swing powers of the con- temporary international system, strategically locat- ed and often playing both sides with great skills. ○ For example, in the ongoing Ukraine war, www.insightsonindia.com3 both the West (US) and Russian Federation want India to be on their side. ○ However, India, without taking any sides, is mediating between Ukraine and Russia to bring an end to the war. ● It’s a bridge between the north and south and east and west, indirectly indicating that it is a major ‘pole’ in world politics. Strength of India: ● It uses the language of mediation in global crises. ● The country’s national power has increased dra- matically, making it a force with system-shaping ca- pabilities and intentions. Challenges faced by India (domestic): ● Poverty ● GDP per capita was $1,947 in 2021 (Bangladesh - $2,227 - 40th largest military in the world) ● Infrastructural and governance issues. For exam- ple, a few days of rain brings the national capital to a standstill. ● Regional, caste, ethnic and religious divisions. The argument: ● GDP and military strength do not equal the well-be- ing of a country’s citizens. ● The gross material power that a state can exert in its foreign and security policy is not comparable to the standard of living of its citizens. Case of India: India’s domestic challenges will continue to distract the attention of its political leaders from attending to global problems - debt restructuring, climate change, global trade or non-proliferation. Way ahead for India: ● Even while India’s domestic shortcomings will con- tinue to limit its capacity to affect the world order, it must engage and shape the world order. ● It will help India to meet its foreign policy objec- tives which would have a significant impact on its economic growth, security environment and geopo- litical and geo-economic interests. Conclusion: India’s capacity to influence world politics must also be a reflection of its domestic situation, and its partici- pation in international affairs must also be motivated by the needs of its citizens.

GS2 GLOBAL REPORT ON THE FOOD CRISES (GRFC) 2023 AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENTARY PACT Syllabus: Government policies and interventions Context: The Global Report on the Food Crises (GRFC) 2023 released recently estimated that between 691 million and 783 million people in the world suffered from hunger in 2022 ( showing levels far higher than pre-pandemic 2019) Read the description of GRFC: Here What is food security? Food security is defined (from the World Food Summit of 1996) thus: “When all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an ac- tive, and healthy life”. The report highlights that: •\t Global hunger remains high •\t The prevalence of undernourishment is far above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels •\t Stunting and child wasting have declined •\t Childhood obesity has shown a non-significant in- crease •\t The number of people unable to afford a healthy diet remains substantial (about 3 billion people) •\t The cost of a healthy diet has increased globally •\t A comparison of food insecurity among rural, peri-urban and urban populations reveals that glob- al food insecurity is lower in urban areas. •\t A significant number of people will be chronically undernourished by 2030 What are the key drivers of food insecurity? •\t Economic downturns in major economies •\t Pandemic-related disruptions in 2020 led to job loss- es and reduced incomes for many people •\t Ukraine war •\t Flawed governmental policies •\t Increasing urbanisation that drives changes through the agrifood systems Solutions recommended by the report: Solutions Recommendations Identify vulnerable population groups Through informed decision-mak- ing and effective action through targeted policies and programs www.insightsonindia.com4 Promote sound nutri- tion Make nutrition a priority in gov- ernment policy, supported by civ- il society and the private sector Support healthier food outlets Enable access to healthy diets Encourage fresh and minimally processed food sales Provide policy incentives for shops to sell more fresh and min- imally processed foods Improve street food safety and quality Address infrastructure and regu- latory gaps to enhance nutrition- al safety and quality Build rural infrastruc- ture Develop quality rural and feeder roads to connect remote farms and enterprises to main road networks Support linkages be- tween small farms and enterprises Invest in warehousing, cold stor- age, electrification, digital tools, and water supply Leverage local govern- ments Involve local governments in im- plementing policies for afford- able and available healthy diets Related news: Global Parliamentary Pact Source: DTE, Global parliamentarians have formed a new multilateral body to address the issues of poverty, hunger, and malnu- trition in the agrifood system. At the Global Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition in Chile, parliamentarians from 64 countries signed the Global Parliamentary Pact, committing to push for reforms in the agrifood system to make food sustain- able and accessible to all. Features of the Pact: •\t The pact includes drafting legislation for food equi- ty and budgetary support •\t Aim: The initiative aims to meet the UN’s Sustain- able Development Goals of zero poverty, hunger, and malnutrition by 2030 •\t Political Support: The pact lends political support to policies concerning agrifood system reform, includ- ing drafting legislation for equitable food distribu- tion and providing budgetary support. •\t Progress Reporting: Parliamentarians pledged to re- port progress on various reforms, ensuring account- ability in achieving the goals. •\t Legislative Impact: The pact has led to the pro- cessing and approval of 35 laws covering various aspects, such as family farming, responsible invest- ment in agriculture, gender equality, and food loss and waste. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization facil- itates the parliamentary initiative on agrifood systems, with 45 national, regional, and sub-regional parliamentary net- works committing to it. What is the Agrifood system? The agrifood system refers to the entire process of produc- ing, processing, distributing, and consuming food, including all the activities and actors involved in the food supply chain. It encompasses agricultural production, food processing, transportation, storage, retail, and consumption. Insta Links: The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023 Mains Links: Q.

(15M) GS Paper 3 PARLIAMENTARY PANEL ON IN- TER-SERVICES ORGANISATIONS (COMMAND, CONTROL AND DIS- CIPLINE) BILL 2023 Syllabus: Various Security forces and agencies and their mandate Context: The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence has backed the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Bill 2023. About the Bill: ● It was introduced in the Lok Sabha (March 2023) and was referred to the Standing Committee on Defence by the Speaker. ● It seeks to empower the Union government to - ○ Notify the setting up of inter-services or- ganisations, including joint services com- mands, and ○ Give powers to heads of such organisations to act against personnel from any of the three services to ensure discipline and ef- fective discharge of duties. Salient features of the Bill: ● Inter-services Organisation (ISO): www.insightsonindia.com5 ○ The central government may constitute a Joint Services Command. ○ Existing ISOs (A&N Command, Defence Space Agency, NDA) will be deemed to have been constituted under the Bill. ● Superintendence and Command/Control of ISOs: ○ The superintendence of an ISO will be vest- ed in the central government. ○ While command and control over the per- sonnel serving in or attached to such an Or- ganisation will be vested in the Command- er-in-Chief or the Officer-in-Command of an ISO. ● Eligibility to be appointed as the Command- er-in-Chief or Officer-in-Command: ○ A General Officer of the regular Army (above the rank of Brigadier), ○ A Flag Officer of the Navy (rank of Admi- ral of the Fleet, Admiral, Vice-Admiral, or Rear-Admiral), or ○ An Air Officer of the Air Force (above the rank of group captain). ● Commanding Officer: A Commanding Officer - ○ Will be in command of a unit, ship, or estab- lishment and perform duties assigned by the Commander-in-Chief or Officer-in-Com- mand of the ISO. ○ Will be empowered to initiate all disci- plinary or administrative actions over the personnel appointed, deputed, posted, or attached to that ISO. Significance of the Bill: The bill is crucial because theaterisa- tion, a long-overdue military reform that will make the best use of the military’s resources to fight future wars, is current- ly under debate. Problems in the current system: ● The personnel in an ISO are currently governed by the respective laws of the three services - the Army Act 1950, the Air Force Act 1950, and the Navy Act 1957. ● When it comes to tri-services matters, the current legal framework has its limitations because officials from one service are not permitted to exert disci- plinary/ administrative actions over members of an- other service. ● For instance, a three-star general heading a joint command cannot act against air force or navy per- sonnel serving under him. ● As a consequence, the personnel serving in ISOs need to be reverted to their parent service units for any disciplinary/ administrative action. ● This is not only time-consuming but also has finan- cial implications relating to the movement of the personnel. The panel’s recommendations: ● The bill be passed without any amendments and be enacted as a statute to promote tri-services integra- tion and jointmanship in ISOs. ● The proposed law will improve the functioning of ISOs as they will be able to work with greater inde- pendence. ● The bill will enable expeditious disposal of cases, thereby affecting the standard of discipline.

Ra i si n g Awareness Children from government schools in Fateh- pur District, Uttar Pradesh, used a magazine called the WASH Vaani to promote positive WASH behaviour in rural areas. www.insightsonindia.com6 S p eci a l Campaigns Gujarat’s Swachh Sagar, Surakshit Sagar campaign involved regular beach cleaning to protect the environment. JJM DIGITAL ACADEMY Context: The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation has established the Jal Jeevan Mission Digital Academy. The academy aims to build the capacity of water and sani- tation personnel through digital technology and innovative training methods. The academy will also serve as a repository of knowl- edge-sharing sessions and best practices from national and state governments, UN agencies, and civil society organiza- tions. Usage: the example can be used in governance questions re- lated to water. Facts for Prelims (FFP) ADJOURNMENT MOTION Context: During the Monsoon Session, Congress MPs moved adjournment motions in the Lok Sabha to take up urgent dis- cussion on alleged sexual assault in Manipur. About the motion: MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREE- MENT (MRA) Context: India and Australia have formed a joint working group to explore the possibility of a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) that would facilitate Indian whiskey mak- ers’ access to the Australian market. •\t Currently, Australian rules require whiskey to be matured for two years before being labelled as such, which poses a disadvantage for Indian liquor exporters who do not have a similar requirement. •\t Indian companies argue that spirits mature more quickly in India’s warmer climate, and the two-year maturation rule restricts their access to a market with a significant Indian population and growth po- tential. What is mutual recognition agreement (MRA)? A Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) is a formal agree- ment between two or more countries or trading partners. It allows them to recognize and accept each other’s standards, regulations, and conformity assessment procedures for spe- cific products or services. •\t By doing so, MRAs aim to facilitate trade and mar- ket access by reducing redundant testing, certifica- tion, and inspection requirements. The formation of the group comes after Australia got du- ty-free access for its high-end wines under the Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (ECTA), between India and Australia. WHY MIZORAM IS OFTEN HIT BY LIVESTOCK DISEASES Context: Mizoram has been facing multiple disease out- breaks affecting its livestock and wildlife. •\t Recently, over 200 goats died from PPR (peste des petits ruminants) or goat plague in two villages of Serchhip district. •\t In the same district, more than 1,000 pigs had died of African swine fever in the past. •\t Additionally, there have been localized outbreaks of FMD (foot-and-mouth disease) in Siaha district, affecting mithuns (semi-wild bovines locally known as ‘gayal’). •\t In the past, the state has also witnessed the death of Himalayan serows due to sarcoptic mange, a skin disease caused by mites. The vulnerability of both domestic and wild animals in Mizoram to fatal diseases is attributed to the possibility of infected animals coming in from across the long interna- www.insightsonindia.com7 tional and interstate borders of the state. •\t Mizoram shares borders with Bangladesh, Myan- mar, Assam, Manipur, and Tripura, leading to large- scale imports of animals and poultry, which in- crease the risk of diseases entering the state. •\t The lack of proper quarantine and disease-checking procedures for animals procured from neighbouring areas, such as the Cachar district in Assam, has also contributed to the spread of diseases in Mizoram. •\t The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department faces challenges in tackling animal diseases due to a shortage of veterinarians and the absence of an epidemiologist. J&K’S TROUT FARMING Context: Introduced in the early 1900s, trout fish has be- come a staple on the Valley’s menu, and an increasing num- ber of farmers are now eyeing opportunities to export trout to meet European demand. •\t The favourable water and climatic conditions in Kashmir, similar to Europe, attracted small farmers initially, and now educated unemployed youth are joining the sector. The demand for trout is high, leading to solid profits for farmers, and the government offers subsidies to support the establishment of trout farms. However, climate change poses a potential threat to the industry, as the fish require specific conditions to thrive. Despite this challenge, the government is taking measures to combat climate change’s impact by offering subsidies to set up Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) for trout farming. INDIA’S FIRST CANNABIS MEDI- CINE PROJECT Context: Jammu is set to lead India’s first Cannabis Medicine Project, a collaboration between CSIR-IIIM Jammu and a Ca- nadian firm under PPP. Aim: •\t The project aims to harness the potential of can- nabis for medical purposes, particularly in treating neuropathies, cancer, and epilepsy. •\t To address drug abuse awareness in J&K and Punjab •\t Emphasizing the medicinal benefits of cannabis. Significance: •\t The cannabis research project holds promise for dis- covering therapeutic properties of the plant, previ- ously known for abuse, and obtaining regulatory approvals for clinical studies and drug development. •\t It will foster investment opportunities in Jammu and Kashmir •\t The project will boost CSIR-IIIM’s reputation as a prestigious scientific research institute in India About Cannabis: Cannabis (also called marijuana ), a psychoactive drug from the cannabis plant, has been used for recreational and medicinal purposes for centuries. In India, possession of prohibited drugs is an offence, but medical use is allowed. Cannabis-based medical treatment utilizes compounds like THC and CBD to manage conditions like chronic pain, nausea, muscle spasms, and epilepsy, interacting with the body’s endocannabinoid system. SATELLITE NETWORK PORTAL SITE Context: The Gujarat government’s Department of Science and Technology (DST) has signed a memorandum of under- standing with One Web India Communications Pvt Ltd to es- tablish a ‘satellite network portal site’ in Mehsana, Gujarat. •\t This site will serve as a signal and data downlink and uplink terminal for satellite communication. One Web’s satellite constellation operates in low Earth orbit (LEO), providing high-speed and low-latency communication. •\t The project requires civil infrastructure work, reg- ulatory approvals from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), and spectrum allocation from the Telecom Regula- tory Authority of India (TRAI). The decision to set up the SNP in Gujarat was based on geo- graphical and business interests, with Gujarat’s long coast- line making it suitable for maritime sector coverage. The state’s favourable business climate and policies also influ- enced the decision. One Web is a UK-based company, but India’s Bharti Enter- prises is a major investor and shareholder, and they are partnering with Hughes Communications India Pvt Ltd (HCI- PL), a joint venture between Hughes and Bharti Airtel Limit- ed, to sell end-user services in India. www.insightsonindia.com8 Mapping: KURNOOL (ANDHRA PRADESH) Context: Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation laid the foundation stone of a 108 feet tall statue of Lord Shri Ram in Mantralayam, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. The statue aims to spread the message of Sanatan Dharma to the world and strengthen the Vaishnava tradition. The project is located in the historic village of Mantralayam ( situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River), known for the temple of Raghavendra Swamy. CAMBODIA Cambodia’s election, held on Sunday, is expected to be won by the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, extending their long-term hold on power. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved in 2018, leaving no strong rival to the CPP. Cambodia is a Southeast Asian nation whose landscape spans low-lying plains, the Mekong Delta, mountains and the Gulf of Thailand coastline. In the country’s northwest are the ruins of Angkor Wat, a massive stone temple com- plex built during the Khmer Empire.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
