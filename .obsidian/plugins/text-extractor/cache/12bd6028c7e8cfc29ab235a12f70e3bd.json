It basically involves changing of certain keywords and going to elimination method. Once you get a hang of it becomes very fast to tick or skip the answers. ● Those getting poorer scores are because ○ a) Not revising properly → Then solution is obvious =you have to revise more ○ b) Overthinking / Birbal ki 1 9 Khichdi/engaging in hairsplittery/lawyer-LLB type mentality/ thinking outside the photo frame. ○ c) Not reading the words carefully ○ d) Silly mistakes like Incorrect statement is asked but they are taking the correct statement ○ e) Mind is stuck elsewhere in WhatsApp Telegram Netflix , fight with siblings/parents, love af fairs & breakups. so person is reading the handout / MCQ but he/she's not absorbing it properly . ● I am sure you will do well. Just focus on the lecture, revise the handouts and give the weekly Tests in regular fashion and rectify mistakes. ● When the first four pillars are over you will automatically see the big picture how everything fits together in the whole syllabus. 2 0 Q2 5 09/03/ 2023 23:32: 46 Bhupin der singh If bond holder or political party failed to donate or withdraw electrol bond amount respectively within stipulated time frame of 15 days, then what will be the next procedure after of expiring. he'll loose the money .
