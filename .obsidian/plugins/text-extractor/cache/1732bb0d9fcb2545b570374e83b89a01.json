It basically involves changing of certain keywords and going to elimination method. Once you get a hang of it becomes very fast to tick or skip the answers. ‚óè Those getting poorer scores are because ‚óã a) Not revising properly ‚Üí Then solution is obvious =you have to revise more ‚óã b) Overthinking / Birbal ki Khichdi/engaging in hairsplittery/lawyer-LLB type mentality/ thinking outside the photo frame. ‚óã c) Not reading the words carefully ‚óã d) Silly mistakes like Incorrect statement is asked but they are taking the correct statement ‚óã e) Mind is stuck elsewhere in WhatsApp Telegram Netflix , fight with siblings/parents, love af fairs & breakups. so person is reading the handout / MCQ but he/she's not absorbing it properly . ‚óè I am sure you will do well. Just focus on the lecture, revise the handouts and give the weekly Tests in regular fashion and rectify mistakes. ‚óè When the first four pillars are over you will automatically see the big picture how everything fits together in the whole syllabus. 16/02/20 2321:56:16 liza katari a can i do polity and economics together? yes u can 16/02/20 2321:56:44 Er.Puj aNay ak-99 26 Handout üö®Download Handout from Mobile App If you are using Unacademy learner app then book mark my profile page https://unacademy .com/ @mrunal.org Then on community tab ‚Üí my profile ‚Üí scrollup ‚Üí you will be able to see the notes I have uploaded by scrolling up If problem persists contact help@unacademy .com üö®Download handout from laptop/desktop Here is the link to Mrunal's PCB9-RAFT AAR Batch targeting Prelims-2023: https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-econom y-course-for-upsc-prelim s-2023-754/6ZPQTB6O Goto above link, Click on updates tab ‚Üí Side bar will open from the right side ‚Üí you can download the PDF files .

And sir please continue the same speed and don't change it with time The comprehensive course (=Prelims and Mains) is being broken into three parts 1) Feb to May: live economy for prelims https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-econom y-course-for-upsc-prelim s-2023-754/6ZPQTB6O 2) May: live microeconomics for Prelims https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-microec onomics-for-upsc-prelim s-2023-raftaar-fasttrack- edition/XR7DPX8N 3) June onwards: Mains Economy Reasons for breaking it to three parts 1. Those who are unable to purchase more than three months subscription due to shortage of money and want to deal only with prelims. 2. Those who want to finish prelims centric material before 2023‚Äô s Prelim Exam can sit in it. 3. Comprehensive prelims+mains= means combined handout becomes more than 1200 pages and lecture goes for more than 120 hrs. and then Babu Shona Janata and rival institutes are doing a lot of negative publicity against ke ‚ÄúMrunal‚Äô s handout is very lengthy . Lectures are very lengthy . very dif ficult to revise etc etc‚Äù. Then, Novice public not understanding and appreciating the comprehensiveness of it, and this is af fecting the sales. So I have broken it out into three parts to make handout size smaller . Whoever is serious enough will sit through three parts. Having said that, if someone is very keen/hellbent for Prelims+Mains combined then simple solution step1: watch (recorded) PCB7: prelim + mains course: https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-econom y-course-for-upsc-prelim s-mains-2023/M9WQ6S DA \" step2: Then update it for free with free win23 series lecture link and handouts visit mrunal.org/win23 16/02/20 2323:02:13 Anjali Mishr a Hello sir I'm just a beginner and I'm also a college student n i joined unacademy 2 months back.

I am lacking with self study only i am doing is classes not revision. Please suggest me sir https://www .loom.com/s hare/01 143547ca454fe8 be37cbdcee929261 16/02/20 2323:03:21 Sanja na Hello sir I want to ask that do I need to make notes of your lecture??any running Notes? Or just handout is enough ?? And which books I need to refer? Should I make notes from your note (handout) My economy handout is the revision note in itself. If you try to make new note out of it, you will become tired and run out of time, because then you will be left with less time to complete other subjects. So ideally if at all you want to make notes then you should make notes for optional subject and not for general studies subject. Having said that, I am not be preventing you from making notes on economy , but you need to consider the availability of time. As explained in the following Loom video https://www .loom.com/s hare/907099936a6c420 7a164a73fef4a25f9 16/02/20 2323:06:49 Sank et Namste üôèüôè sir,i am upsc 2026 aspirant,i have confusion that which batch of yours i should join to cover economic syllabus,the current one which started on feb-16-23 or should i wait for your future comprehensive batch?

I apologize if it was already discussed in the class and I missed it. Thank You! Should I make notes from your note (handout) My economy handout is the revision note in itself. If you try to make new note out of it, you will become tired and run out of time, because then you will be left with less time to complete other subjects. So ideally if at all you want to make notes then you should make notes for optional subject and not for general studies subject. Having said that, I am not be preventing you from making notes on economy , but you need to consider the availability of time.

It basically involves changing of certain keywords and going to elimination method. Once you get a hang of it becomes very fast to tick or skip the answers. ‚óè Those getting poorer scores are because ‚óã a) Not revising properly ‚Üí Then solution is obvious =you have to revise more ‚óã b) Overthinking / Birbal ki Khichdi/engaging in hairsplittery/lawyer-LLB type mentality/ thinking outside the photo frame. ‚óã c) Not reading the words carefully ‚óã d) Silly mistakes like Incorrect statement is asked but they are taking the correct statement ‚óã e) Mind is stuck elsewhere in WhatsApp Telegram Netflix , fight with siblings/parents, love af fairs & breakups. so person is reading the handout / MCQ but he/she's not absorbing it properly . ‚óè I am sure you will do well. Just focus on the lecture, revise the handouts and give the weekly Tests in regular fashion and rectify mistakes. ‚óè When the first four pillars are over you will automatically see the big picture how everything fits together in the whole syllabus. 17/02/20 2310:13:36 Aman Sir mera CDS exam hai 16 April ko And 3 attempt mne diya tha.cds ke But upsc revision me hi time nikaljaraa toh CDs pe focus nhi krpata CDS m mocks time management ki kmi h maths me.

Hope my question isn't repetitive, I have tried going over this doubt myself sir , but was not successful, hence the doubt submission, apologies for taking up your time on trivial issues. so, my question being, since I have taken the unacademy subscription of 3 months to attend your batch on economics for prelims 2023 from February . my subscription will end on may third week. you had mentioned in the class that if we want to prepare for mains answer writing and all that from the previously completed course on prelims and mains October session of post corona batch. now , since the videos that are showcased under that batch are very similar to the ones we are about to learn in the February batch, so how do i dif ferentiate between the prelims videos and the mains videos? and if so, can you please specify which videos to watch specifically for mains preparation sir so that i don't go over the same lectures over in those batches and am able to specifically learn the mains material alone. thanks in advance sir . have a great day . in that case three things live economy for prelims https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-econom y-course-for-upsc-prelim s-2023-754/6ZPQTB6O live microeconomics https://unacademy .com/ course/mrunals-microec onomics-for-upsc-prelim s-2023-raftaar-fasttrack- edition/XR7DPX8N recorded Mains QEP-2022 from last year https://unacademy .com/ course/mains-economy- revision-quality-improve ment-program-qep/H6N 2TJ6H 19/02/20 2323:29:48 _Kritik aShar ma_9 8 Hello Sir! 1. I'm not sure about my optional since I'm from science background (B.Sc Non Med, M.Sc Chem) I have appeared for pre once before this but without any preparation or much knowledge about this exam so kindly guide me. Moreover , i am pursuing B.Ed(final) regular cum non attending these days, sir I have qualified htet and most probably I'm hoping that I'll clear this ctet too (as the result will be out within few days)frankly speaking I didn't do much of it or to have a routine study or coaching stuff for these exams but managed to qualify these ... 2. I'm 24 already so should I look out for the vacancy/job and target 2024 or be strictly 2023/24 aspirant because I started with the AARAMBH BA TCH (29TH JAN). Even though I took the subscription last year but only for 2-3 months couldn't continue it..so sir help me with this dilemma. Thank You! https://www .loom.com/s hare/6f2de5f944a94dac a90df957237abd3c 19/02/20 2323:42:38 satya m SIR though u had taught this in one line. came this again in CA OF ECONOMY.

W ait till we reach pillar number3 then we'll study it in more detail. Presently we are at pillar 1. 20/02/20 2300:43:06 Sany am Prabh at q1) Hi sir , sir am your old batch student , and gave prelims last year , in which i failed to perform well , I had Doubt in this question ,but before stating the doubt , one small request , like when i was preparing for 2022 prelims you came with one series of video of prelims 2021 question of subjectwise doing the real time analysis , and not the random youtuber one stating whether it was doable or not , skip or not and how to eliminate , so please do that once , as upsc used its right of making paper unpredictable and used new patern of only one pair and so on , so how to deal with it . Second the questions like ek tha tiger of all the places in news because of negative news so how to handle , as the trend was that IR was asked less previously but in 2022 7 questions were from IR , That too which was nit directly linking india example quad etc. q2) Coming to my doubt With reference to the Indian economy , consider the following statements: 1. An increase in Nominal Ef fective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee. 2. An increase in the Real Ef fective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness. 3. An increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER. q3) https://www .loom.com/s hare/6f2de5f944a94dac a90df957237abd3c sir My subscription ended in the month of oct , i just renewed it for env course revision and this batch , but being a working professional I am not getting T ime to do it live so asking this pillar 3 question in very begininng Sorry for that ...please if possible answer this .. Going by the analysis style taught by you in exam statement 3 will be correct as Reer means you are considering inflation .But this REER and NEER concept was confusing as REEr is what ?1 rs = how many dollar or 1 dollar = how many rs . ..because if it is 1 dollar is equal to how many rs then increase of it is good for export , but if it is 1 rs= how many dollar than statement 1 is correct . and next doubt was that why by term \" improvement in trade competitiveness \" we mean improvement in export and not import , because one out of two will always be in advantage. I have watched the analysis of top coaching tutors and they were stating some formula and all , but i want its explaination in your style . I know Sir that this is not correct pillar , but please help as currently the workload is also high and I cant promise that i will be able to attend the pillar 3 live or not . ( will ask few more doubts in coming 2 -3 weeks sir , sorry in advance , and thankyou sir for all your hard ef fort , take care sir , you mean a lot for all upsc aspirants ) 20/02/20 2301:10:40 Ashmi t Swar up Sir Charan sparsh üôè Right now i m reading The Indian express (past 1 years) and when i give daily current af fairs test I get marks between 14-22 out of 30 and not happy with these marks How i can increase my marks ? https://www .loom.com/s hare/6f2de5f944a94dac a90df957237abd3c And- Is Indian express newspaper good for UPSC preparation or i should read Hindu or any other ??
