What is UCC? Uniform Civil Code refers to the proposition of having a uni- form set of civil laws for all citizens of a country, irrespec- tive of their religious or cultural affiliations. The principle behind UCC: The concept of a UCC is rooted in the idea of equality and uniformity before the law and it aims to replace the person- al laws based on religious practices that currently govern matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and succession. Historical Perspectives on UCC •\t British rule: There was a lack of uniformity in civil matters as personal laws based on religious cus- toms and traditions were recognized for different communities. The idea of a UCC emerged as a re- sponse to this fragmentation and as a means to promote a common civil identity. •\t Portuguese rule: When Goa was under Portuguese rule until 1961, a Uniform Civil Code based on the Portuguese Napoleonic code was implemented. •\t Nehruvian Vision: Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned a modern and progressive India and saw the UCC as an essential element of nation-building. He believed that a UCC would help eliminate divisions based on religion and promote equality among citizens. •\t Hindu Code Bill: The Hindu Code Bill sought to cod- ify and modernize Hindu personal laws relating to marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance. It was seen as a step towards a UCC, as it aimed to bring uniformity in personal laws within the Hindu community. •\t Shah Bano Case: The Supreme Court judgment, in this case, sparked debates on the need for a UCC to ensure gender justice and equal rights for women across religious communities. Constitutional Perspectives on UCC •\t Constituent Assembly Debates: During the framing of the Indian Constitution, the debates witnessed di- verse viewpoints, with some members advocating for a UCC as a way to promote gender equality and secularism, while others expressed concerns about preserving religious and cultural rights. •\t Directive Principles of State Policy: Article 44 of the Indian constitution states that the state shall endeavour to secure for its citizens a uniform civil www.insightsonindia.com3 code throughout the territory of India. •\t Secularism: The Indian Constitution enshrines the principle of secularism, which mandates the separation of reli- gion and the state. A UCC is seen as a way to promote secularism by ensuring equal treatment of all citizens irre- spective of their religious affiliations. •\t Equality and Non-Discrimination: The Constitution of India guarantees equality before the law under Article 14, and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. UCC would uphold these principles by ensuring equal rights and equal treatment for all citizens, regardless of their religious backgrounds. •\t Gender Justice: The Constitution also guarantees the right to equality and the right against discrimination based on gender. A UCC is seen as a means to promote gender justice. How do Personal laws govern different communities? Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis, and Jews are governed by their own personal laws. Goa has UCC, which retained its common family law known as the Goa Civil Code after it was liberated from Portuguese rule in 1961. The rest of India follows different personal laws based on their religious or community identity. All Hindus Reformed Hindu Personal Law Applies to Hindus after the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Renounced Hindus still under Hindu Law Hindu Personal Law in Special Mar- riage Act Hindus married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 are still gov- erned by Hindu Personal Law. Muslims Muslim Personal Law Muslims married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 are no longer governed by Muslim Personal Law. Argument in favour of UCC: Benefits of UCC Explanation National Integration and Sec- ularism UCC would create a common identity among citizens, fostering national integration. It promotes secularism by treating all religions equally and reducing communal conflicts. Gender Justice and Equality UCC ensures gender justice by removing discriminatory laws and granting equal rights to women in marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc. It empowers women and upholds their fundamental rights. Simplification and Rationali- sation of Legal System UCC simplifies the legal system by eliminating the complexities and contradictions of mul- tiple laws. It harmonizes civil and criminal laws and enhances accessibility for the common people. Modernisation and Reform of Outdated Practices UCC modernizes and reforms outdated practices, aligning personal laws with human rights and constitutional values. It abolishes practices like triple talaq and child marriage. Argument Against UCC: Challenges Explanation Diverse Personal Laws and Cus- tomary Practices Harmonizing India’s diverse laws and practices to establish uniformity is complex, especially when many laws are undocumented or contradictory. Resistance from Religious and Minority Groups Some religious and minority groups argue that it could impose majority views and un- dermine their constitutional rights, particularly under Article 25 guaranteeing free- dom of religion. Lack of Political Will and Con- sensus Concerns exist regarding potential communal tensions and conflicts arising from its implementation. Practical Difficulties and Com- plexities Implementing UCC would involve substantial efforts such as drafting, codifying, har- monizing, and rationalizing personal laws and practices. Law Commission Views: •\t 21st Law Commission of India: It said the “issue of uniform civil code is vast, and its potential repercussions, un- tested in India”. It said that “ UCC is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage”. •\t The government had asked the 22nd Law Commission of India to undertake an examination of various issues relat- ing to UCC. www.insightsonindia.com4 SC-related cases: Landmark Cases Ruling and Implications Shah Bano Case (1985) The Supreme Court upheld the right of a Muslim woman to claim maintenance from her husband even after the Iddat period. It highlighted the need for a UCC to re- move contradictions based on ideolo- gies. Sarla Mudgal (1995) The Supreme Court stated that a Hindu husband cannot convert to Islam and marry without dissolving his first mar- riage. It emphasized that a UCC would pre- vent fraudulent conversions and biga- mous marriages. Shayara Bano case (2017) The Supreme Court declared triple ta- laq as unconstitutional and violative of Muslim women’s dignity and equality. It recommended that Parliament enact a law to regulate Muslim marriages and divorces. Conclusion: The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India requires a balanced approach that respects multicultural- ism and diversity. Inclusive discussions with stakeholders, including religious leaders and legal experts, are essential to ensure diverse perspectives are considered. The focus should be on eliminating practices that hinder equality and gender justice while avoiding reactive culturalism. The re- form process of Muslim Personal Law should be led by the Muslim clergy, and Muslims should critically examine prac- tices to promote equality and justice. The aim is to develop a just and inclusive UCC that upholds constitutional values. Quotes related to UCC: •\t “The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will promote the integration of India by establishing a shared platform for diverse communities” •\t “The Uniform Civil Code may potentially enforce a code that is influenced by Hindu practices in all com- munities” •\t “It is imperative to ensure that certain groups or mar- ginalised segments of society are not subjected to dis- advantageous treatment during this endeavour” Insta Links: Strike a fine balance, have a just civil code Mains Links: Q.

Need for the guidelines: In 2017, to understand the linkages between food and NCDs, the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environ- ment (CSE) conducted the Know your diet — school chil- dren survey. The survey found that •\t Most schoolchildren were not eating a balanced diet •\t Children had a low frequency of intake of cereals, vegetables and millet •\t Packaged food was more popular among children than non-packaged food www.insightsonindia.com5 Previous guidelines: •\t 2010 WHO ‘Set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children •\t In March 2023, WHO published a set of nutritional criteria which aimed to protect children from marketing that promoted unhealthy food and non-alcoholic beverages. The recommendations include: Recommendations Description Implement compre- hensive mandatory policies Protect children of all ages from the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages that are high in saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, free sugars, and/or salt through the implementation of comprehensive mandatory policies. Restrict marketing of unhealthy foods Restrict the marketing of specific unhealthy food categories to children, including high in saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, free sugars and/or salt (HFSS), fast food, etc. Address marketing in various settings Address food marketing in locations where children frequently gather, such as schools and sports clubs. Also, regulate marketing during children’s television viewing times, in digital spaces popular among young people, and in magazines targeting children and adolescents. Consider country context Take into account the country’s nutritional situation, cultural context, locally available foods, di- etary customs, available resources and capacities, and existing governance structures while formu- lating policies. Use a nutrient pro- file model Encourage countries to use a nutrient profile model to identify and classify unhealthy foods and beverages that should be subject to marketing restrictions. Minimize migration of marketing Design policies that are comprehensive enough to minimize the migration of marketing across different channels or settings. Protect all children Emphasize the protection of all children, using the definition of a child from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The guidelines aim to ensure that marketing regulations apply uniformly to chil- dren of all ages, including younger and older children, to safeguard their health and well-being. Establish strong and comprehensive reg- ulations Encourage governments to establish robust and comprehensive regulations to address the aggres- sive and pervasive marketing of foods and beverages high in fats, sugars, and salt to children. Harmful Effects of Eating Non-nutritious Food for Children: Examples Nutritional deficiencies Lack of essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients necessary for growth and development. Childhood obesity Excessive consumption of sugary snacks, fast food, and sugar-sweetened beverages leads to weight gain and obesity. Increased risk of chronic dis- eases Consumption of high-fat, high-sugar, and high-sodium foods is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Poor cognitive function and academic performance Inadequate intake of nutrient-rich foods can impair brain development, leading to poor cognitive function and reduced academic performance. Dental health problems Frequent consumption of sugary foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and cavities. Disrupted eating habits and food preferences Exposure to unhealthy food marketing can influence children’s food preferences, leading to a preference for unhealthy, non-nutritious foods. Negative impact on overall health and well-being Non-nutritious food can contribute to low energy levels, fatigue, poor immune function, and a general decline in overall health and well-being. Development of unhealthy dietary patterns and lifelong habits Regular consumption of non-nutritious food during childhood can establish unhealthy di- etary patterns that persist into adulthood, leading to long-term health consequences. Decreased consumption of nutrient-dense foods Non-nutritious food choices often replace nutrient-dense options, resulting in a reduced intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre. Emotional and psychological effects Unhealthy food consumption can contribute to emotional issues like low self-esteem, poor body image, and negative relationships with food. www.insightsonindia.com6 Related news: Dark Patterns in Digital Advertisements Insta Links: Surrogate Advertising Mains Links: Do you think commercial advertisements need to be ethical?

The agenda defines ‘One Health’: The concept acknowl- edges the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the larger environment, including ecosystems, are inextricably linked and interdependent. The link between ‘One Health’ and AMR: ● At this One Health interface, addressing global health issues necessitates a multisectoral, multidis- ciplinary response to AMR. ● Using a mixed-methods approach, global experts identified five key pillars as well as three cross-cut- ting themes, as follows: Five key pillars: ● Transmission: This pillar focuses on the environ- ment, plant, animal, and human sectors where AMR transmission, circulation and spread occur. ● Integrated surveillance: This pillar aims to identify cross-cutting priority research questions in order to improve common technical understanding and infor- mation exchange among One Health stakeholders. ● Interventions: This pillar focuses on programmes, practises, tools, and activities aimed at preventing, containing, or reducing the incidence, prevalence, and spread of AMR. ● Behavioural insights and change: It focuses on re- search addressing human behaviour that affects AMR, including ways to combat it. ● Economics and policy: This pillar takes into account the cost-effectiveness of an AMR investment case, financial sustainability, and long-term financial im- pact. Purpose of priority research agenda: ● To better advocate for increased research and in- vestment in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ● To guide a variety of stakeholders in generating new evidence to address AMR, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). ● The agenda also emphasises the importance of de- veloping research capacity in LMICs, which will be critical for addressing research gaps and developing evidence. Significance of the agenda: ● It will serve as a guide for countries, research in- stitutes and funding bodies to support One Health AMR research. ● It will also allow policymakers, researchers, and the multidisciplinary scientific community to collaborate across sectors. Other similar efforts: WHO also launched a global research agenda for AMR in human health, prioritising 40 research topics for evidence generation to inform policy and inter- ventions by 2030. Way ahead: The priority research agenda requires contextu- alisation at the regional and country level and the develop- ment of specific research relevant to the needs of different countries and One Health settings. Conclusion: Implementing this research agenda will address the threat of AMR and support the national action plan (NAP) implementation and achievement of the SDGs for 2030.

Context: The US is eyeing a controversial tool to counter global warming: Solar geoengineering. What is Solar geoengineering? ● Solar geoengineering, also referred to as solar ra- diation management (SRM) describes a set of pro- posed approaches to reflect sunlight (back to space) to rapidly cool the Earth. ● Within solar geoengineering, researchers are con- sidering two main approaches. Different SRM methods: ● Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI): It involves in- jecting tiny reflecting particles, known as aerosols, into the upper atmosphere to cool the planet. ● Marine cloud brightening (MCB): It would use sea salt to stimulate cloud formation over the ocean, which would also help reflect sunlight in the region. Why is solar geoengineering being considered? ● The Paris Agreement’s target requires limiting global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. ● For this, nations need to bring net global CO2 emis- sions to zero by no later than mid-century. ● Despite these ambitious goals, solar geoengineer- ing is being considered to prepare for the possibility that global efforts may fall short. The USA’s plan: ● The White House stated that public or private actors could carry out activities such as injecting aerosols and MCB to reflect more sunlight into space. ● It called for research to enable better-informed de- cisions about the potential risks and benefits of the tool as part of its climate policy, in addition to miti- gation and adaptation. ● This comes amid concerns raised by the experts over the high environmental (changes in precipita- tion patterns, ozone amounts, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, etc), social, and geopolitical risks that come with SRM. Solar geoengineering risks: ● Moral hazard: The danger is that the technology will become an excuse to slow emissions reductions and stop moving toward a low-carbon economy. ● Little is known about its impacts: Research to scope the risks and potential of solar geoengineering has mostly been conducted through computer-based modelling and natural observations (volcanic erup- tion). Way ahead: Because solar geoengineering has global impli- cations, its consideration as a climate response requires - ● Effective international governance/ Mechanisms for oversight. ● Outdoor experimentation and funding for experi- ments should come only from governments. ● Ways to involve the public in decision-making. Conclusion: ● Given the ethical and environmental risks these ac- tivities can present, atmospheric experiments to as- sess these technologies deserve timely public scru- tiny and debate. ● Even as researchers assess the potential feasibility and effectiveness of geoengineering approaches, mitigation and adaptation must remain our first- line solutions.

Facts for Prelims (FFP) LORD LANSDOWNE Context: The Lansdowne Cantonment Board has decided to rename the hill station of Lansdowne in Uttarakhand, India, as Jaswantgarh in honour of Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat, Maha Vir Chakra recipient and hero of the 1962 war with China. About Lord Lansdowne (served as the Viceroy of India from 1888 to 1894): Title Lord Lansdowne Background Lord Lansdowne arrived on the sub- continent when revenue was dwindling for the British, a constrained scheme for political reform, and unsettled rela- tions with the amir of Afghanistan and the peoples of the northwestern fron- tier. Indian National Congress Lord Lansdowne legitimized the work of the Indian National Congress, rec- ognizing the rise of Indian nationalism as an inevitable byproduct of the Brit- ish administration. Indian Factory Act, 1891 The Indian Factory Act, 1891 was passed when Lord Lansdowne was the Viceroy of India. Categorizing of Civil Services On Aitchison Commission recommen- dations (1889), Statutory Civil Service was abolished. The government’s ci- vilian officers were divided into three classes: Imperial Indian Civil Service, Provincial Civil Service, and Subordi- nate Civil Service. Age of Consent Act, 1891 The Age of Consent Act, 1891, was en- acted in British India in 1891, raising the age of consent for sexual inter- course for all girls, married or unmar- ried, from ten to twelve years in all ju- risdictions, with violations punishable as rape. Indian Councils Act Lord Lansdowne introduced the Indi- an Councils Act of 1892, which estab- lished additional members in the cen- tral and provincial legislative councils and introduced an indirect election system for council members. It was a step toward a representative govern- ment in India. Setting up Du- rand Commis- sion (1893) Durand Line agreement was signed to secure the north-west and Afghanistan Opium Commis- sion In 1893, a royal commission was is- sued to inquire into the results of using opium in India, and the possibil- ity of prohibiting it. The commission’s findings favoured the continued use of opium and led to the shelving of the idea of imposing a ban. www.insightsonindia.com9 CENTRE ANNOUNCES SCHEME FOR MINOR RAPE VICTIMS Context: The Indian government has launched a special scheme to provide support to minor rape victims who be- come pregnant as a result of the sexual assault. •\t The scheme, announced by the Women and Child Development Ministry, will operate under the Nir- bhaya Fund.
