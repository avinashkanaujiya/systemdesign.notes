Benefits of signing Artemis Accords • A lot of what India plans to do in space — human missions, moon landings, planetary explorations, setting up a space station — has already been done by countries like the US, Russia or China. • Joining the alliance is an attempt by India to start collaborating on the next generation of technologies. Concerns / Challenges • Russia has been India’s most trusted partner in the space sector. • Russia had offered its facilities to train Indian astronauts for the Gaganyaan mission. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Joining an alliance that is aimed at promoting US interests in space is not likely to be seen very favourably by Russia. • Seeking collaboration with other nations could potentially lead to over-reliance on external technologies. • Potential loss of autonomy and decision-making power in shaping its own space program. Way Forward • India should proactively engage in diplomatic efforts to ensure smooth collaboration with other nations, including Russia. • India should actively engage with other member nations of the alliance and seek opportunities for collaboration in space exploration. • Balancing collaboration with maintaining independence and pursuing national objectives becomes crucial for India. • It is essential for India to address other needs such as poverty alleviation, healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. Conclusion • India should also continue pursuing its independent space goals, apart from such collaborations. • By doing so, India can position itself as a key player in the global space arena and propel its space program to new heights.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
