Syllabus: Effects of Globalization on Indian Society/ Social Empowerment, Communalism, Regionalism & Secularism Context: After the police killed a teenager (Nahel) of Alge- rian descent in Nanterre (France), violent protests spread across France. France’s ethnic composition: ● France is one of the most racially and ethnically di- verse countries in Europe. ● At least 32% of France’s population under 60 has at least one immigrant ancestor → trace their origins to countries outside Europe, especially Africa. The French African colonies: ● The formal French presence in Africa began with the capture of Madagascar in 1642 and the establish- ment of a port at Saint-Louis (present-day Senegal) in 1659. ● This was primarily fuelled by France’s desire to se- cure access to commodities such as gum Arabic and groundnuts, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade. ● A second phase of French colonisation began with the invasion of Algiers in 1830. ● By the early years of the 20th century, France held present-day Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Mali, Burki- na Faso, Benin, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Niger. ● However, almost all of France’s African colonies achieved independence by 1962. The root cause behind the killing: ● Systemic racism in French policing: Young men who are Black/ of North African descent, are 20 times more likely to be subjected to police identity checks than the rest of the population. ● The Continuing France’s Sphere of Influence and Migration: ○ Critics say France’s exploitative relationship www.insightsonindia.com3 (Neocolonialism/ Last Stage of Imperialism) with its former colonies still continues. ○ This includes repeatedly intervening in political affairs, having a considerable mili- tary presence and several economically ex- tractive processes. ○ An outcome of this situation - Africa’s con- tinued impoverishment and the allure of Eu- ropean riches and quality of life - has been extensive migration from Africa to Europe. ○ For former French countries, France has been the preferred destination, where mini- mum wages and workers’ rights are assured. ● The failure of assimilation: ○ After World War II, France suffered from massive labour shortages and actively lured cheap labour from its colonies. ○ Over the decades, this led to a thriving Af- rican population in France, many of whom are today naturalised citizens. ○ However, France’s uniqueness lies in the “physical presence and conceptual absence of cultural difference” - as it does not see itself as a pluralist or multicultural society. ○ The French state has focussed on “assimilat- ing” its diverse population into the “French ideal” by strictly adhering to political egali- tarianism. ○ Yet, this attempt at assimilation has re- mained incomplete, leading to deep ten- sions in French society. ● Discrimination: African immigrants are among the poorest in the country → lowest levels of education, the highest levels of unemployment → highest rates of crime → bear the brunt of police violence, accen- tuated by ingrained racial attitudes. Lessons to be learnt from India: ● Secularism: ● Unity in diversity: ○ It relates to the state of togetherness or in- tegrity despite the presence of infinite di- versity. ○ In India, it can be seen through national in- tegration, growth and development, global recognition and peaceful coexistence. Conclusion: In the era of globalisation and increased migra- tion, governments should prefer a ‘salad bowl’ (an inter- cultural society can integrate different cultures while main- taining their separate identities) rather than a ‘melting pot’ (monoculture) metaphor.

We already covered a summary of the News (Affirmative Action in Higher Education). Here we will com- pare the affirmative actions of India and the USA. Meaning of Affirmative Action: Affirmative action refers to policies and practices aimed at promoting equal opportunities for historically disadvan- taged groups, particularly in areas such as education, em- ployment, and government contracts. It involves taking proactive steps to address past discrimina- tion and promote diversity and inclusion. Affirmative action can involve measures such as preferential treatment, quo- tas, or targeted outreach programs to ensure representa- tion and equal access to opportunities for underrepresented groups. Comparison of affirmative action in India and the United States: Dimension Affirmative Action in India Affirmative Action in the USA Purpose Address historical social and eco- nomic inequalities based on caste Address historical dis- crimination based on Race T a rg e t e d Groups Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans www.insightsonindia.com4 R eser v a- tion System Reservation Quo- ta policies provide reserved seats in education, employ- ment, and politics Quota systems are not used. Instead, diversity and inclusive policies are encouraged in the admission practices that seek to increase the representation of Black, Hispanic and other minority stu- dents in colleges and universities. Origin William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882 originally con- ceived the idea of a caste-based reser- vation system. Fun- damental right un- der Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Independent India constitution. Civil Rights Act of 1964 which ban dis- crimination on various grounds. R eser v a- tion Per- centage Fixed at 50% (Indra Sawhney judge- ment) for OBC, SC & ST in both em- ployment and edu- cation No fixed percentage. It depends on the in- stitution or program and varies for different states of the USA Criteria for Eligibility Caste-based iden- tity; Social, Educa- tion and economic (EWS quota) back- wardness Race, ethnicity, and historical disadvantage Duration Originally intend- ed as a temporary measure in the In- dian constitution, but extended to achieve social jus- tice Continues to evolve based on societal changes and legal in- terpretations Controver- sies The debate over extending reser- vations to other communities and concerns about re- verse discrimina- tion e.g., 2006 Anti-Res- ervation Protests; Patel and Jats de- manding reserva- tion Controversies around misuse of affirmative policies. The Argument for Affirmative Action: Affirmative Action is a necessary policy to rectify the long-standing historical injustices faced by marginalized communities. It provides them with access to education, jobs, and public services, enabling social mobility and breaking the cycle of poverty. By promoting diversity and inclusion, reservation contributes to a more equitable and harmonious society. Argument Against Affirmative Actions: While the intention of Affirmative Action is laudable, it has some unintended consequences. Reservation can lead to di- visions and animosity among different groups, and it may perpetuate the notion of caste in society. It also hampers meritocracy, as deserving candidates may be overlooked in favour of less qualified candidates from reserved categories. Instead, a more targeted and comprehensive approach ad- dressing economic backwardness could be considered. Way Forward: To strike a balance, Affirmative policies should be reevaluat- ed to target the most marginalized and economically disad- vantaged individuals rather than perpetuating caste-based reservations. A strong focus on quality education and skill development for all, regardless of caste or creed, will em- power the marginalized and ensure equal opportunities. Conclusion: Public awareness and dialogue on the purpose and imple- mentation of reservation are essential to foster understand- ing and cooperation among diverse sections of society. Mains Links: Q.

What is CSR? ● It is a commitment by businesses to integrate social and environmental concerns into their business op- erations. ● India became the first country in the world to make corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandatory, fol- lowing an amendment to the Companies Act, 2013 www.insightsonindia.com5 in April 2014. ● Businesses can invest at least 2% of their net profit (over the preceding 3 years) in areas such as educa- tion, poverty, gender equality, and hunger as part of any CSR compliance. Significance: Every company has a moral responsibility to play an active role in discharging social obligations, subject to the financial health of the company. CSR trends in India: ● Since the applicability of the mandatory CSR provi- sion in 2014, CSR spending by corporate India has increased significantly. ● For example, CSR spending stood at Rs 26,210 crore in FY21, having grown 80% from FY16. ● The education sector received the maximum fund- ing (38%) followed by hunger, poverty, and health- care (25%), environmental sustainability (12%), and rural development (11%). Examples of CSR in India: ● Tata Group: It has engaged in women empower- ment activities, income generation, rural communi- ty development, and other social welfare programs. ● Ultratech Cement: The company has organised medical camps, immunisation programs, sanitiza- tion programs, water conservation programs, organ- ic farming programs, etc. ● Mahindra & Mahindra: It runs programs such as Nanhi Kali focusing on education for girls, Mahindra Pride Schools for industrial training, and Lifeline Ex- press for healthcare services in remote areas. Concerns: ● The impact of the CSR funds is not widely felt. ● Programs such as technology incubators, sports, and armed forces, reducing inequalities saw negligible spending. ● Regional disparities as the Companies Act require companies should give preference to the areas around which they operate while allocating CSR funds. Way ahead: ● Companies need to adopt a long-term approach “to yield productive results”. This will - ○ Enhance the visibility as well as the impact of invested funds ○ Strike the right balance of capital invest- ments and operational expenses ○ Ensure the initiatives undertaken become self-sustaining - running seamlessly without being a burden on the companies them- selves. ● The highest quality risk management framework needs to be adopted, so as to make the CSR projects sustainable ● It is imperative to strike a balance between local area preferences with national priorities to avoid any concentration of CSR funds in specific regions. Conclusion: The emphasis should be on creating an appro- priate structure for CSR, ensuring that the funds go towards the well-being of the community.

About Goods and Services Tax (GST): ● It is an indirect tax (not directly paid by customers to the government) that came into effect on July 1, 2017, as a result of the 101st Amendment to the Indian Constitution. ● It is imposed on both manufacturers and sellers of goods, as well as suppliers of services. ● For tax collection, it is divided into five tax slabs - 0%, www.insightsonindia.com6 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. About GST Council: ● It is an apex committee to modify, reconciles or make recommendations to the Union and the States on GST, like the goods and services that may be sub- jected or exempted from GST, model GST laws, etc. ● Article 279A of the Indian Constitution empowers the President of India to constitute a joint forum of the Centre and States called the GST Council. Need for GST: ● The inclusion of several indirect taxes at various levels of the supply chain hampered the Indian tax system. ● This resulted in a complicated and fragmented tax framework that included excise duty, service tax, VAT, central sales tax (CST), and other taxes. ● These led to tax cascading (tax on tax), raising the entire tax burden on goods and services. ● Hence, the primary goal of GST is - ○ To simplify the tax system by substituting a single indirect tax for several indirect levies ○ Eliminating tax cascading by establishing a uniform tax structure Achievements of GST: ● Revenue collection: ○ The average growth rate of Gross GST rev- enue from 2018-19 to 2022-23 stands at 12.3%, surpassing the nominal GDP growth rate of 9.8%. ○ The (June 2023) collection has crossed the 1.6 lakh crore mark for the 4th time since the inception of GST. ○ This is noteworthy as indirect taxes typically exhibit lower buoyancy - an increase in its revenue rate without increasing the tax rate. ● A seamless market and digitised compliance: ○ GST laid the foundation for a seamless na- tional market, reshaping India’s tax land- scape and driving economic growth. ○ By digitising processes from registration to return filing, the GST portal ensured smoother compliance for businesses, fos- tering a tech-enabled environment. ○ It paved the way for other significant indi- rect tax reforms, including e-way bills and e-invoicing, promoting transparent data sharing between businesses and the gov- ernment. ● Empowering the manufacturing sector: GST’s im- pact on the manufacturing sector was remarkable, as it eliminated the cascading effect of taxes and re- duced manufacturing costs. Challenges still persisting: ● Complexities in return forms and the ambiguity surrounding tax rates and classifications of certain goods and services lead to disputes and uncertain- ty. ● Combating tax fraud remained a priority, with mea- sures in place to ensure compliance and weed out fraudulent businesses. Some areas that deserve attention are: ● Commence taxation of petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, petrol, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel and similarly, alcohol meant for human consump- tion; ● Inclusion of other levies such as electricity duty, stamp duty, etc; ● Clarifying taxation of online gaming activities, trans- actions involving cryptocurrency, etc. ● The officials should also look into rationalisation of the tax rates (slabs); upgrading the law to deal with a digital world and keep up with the various techno- logical developments. Conclusion: ● The implementation of GST has definitely been a success but is still a new reform with the potential to witness phenomenal growth and harmonisation in the coming years. ● GST has shown immense promise, reshaping the economy and driving digitization while also con- fronting challenges and fraud.

TAM PÀ LING CAVE Context: New research published in Nature Communica- tions has revealed that humans arrived in Southeast Asia much earlier than previously thought. The findings are based on evidence found in Tam Pà Ling Cave in northern Laos. Findings: •\t Early human migration to Asia involved the arrival of Homo sapiens in Southeast Asia at least 68,000 www.insightsonindia.com9 years ago, according to recent evidence from Tam Pà Ling Cave in Northern Laos. •\t This discovery challenges previous assumptions and suggests that the region, including mainland, coast- al, and island locations, could have been a viable dis- persal route. •\t The presence of Denisovans, an extinct human relative, further highlights the complexity of early human movements and interbreeding with other hominin species. •\t Significance of the finding: The discoveries in Tam Pà Ling Cave contribute to our understanding of the ancient human journey across the world. About Tam Pà Ling Cave: Tam Pa Ling is a cave in the Annamite Mountains in north- eastern Laos. It is situated at the top of Pa Hang Mountain, 1,170 m above sea level. Who were Denisovans? Denisovans were an extinct group of hominins, or human relatives, known primarily from remains found in Siberia and Tibet. They lived hundreds of thousands of years ago and coexisted with Neanderthals and early modern humans. Dating method used in the cave: Dating Method Description Lu mi n escen ce dating Measures the last exposure of crystal- line materials to sunlight or heat. Uses quartz and feldspar. Uranium series dating Measures uranium and its decay prod- ucts within a tooth to determine its age.
