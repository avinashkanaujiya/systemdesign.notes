PREVIOUS YEARS’ QUESTIONS 3 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Anti-Defection Law  Parliamentary Committees  Parliamentary Efficiency  SLC Review Focal Areas 4 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish ANTI-DEFECTION LAW INTRODUCTION The anti-defection law was passed in 1985 through the 52nd Amendment to the Constitution. The Amendment added the Tenth Schedule to the Indian Constitution, with an intent to curb “the evil of political defections”. Under the anti-defection law, legislators may be disqualified from their membership to the House if they resign from their party after being elected, or defy the direction issued by the party leadership during a vote on any issue. ADL: Context • Jignesh Mewani, an independent MLA from Gujarat, has said he has joined the Congress “in spirit” as he could not formally do so, having been elected as an independent. • In West Bengal, a disqualification petition against Mukul Roy, BJP MLA now back in the Trinamool Congress, was been pending with the Assembly Speaker since June 2021. He had contested and won the 2021 Assembly elections on a BJPticket and then joined the Trinamool Congress. Calcutta HC had to intervene by referring to a SC order. • In Jharkhand, former CM Babulal Marandi faces such proceedings after merging his party, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik), with the BJP • In Rajasthan, six Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP) MLAs have merged their legislature party with the ruling Congress, a move challenged by the BSP, and the Supreme Court recently gave the six MLAs a final opportunity to explain the merger • In Lok Sabha, two Trinamool and one YSR Congress Party MPs face proceedings. The Trinamool Congress wants to disqualify its two MPs (one of them is Sisir Adhikari, father of Suvendu) for joining the BJP, and the YSRCP wants to disqualify its MP for “anti-party activities”. • In 2019 in Goa, 10 of the 15 Congress MLAs merged their legislature party with the BJP. In the same year, in Rajasthan, six BSP MLAs merged their party with the Congress (the case being heard in the Supreme Court), and in Sikkim, 10 of the 15 MLAs of the Sikkim Democratic Front have joined the BJP. • In 2020, the Supreme Court (Keisham Meghachandra Singh v. Manipur Legislative Assembly) dismissed a minister in Manipur when the Speaker did not decide the defection petition against him even after three years. The court held that ideally, Speakers should take a decision on a defection petition within three months. • A private member bill has been introduced by KTS Tulsi in the 2021 winter session in the RS to amend the law by imposing a 3 months deadline to decide Anti Defection Cases. 5 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish EVOLUTION OF THE LAW  1967-1972: 2000 cases of defection and counter-defections amongst 4000 MPs and MLAs  1967: 116/210 defected legislators became Ministers  50% legislators changed parties minimum once  Constitutional Amendment Bills were floated in 1973 but failed to pass  Finally, the 52nd CA marked the beginning of the Anti-Defection law 6 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish WHAT DOES THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW SAY?  The anti-defection law deals with situations of defection in Parliament or state legislatures by: (i) members of a political party, (ii) independent members, and (iii) nominated members.  In limited circumstances, the law allows legislators to change their party without incurring the risk of disqualification. WHY WAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW ENACTED? Two key arguments have been used to justify an anti-defection law. Firstly, it intends to combat political defections fueled by political corruption and bribery.  In the years preceding the passage of the anti-defection law, it was noted that legislators were often given the lure of executive office, or promised personal benefits, in order to encourage them to defect from their party. 7 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Minister YB Chavan (1969) to examine the need for an anti-defection law, noted that out of 210 defecting legislators of various states in India, 116 were given ministerial positions in the new government which they helped form. It recommended that for defections that were fueled by monetary gains or by the lure for political office, the defectors should not only be barred from office, but should also be barred from standing in future elections for a prescribed time period. Secondly, defections flout the voters’ mandate.  This argument is based on a recognition of the role of political parties in the parliamentary system. The argument is that most candidates are elected on the basis of the party which gives them a ticket  The party also arranges for election expenses of the candidate and the candidate fights the election based on the manifesto of the party. Therefore, when a member defects from the party, he betrays the fundamental trust based on which people elected him to power. CONTENTIOUS ISSUES  Does the law, while deterring defections, restrict a legislator from voting as per his conscience and erode his independence?  Does the law lead to suppression of healthy intra-party debate and dissent?  Does it restrict representatives from voicing the concerns of their voters in opposition to the official party position?  Should the decision on defections be judged by the Speaker who is usually a member of the ruling party or coalition, or should it be decided by an external neutral body such as the Election Commission? EFFECT OF ANTI – DEFECTION LAW ON THE ROLE OF A LEGISLATOR  The anti-defection law provides for disqualification of a legislator if he votes contrary to the party whip.  As a result, members are compelled to obey the party whip, in order to avoid losing their seat in the House. The law raises questions on the role of a legislator.  It restrains legislators from expressing their conscience in the House.  It breaks the link of accountability between the voter and the elected representative.  It disturbs the balance of power between the executive and the legislature, by constraining the ability of a member to hold the government accountable. 8 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  It leads to major decisions in the House being taken by a few party leaders and empowers party leaders to compel legislators to vote as per their instructions. HOW HAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW COMPROMISED THE ROLE OF A LEGISLATOR?  In a parliamentary system, legislators are expected to exercise their independent judgement while determining their position on an issue.  The choice of the member may be based on a combination of public interest, constituency interests, and party affiliations.  This fundamental freedom of choice could be undermined if the member is mandated to vote along the party line on every Bill or motion  Even if the member has an opinion that differs from his party leadership, he does not have the freedom to vote as per his choice.  For example, in a discussion on river water sharing between states, MPs representing constituencies in different states may be forced to vote in a unanimous manner, despite holding divergent views, in order to avoid the risk of disqualification from office. HOW HAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW AFFECTED A LEGISLATOR’S ABILITY TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE?  One of the key features of a parliamentary democracy is that the government is accountable for its decisions to Parliament. This accountability is tested through questions posed to Ministers, discussions on various government policies, and by debating national issues. The directly elected House may even dismiss the government by way of a no confidence motion.  However, the anti-defection law deters a legislator from his duty to hold the government accountable, by requiring him to follow the instruction of the party leadership on almost every decision. Therefore, he may debate and dissent from his party position on an issue in Parliament but will still be compelled to vote as per the instruction of the party whip. This may raise a question on the redundancy of debate on issues in the House.  For example, in December 2012, there was a vote in Lok Sabha on whether 51% foreign direct investment should be allowed in multi-brand retail. During the vote, all the members of the Congress party in the House voted for the policy and all the members of the BJP voted against the policy. It is unlikely that all legislators from a party had an identical stance on an issue with such wide-ranging implications.  By definition, the party or coalition in power has the majority of the membership in Lok Sabha. By prohibiting dissent, the anti-defection undermines the system of executive accountability to the legislature and gives the executive control over Parliament on all votes. As a result, the legislator is no longer empowered to act as an effective check on the government of the day. 9 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish HOW HAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW AFFECTED A CITIZEN’S ABILITY TO HOLD HIS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE ACCOUNTABLE?  The anti-defection also law breaks the chain of accountability between elected representatives and the voter. In India, citizens choose their member for a period of five years. During this term, they can judge the performance of the member based on his parliamentary record.  For example, a citizen may have a strong opinion on the issue of land acquisition. He may convey this opinion to the legislator and ask him to vote in a particular way. The legislator will have to justify his decision if he differs from such view. Thus, citizens have the opportunity to have their views represented in the legislature, and if they feel the legislator has failed to do so, they can express their displeasure or even vote out the representative in the next election.  However, under the anti-defection law this accountability mechanism breaks down. Every member is required to vote as per the direction issued by their party. He can easily justify his voting decisions and absolve himself of this representational responsibility to his voters by merely saying that the party whip compelled him to vote in a particular way.  For example, there may be a vote on a Bill in Parliament to regulate fish trawling, given its environmental impact. An MP representing a coastal constituency where large-scale fish trawling supports the local economy, may be required to vote in favour of a Bill, if a party whip is issued. If a voter from his constituency asks him to justify his support on the issue, the MP may say he had no choice given the anti-defection law. If he dissented from the party line, he would lose his seat, and would be unable to work for the citizens’ interests on other issues. This further reduces the accountability of elected representatives to citizens. HOW HAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW IMPACTED DECISION-MAKING IN THE HOUSE?  The anti-defection law leads to major decisions in the legislature being taken by a few party leaders and not by the larger body of legislators. In India, political parties frequently issue whips on matters which are subject to a vote in Parliament. This implies that anyone who controls the party leadership can issue directions to all legislators. Thus, voting in the House will be as per the wishes of a few party leaders rather than the beliefs of all legislators.  This reduces Parliament from a deliberative body to one where party leaders are able to unilaterally decide the vote on an issue, without consulting with members of their political party. As a result, to win a motion in Parliament, the government is only required to consult with leaders of the major political parties in the House. This number for consensus may further be reduced if a single party has majority in the House. For example, if the ruling party has a majority in the House and the party leader issues a whip during a vote on an issue, the government’s policy can be upheld without needing to build support of any other MPs within the party or outside 10 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish HOW DO OTHER DEMOCRACIES DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF POLITICAL DEFECTIONS?  The issue of political defections is not unique to India. Mature democracies, such as the US, UK, and Canada, do not have an anti- defection law. Parties may issue directions or exert pressure if a member goes against the party line. However, legislators are not disqualified for defying the directives of their party. For example, whips are often issued by political parties in the UK. If an individual MP or MLA defies the whip, they continue to retain their membership to the legislature (although the party may take disciplinary action against them).  Currently, among the 40 countries that have an anti-defection law, only six countries have a law that mandates legislators to vote according to party diktat.  The remaining countries only disqualify legislators if they are found to resign from their party or be expelled from it.  Only 6 countries disqualify legislators who defy party whip - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe HAS THE ANTI – DEFECTION LAW ACHIEVED ITS OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING POLITICAL STABILITY?  Whips have been regularly defied in both Centre and States on important votes affecting government stability.  2008 Confidence Motion (Centre) : A confidence motion was moved by the United Progressive Alliance government in Lok Sabha in July 2008.The motion was necessitated since the Communist Party of India (Marxist) withdrew support from the government over the nuclear deal with the USA. Although the anti-defection law was in force, 21 MPs defied the whips issued by their party while voting on the motion.  2016 Appropriation Bill (Uttarakhand) : Nine MLAs of the ruling party sided with the with the opposition in demanding a counting of votes on an Appropriation Bill that could have potentially led to the downfall of the Congress government.  2015 No-Confidence Motion (Arunachal Pradesh) : In 2015, 20 Congress (ruling party) MLAs defected in Arunachal Pradesh. These MLAs with the opposition passed a no-confidence vote against the ruling government in a special session. In 2016,the Supreme Court held the dismissal of the Congress government as illegal and called for its restoration. HAS THE LAW ENSURED IMPARTIAL DECISIONS ON DEFECTIONS?  There have been several instances where the anti-defection law has failed at achieving these objectives. As the law does not fix a time frame within which presiding officers are required to decide disqualification petitions, in several cases, the Speaker has rendered decisions after a long period of time. In some cases, the delay in rendering decisions has resulted in defecting 11 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish members continuing to be members of the House for a significant term of the assembly and even becoming Ministers while still retaining membership of their original political party.  Andhra Pradesh: 23 YSR Congress Party MLAs defected to the ruling Telegu Desam Party from 2015-18. No action was taken by the Speaker on the petitions seeking their disqualification. Further, four of these legislators were appointed as Ministers in the government.  Telangana: 26 MLAs defected from opposition parties to Telangana Rashtriya Samiti from 2014-18. No action was taken by the speaker against these defectors. Out of these defect ors, 12 were made Ministers.  This has defeated the objective of expeditious disposal of defection petitions. Over the years, courts have also expressed concern about the delay in deciding such petitions.  Rajya Sabha Chairman has recommended that all disqualification petitions should be decided by the presiding officer within three months  The Law Commission (2015) noted that the Speaker is elected by a majority vote of the House and is usually the nominee of the ruling party or coalition. 12 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish 13 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish PRIVATE MEMBER BILLS Context • Winter Session: November 29, 2021 – December 23, 2021 : • 26 Bills are listed for introduction, consideration, and passing • 15 Pvt Mem Bills in RS and 10 in LS have been introduced  Academic Integrity  Universal Health Care  Population Control • 5 private member bills seek to amend the Constitution  Preamble Amendment  Anti-Defection  Increasing LS, RS seats, UT representation to LS, women reservation  Representation to Chandigarh at RS  Contempt Private Member Bills • Every Member of Parliament, who is not a Minister, is called a Private Member. Private Members’ Bills are Bills introduced by these MPs. • In Lok Sabha, the last two and a half hours of a sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of Private Members’ Business, i.e., Private Members’ Bills and Private Members’ Resolutions. • Till date, Parliament has passed 14 Private Members’ Bills. Six of these were passed in 1956 alone. • The last Private Members’ Bill passed by Parliament was ‘The Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Bill, 1968’ that became an Act on 9th August, 1970. • A party’s average per head contribution of Private Members’ Bills usually decreases when it forms the Government. 14 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish PROCEDURE • Given the large number of Bills introduced each session, selection for discussion is done through ballot • The Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions classifies the Bills according to their nature, urgency and importance. • The House then decides the relative precedence in each category. PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE • Parliamentary privilege refers to rights and immunities enjoyed by Parliament as an institution and MPs in their individual capacity, without which they cannot discharge their functions as entrusted upon them by the Constitution. • According to the Constitution, the powers, privileges and immunities of Parliament and MP's are to be defined by Parliament • No law has so far been enacted in this respect. In the absence of any such law, it continues to be governed by British Parliamentary conventions. • A breach of privilege is a violation of any of the privileges of MPs/Parliament. Among other things, any action 'casting reflections' on MPs, parliament or its committees; could be considered breach of privilege. This may include publishing of news items, editorials or statements made in newspaper/magazine/TV interviews or in public speeches. THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES ENJOYED BY AN MLA OR MP? • The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the MPs and MLAs include: 1. Freedom of speech in the house which means they cannot be prosecuted for saying or doing anything in the house. 2. They have the freedom from arrest 40 days prior or after a session of legislature or during the session or from the premises of the legislature without the permission of the house. 3. The legislature has the power to regulate its internal affairs — that covers the behaviour including disruptions, vandalism and violence — of the house. Police or courts cannot interfere. • However, the members can be punished for the breach of privileges by the house itself. Punishment includes imprisonment, fine or suspension. 15 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PRIVILEGES & IMMUNITIES 1. The powers, privileges and immunities of Parliament and its members and committees are laid down in Article 105 of the Constitution. Article 194 deals with the same in the case of state legislatures, their members and committees. 2. The elected representatives can claim these privileges only during the period for which the person is a member of the house. 3. The argument has been that privileges and immunities are necessary for exercising constitutional functions. • The house can ensure attendance of the offending person. The person can be given a warning and let go or be sent to prison as the case may be. • In 1967, two people were held to be in contempt of Rajya Sabha, for having thrown leaflets from the visitors' gallery. In 1983, one person was held in breach for shouting slogans and throwing chappals from the visitors' gallery. They were sent to prison. • In the 2007 case of breach of privilege against Ambassador Ronen Sen, the Lok Sabha Committee on privileges held that the phrase \"headless chicken\" was not used by Shri Sen in respect of MPs or politicians. No action was taken against him • In 2008, an editor of an Urdu weekly referred to the deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha as a \"coward\" attributing motives to a decision taken by him. The privileges committee held the editor guilty of breach of privilege. • The Monsoon Session was the third least productive Lok Sabha session of the last two decades • The worst Session in terms of productivity for both Houses was the Winter Session of 2010. (2G) • The Winter Sessions of 2013 and 2016 were the second worst-hit in terms of productivity. (Telangana & Demonetisation) • March 2020, seven Congress MPs — Gaurav Gogoi, T N Prathapan, Manickam Tagore, Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Benny Behanan, Rajmohan Unnithan, and Adv. Dean Kuriakose — were suspended from Lok Sabha for the rest of the Budget Session. They were accused of snatching papers from the Speaker’s table as the Opposition strongly demanded a discussion on the Delhi riots. 2021 SC Judgment • It does not directly deal with Parliament but with state legislatures 16 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish • The Supreme Court ruled elected representatives could no longer go scot-free for acts of vandalism and violence committed inside a house claiming immunity provided under the Constitution. • The Supreme Court judgment takes away the protection of privileges and immunities making elected representatives liable for prosecution for their acts • The Supreme Court observed that “destruction of property in the assembly cannot be equated to freedom of speech in the house”. • “Privileges and immunity are not a gateway to claim exemptions from criminal law and that would be a betrayal to the citizens.” • “The purpose of bestowing privileges on legislators is to enable them to perform their legislative functions without hindrance or without fear or favour Legislators should act within the parameters of the public trust imposed on them to do their duties.” SOLUTIONS • ‘Parliament Disruption Index’. The idea had emerged at the conference of presiding offices of legislative bodies in Dehradun on November 2019 in the backdrop of increasing disruptions in Parliament. • Automatic suspension of members who cause disruption. 17 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES WHAT ARE THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES?  Parliament scrutinies legislative proposals (Bills) in two ways:  By discussing it on the floor of the two Houses. All bills have to be taken up for debate on the floor of the House, as a legislative requirement;  By referring a bill to a Parliamentary Committee.  A Parliamentary Committee is a committee that:  Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker/Chairman;  Works under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman;  Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman; and  Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS  In independent India, the first Public Accounts Committee was constituted in April 1950. Parliamentary committees draw their authority from:  Article 105 (on privileges of Parliament members) and,  Article 118 (on Parliament’s authority to make rules for regulating its procedure and conduct of business). 18 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish On the basis of the nature of functions performed by them, Standing Committees can be classified into 6 categories: Financial Committees • Public Accounts Committee (100 years in 2021) • Estimates Committee • Committee on Public Undertaking Departmental Standing Committees (24) Committees to Inquire • Committee on Petitions • Committee on Privileges • Ethics Committee Committees to Scrutinize and Control • Committee on Government Assurances • Committee on Subordinate Legislation • Committee on Papers Laid on the Table • Committee on Welfare of SCs and STs • Committee on Empowerment of Women • Joint Committee on Offices of Profit Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House • Business Advisory Committee • Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions • Rules Committee • Committee on Absence of Members from Sittings of the House House-Keeping or Service Committees • General Purposes Committee • House Committee • Library Committee • Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members 19 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish PURPOSE OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES  A Parliamentary committee focuses on remedying the legislative infirmity of debate on the floor of the House. Given that the House meets for less than 100 days, which does not leave enough time to discuss every Bill in detail on the floor of the House, and further, such debates are political and do not focus on the technical details of the bill.  A Parliamentary committee discharges the important function of making the administration accountable to the Parliament.  Parliamentary Committees offer:  Efficiency and transparency  Expert knowledge in law making  Inclusive participation of members from opposition  Unbiased and objective discussion above party lines  There are three broad paths by which a Bill can reach a Parliamentary Committee:  The minister introducing the Bill recommends to the House that his Bill be examined by a Select Committee (Committee of one House i.e., either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha) of the House or a Joint Committee of both Houses.  The presiding officer of the House can also send a Bill to a Parliamentary Committee.  A Bill passed by one House can be sent by the other House to its Select Committee.  A Committee’s report is recommendatory nature and is not binding on the Government. The Committee can also suggest its own version of the Bill. DATA POINTS  In the last 10 years, Parliament met for 67 days per year, on average. This is a short of amount of time for MPs to be able to get into the depth of matters being discussed in the House.  Parliament deliberates on matters that are complex, and therefore needs technical expertise to understand such matters better. Committees help with this by providing a forum where Members can engage with domain experts and government officials during their study.  For example, the Committee on Health and Family Welfare studied the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 which prohibits commercial surrogacy, but allows altruistic surrogacy. As MPs come from varying backgrounds, they may not have had the expertise to understand the details around surrogacy such as fertility issues, abortion, and regulation of surrogacy clinics, among others. The Committee called upon a range of stakeholders including the National Commission for Women, doctors, and government officials to better their understanding of the issues, before finalizing their report. 20 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Committees also provide a forum for building consensus across political parties. The proceedings of the House during sessions are televised, and MPs are likely to stick to their party positions on most matters. Committees have closed door meetings, which allows them to freely question and discuss issues and arrive at a consensus.  After a committee completes its study, it publishes its report which is laid in Parliament. These recommendations are not binding; however, they hold a lot of weight. For example, the Standing Committee on Health made several recommendations to the National Medical Commission Bill in 2017. Many of these were incorporated in the recently passed 2019 Bill, including removing the provision for allowing a bridge course for AYUSH practitioners. For example, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, overhauling the 1986 law, was recently during the previous Budget Session. An earlier version of the Bill had been examined by the Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs, which suggested several amendments such as increasing penalties for misleading advertisements, making certain definitions clearer. The government accepted most of these recommendations and incorporated them in the 2019 Act. Besides Bills, the DRSCs also examine the budget. The detailed estimates of expenditure of all ministries, called Demand for Grants are sent for examination to the DRCSs. They study the demands to examine the trends in allocations, spending by the ministries, utilization levels, and the policy priorities of each ministry. However, only a limited proportion of the budget is usually discussed on the floor of the House. In the recently dissolved16th Lok Sabha, 17% of the budget was discussed in the House. 21 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish While Committees have substantially impacted Parliament’s efficacy in discharging its roles, there is still scope for strengthening the Committee system. In the 16th Lok Sabha, DRSCs examined 41 Bills, 331 Demands for Grants, 197 issues, and published 503 Action Taken Reports. ISSUES INVOLVED  Fewer Bills referred: The ratio of bills referred to committees to bills passed is very low.  Longer tenure: The committee system allows smaller group of legislators develop technical expertise and ensure better deliberation. However, in the current system, the tenure is only one year and for any expertise to develop, a longer tenure is required.  Lack of research support: Examining bills referred to a committee requires the members of the committee to have technical expertise.  Lack of research support prevents the committees from being able to provide quality and nuanced recommendations.  Discussion of committee reports: discussions not taken up seriously as committee recommendations are not binding on financial matters such as budgets etc.  Low Attendance  Too many ministries under a committee  Norms not followed by most political parties while nominating MPs to committees 22 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish SUGGESTIONS  Strengthening committees and scrutinizing reports in a timely manner.  The discussion of committee reports in the Parliament must be encouraged.  A constitution committee can be set up to examine constitutional amendments instead of them being presented in the House as an ordinary bill.  Legislative committee of parliament to oversee and coordinate legislative planning and improving information supply.  Oversight committee to oversee effective and proper functioning of other committees  Encouraging greater public participation via various online mediums.  Formulating a defined procedure and consequences for not referring certain types of bills to parliamentary committees.  The committee system in India can be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. A quantitative study would include comparison of the number of reports submitted by each committee, number of meetings held, and the attendance of MPs for each meeting.  A qualitative study would have a higher level of subjectivity and would include studying the quality of the recommendations, level of knowledge of MPs, quality of discussions in the Committees etc. NCRWC – 2002  DRSCs should be periodically reviewed. All Bills should be referred to DRSCs. They can elicit public views and call specialist advisors. The DRSCs may finalize the second reading stage in the Committee.  Three new committees should be set up:  (a) Standing Committee on National Economy to provide analysis of the national economy with resources for advisory expertise, data gathering and research facilities;  (b) Standing Constitution Committee to scrutinize Constitutional Amendment Bills before they are introduced in Parliament; and  (c) Committee on Legislations to oversee and coordinate legislative planning. Existing Committees on Estimates, Public Undertakings and Subordinate Legislation may not be needed.

The decision will have to be approved by Parliament before coming into effect. • Article 169(1) of the Constitution allows Parliament to either create or abolish a Council if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a special majority (majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two- thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting). • The act of Parliament to create/abolish LCs is not deemed as an amendment under Article 368. So, a Simple majority in Parliament suffices. • At present, there are six states viz Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, UP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, where the Legislative Council is in existence. Jammu and Kashmir too had one, until the introduction of the J&K Reorganisation Bill, 2019 that bifurcated it into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. • Composition: • Under Article 171(1), the Legislative Council of a state shall not have more than one- third of the total strength of the State Assembly, and in no case, shall have fewer than 40 members. • Tenure of Members: • Similar to the Rajya Sabha, the legislative council is a continuing chamber, i.e. it is not subject to dissolution. The tenure of a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) is of six years, with one-third of the members retiring every two years. 27 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish COMPARISON WITH RS • The constitution hasn’t mandated LCs to shape non-financial legislation (Ordinary Bills, Constitution Amendment Bills) like it has been substantially endowed to Rajya Sabha. • Legislative Assemblies can override suggestions/amendments made to a Bill by the Council. There is no provision of a joint sitting to resolve the deadlock. • Further, Rajya Sabha MPs, are part of the electoral college related to elections for the President and Vice President whereas MLCs are not. • Also, the status accorded to Chairperson of Rajya Sabha (Ex-Officio Vice President) is starkly different vis-à-vis elected chairperson of the Legislative Council. RATIONALE FOR CREATION • India has a bicameral system vis-a-vis legislative setup. So, In the same manner, like that of Indian Parliament that has two Houses (House of the People and House of Elders), the states can also have an equivalent of Upper house i.e. Legislative Council. • Acts as a check and balance on hasty and populist actions by the directly elected House. • Facilitates diversity in the legislative process by the provision of the nomination of non- elected individuals. • It enhances the representation of local bodies in state legislation as they are given rights to elect 1/3rd of the members of the LC. CRITICISM OF STATE LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS • Superfluous and Mischievous: If a majority of the members in the upper house belong to the same party which holds the majority in the lower house, the upper house will become a mere ditto chamber. On the other hand, if two different parties are in majority, the upper house will delay the bills for months unnecessarily. Thus its role may become nasty and obstructive. • Not an Effective Check: Powers of the Legislative Councils are limited and hardly impose any effective check on the Assemblies. Whether a Bill is approved by the Council or not, the assembly can still go ahead after four months. • Vested Interests: Legislative Council serves only as a stronghold of vested interests of people, who are not interested in legislation. Instead, they may block such legislation initiated by the popularly elected Legislative Assembly. • Backdoor Entrance of the Defeated Members: Legislative Council can be utilised to accommodate discredited party-men who may not be returned to the Assemblies. • Expensive Institution: It is expensive and a big drain on the State’s exchequer 28 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish WAY FORWARD • There is a need for a National Policy on having Upper House in State Legislatures. The provision of the law for Councils to have seats for graduates and teachers should also be reviewed. • There is a need for a wide range of debates and public and intellectual opinion to have an Upper House in all state legislatures. Legislative councils should be a responsible body that can also form their part in policies and programmes for the development of states. RAJYA SABHA INTRODUCTION  Rajya Sabha’ or the ‘Council of States’ is the second chamber of the Indian parliament, which traces its origin to the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, 1919.  Rajya Sabha as the second chamber of the parliament intended to play certain roles as a permanent house (it never dissolves like Lok Sabha and one-third of its members retire every two years), revisionary house (reconsidering bills passed by the Lok Sabha) and offers a degree of continuity in the underlying policies of laws passed by parliament.  Along with this, Rajya Sabha also acts as a means to institutionalize the federal principle of power-sharing between the Centre and states.  The Rajya Sabha elections were recently concluded. Leaving aside the tussle for majority in Rajya Sabha (to get bills passed), this body has been in news for many reasons. One of the primary debate also questions the very need of an upper house.  However, the role and relevance of Rajya Sabha have been a matter of debate which can be traced from discussions in constituent assembly to recent times. BASICS  The Rajya Sabha or Council of States is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament.  It currently has a maximum membership of 245, of which 233 are elected by the legislatures of the state and union territories using single transferable votes through open ballot.  The President can appoint 12 members for their contribution to art, literature, science, and social services.  Members sit for terms lasting six years, with elections every year but almost a third of the 233 designates up for election every two years, specifically in even numbered years. 29 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONTEXT: FOR ESSAY ONLY  Historical background  The Rajya Sabha came into being on April 3, 1952 and held its first session on May 13 the same year.  The Constituent Assembly, which was formed in 1947, after the adoption of the Constitution became the Provisional Parliament and made laws till 1952.  Before its existence  The central legislature that came into being under the Government of India Act, 1919 was bicameral.  Under 1919 Act, Council of States had 60 members and Legislative Assembly had 145 members.  The membership and voting norms for the Council of States were restrictive. These restrictions meant only wealthy landowners, merchants and those with legislative experience could enter it.  Women could neither vote nor seek membership.  The Government of India Act, 1935 proposed an elaborate and improved version of the second chamber, but this never materialized. CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DEBATES REGARDING RAJYA SABHA In favor of Rajya Sabha  Proponents of the Rajya Sabha held that an upper chamber would lend a voice to the states in the legislative scheme of things and check the legislation passed in haste. Against the Rajya Sabha  The section in the constituent assembly who was opposed to the idea of Rajya Sabha held that an Upper House was not essential and opinionated that such a chamber can prove to be a “clog in the wheel of progress” of the nation, by delaying the legislative process. ELECTIONS TO THE RAJYA SABHA  Qualifications: Article 84 of the Constitution lays down the qualifications for membership of Parliament. A member of the Rajya Sabha must:  Be a citizen of India; Be at least 30 years old.(Article 84 constitution of India) 30 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Be elected by the Legislative Assembly of States and UTs by means of the single transferable vote through proportional representation.  Not be:  A proclaimed criminal,  A subject of an insolvent,  Of unsound mind.  Not hold any other office of profit under the Government of India.  Possess such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament.  In addition, twelve members are nominated by the President of India having special knowledge in various areas like arts and science. However, they are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution. ELECTION PROCEDURE  Candidates fielded by political parties have to be proposed by at least 10 members of the Assembly or 10% of the party’s strength in the House, whichever is less.  For independents, there should be 10 proposers, all of whom should be members of the Assembly.  Voting procedure  Voting is by single transferable vote, as the election is held on the principle of proportional representation.  A single transferable vote means electors can vote for any number of candidates in order of their preference.  A candidate requires a specified number of first preference votes to win. Each first- choice vote has a value of 100 in the first round.  To qualify, a candidate needs one point more than the quotient obtained by dividing the total value of the number of seats for which elections are taking place plus one.  The formula simply is [(Number of MLAs X 100) / (Vacancies + 1)] + 1.  Example: If there are four seats and 180 MLAs voting, the qualifying number will be 180/5= 36 votes or value of3,600. 31 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish Note:  The Rajya Sabha polls have a system of the open ballot, but it is a limited form of openness. There is a system of each party MLA showing his or her marked ballots to the party’s authorized agent (called Whip), before they are put into the ballot box.  The NOTA option has been struck down by the Supreme Court in RS elections. THE POWER EQUATION: LOK SABHA V/S RAJYA SABHA  The Indian Constitution provides for parity of powers between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha in law, making an exception in some cases.  The Money Bill or Finance Bills can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha which only can approve the Demands for Grants.  On the other hand, the Rajya Sabha has some special powers as requiring adopting a resolution allowing Parliament to legislate on subjects in the State List and creating All India Services, besides approving proclamations of Emergency and President’s Rule when the Lok Sabha is dissolved.  Renowned British philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill as early as in 1861 said in his great treatise Considerations on Representative Government that management of free institutions requires conciliation; a readiness to compromise; a willingness to concede something to opponents and mutual give and take. Truly, Rajya Sabha plays this role in Indian legislature. IN DETAIL: POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE RAJYA SABHA 1. Legislative Powers:  In the sphere of ordinary law-making, the Rajya Sabha enjoys equal powers with the Lok Sabha. An ordinary bill can be introduced in the Rajya Sabha and it cannot become a law unless passed by it.  In case of a deadlock between the two Houses of Parliament over an ordinary bill and if it remains unresolved for six months, the President can convene a joint sitting of the two Houses for resolving the deadlock.  This joint sitting is presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. But if the deadlock is not resolved, the bill is deemed to have been killed. 2. Financial Powers:  In the financial sphere, the Rajya Sabha is a weak house.  A money bill cannot be introduced in the Rajya Sabha. It can be initiated only in the Lok Sabha. 32 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  A money bill passed by the Lok Sabha comes before the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. 3. Executive Powers:  Members of the Rajya Sabha can exercise some control over the ministers by criticizing their policies, by asking questions and moving motions, etc.  Some of the ministers are also taken from the Rajya Sabha. The PM can also be from Rajya Sabha if the majority party in the Lok Sabha may elect/adopt him as its leader. 4. Electoral Powers:  The Rajya Sabha has some electoral powers also. The elected members of the Rajya Sabha along with the elected members of the Lok Sabha and all the State Legislative Assemblies together elect the President of India.  The members of the Rajya Sabha Lok Sabha together elect the Vice- President of India.  Members of the Rajya Sabha also elect a Deputy Chairman from amongst themselves. 5. Judicial Powers:  The RS acting along with the Lok Sabha can impeach the President on changes of violation of the constitution.  The RS can also pass a special address for causing the removal of a judge of the Supreme court or of any High court.  The charges against the Vice-President can be levelled only in the RS.  The RS can pass a resolution for the removal of some high officers like the Attorney General of India, CAG, and Chief Election Commissioner. 6. Exclusive Powers: The Rajya Sabha enjoys two exclusive powers: (i) The Power to declare a subject of State List as a subject of National Importance:  The Rajya Sabha can pass a resolution by 2/3rd majority of its members for declaring a State List subject as a subject of national importance.  Such a resolution empowers the Union Parliament to legislate on such a state subject for a period of one year. Such resolutions can be repeatedly passed by the Rajya Sabha. (ii) Power in respect of Creation or Abolition of an All-India Service: 33 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  The Rajya Sabha has the power to create one or more new All India Services. It can do so by passing a resolution supported by 2/3rd majority on the plea of national interest.  In a similar way, the Rajya Sabha can disband an existing All India Service. 7. Miscellaneous Powers: The RS and LS jointly perform the following functions:  Approval of the ordinances issued by the President.  Ratification of an emergency proclamation  Making any change in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts  Making any change in the qualification for the membership of the LS and the RS. ROLE OF RAJYA SABHA  Safety Valve of India’s Federal Polity: Bicameralism is necessary for a federal constitution to give representation to the units of the federation.  While checks and balances usually operate between the executive, legislature and judiciary, the Council of States acts as a safety valve within the legislature itself, easing federal tensions.  Rajya Sabha thus represents a crucial component of the constitutional checks and balances scheme, in addition to the commonly identified examples of responsible government and judicial review.  Review and Revaluation Role: Indian constitution framers wanted to create a house that would act as a revisionary house to keep a check on the hasty legislation that could be passed by the lower house under populist pressures.  Also, when the ruling dispensation has a brute majority in the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha can prevent the government of the day exercising authoritarianism.  A Deliberative Body: Parliament is not only a legislative body but also a deliberative one which enables the members ty debate major issues of public importance. Thus, the role of the Upper House is to be a deliberative body besides balancing the “fickleness and passion” of the Lok Sabha.  Representing the Vulnerable Sections:  Women, religious, ethnic and linguistic minority groups are not adequately represented in the Lok Sabha (due to first past the post-election system).  An indirect form of election (through propositional representation) to the Rajya Sabha, therefore, would give them a chance to get involved in the nation’s law-making process. 34 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Thus, Rajya Sabha can make a place for people who may not be able to win a popular mandate. SPECIAL POWERS OF RAJYA SABHA The Upper House also has some special powers, such as:  Power to transfer a subject from the State List to Union List for a specified period (Article 249).  To create additional All-India Services (Article 312).  To endorse Emergency under Article 352 for a limited period when the Lok Sabha remains dissolved.  According to President Radha Krishnan, there are functions, which a revising chamber like Rajya Sabha can fulfil fruit fully. Parliament is not only a legislative but a deliberative body. So far as its deliberative functions are concerned, Rajya Sabha has made very valuable contributions time and again. It’s true that party dynamics affects the working of Rajya Sabha. But in democracy passion often defeat the normal rationality. Thus, a revising house is needed to check such adrenal rush.  While the argument of members not able to win in direct elections holds true, but retaining talent is essential for any democratic system. Losing valuable talent during election fervors has mostly been corrected by Rajya Sabha. It has also given entry to other experts like scientist, artist, sportsmen etc that can rarely face the electoral politics. While Lok Sabha have members for each state, the Hindi belt domination is a constant theme. Hence other state interests, like those in Northeast, have always been taken up by the Rajya Sabha. While it can’t bring no confidence motion or amend money bill, its role in checking arbitrariness of government, as reflected in Land Ordinance, is necessary in democracy. Besides its special role in All India Services, legislation in State List too necessitates its existence. Men and women of prodigious talent and caliber have adorned the benches of the upper house and have contributed significantly towards realizing the vision of the founding fathers of the Constitution.  A permanent Upper House is also a check against any abrupt changes in the composition of the Lower House. Rajya Sabha has continuity and is a permanent house. Unlike Lok Sabha, it cannot be dissolved by anyone. Thus, it has, time and often, carried out some administrative functions even when the lower house is dissolved. It has members with experienced players while there may be new entrants in the Lok Sabha. By virtue of this, Rajya Sabha can’t be said to be ‘obstructive’. 35 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish ISSUES RELATED TO RAJYA SABHA  No equal Representation of states  Federal countries like US, Australia, institutionalize the principle of federalism more strongly than India, by providing equal representation to all states in their upper houses.  This is in contrast with the Rajya Sabha, where states are represented proportionally to their relative populations.  For example, the number of seats allocated in Rajya Sabha to Uttar Pradesh alone is significantly higher than that of combined north-eastern states.  Bypassing the Rajya Sabha:  In some cases, ordinary bills are being passed in the form of a Money Bill, circumventing the Rajya Sabha and giving rise to the question about the very efficacy of the upper house of Parliament. This can be seen recently in the controversy related to Aadhar Act.  Undermining of Federal character of Rajya Sabha  By way of the Representation of People (Amendment) Act, 2003, parliament has removed the word ‘domicile’ from Section 3 of Representation of People Act, 1951.  This essentially means that a person who does not belong to a state can contest the Rajya Sabha elections from that state of which they are neither a resident nor a domicile.  After the amendment, the seats in the Rajya Sabha have been used by the ruling party to get their defeated candidate in Lok Sabha, elected in Rajya Sabha.  Low Participation of Nominated Members  More recently, the sincerity of nominated members has been questioned in multiple instances.  Nominations are made by the government to satisfy the sentiments of the followers of certain personalities.  Once nominated, they rarely participate in the working of the house. Sachin Tendulkar was appointed in 2012 and the House has met 374 days since then, but the attendance of Sachin Tendulkar is a meagre 24 days. 36 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish MONEY BILLS  A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha by a minister and only on recommendation of President of India.  When the Lok Sabha passes a money bill then the Lok Sabha sends money bill to the Rajya Sabha for 14 days during which it can make recommendations.  Even if Rajya Sabha fails to return the money bill in 14 days to the Lok Sabha, that bill is deemed to have passed by both the Houses.  Also, if the Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed. Hence, Rajya Sabha can only give recommendations for a money bill but Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill.  There is no joint sitting of both the houses with respect to money bills, because all final decisions are taken by the Lok Sabha  Joint Sitting of the Parliament : Article 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases. Considering that the numerical strength of Lok Sabha is more than twice that of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Joint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened only three times in last 71 years, for the purpose of passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:  1961: Dowry Prohibition Act, 1958  1978: Banking Services Commission (Repeal) Act, 1977  2002: Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002  No confidence motion: The Union Council of Ministers is collectively responsible before the Lok Sabha and not the Rajya Sabha. Lok Sabha alone can cause the fall of the Council of Ministers by passing a vote of no-confidence STEPS TO BE TAKEN  To preserve the federal character of Rajya Sabha, one step would be to have members of the Rajya Sabha be directly elected by the citizens of a state.  This will reduce cronyism and patronage appointments.  Also, a federal arrangement can be devised to enable equal representation for each state, so that large states do not dominate the proceedings in the House.  There is a need for a better procedure of nomination to improve the quality of discussion in the House.  A cue in this regard can be taken from the UK. 37 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  The House of Lords Act, 1999 has led to the introduction of the Appointments Commission in 2000 with the primary function of making recommendations for the appointment of non-party-political members to the House of Lords.  This commission can recommend nomination to Rajya Sabha from groups under - represented. CONCLUSION  Even though the ups and downs of Indian politics, the Rajya Sabha has remained a vanguard for political and social values, a melting pot of cultural diversity. Also, along with Lok Sabha, it is a flag-bearer of the sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic called India.  Thus, Rajya Sabha should not be seen as a ‘disruptive’ wing of the legislation and efforts should be made to enable Rajya Sabha to retain its significant role in Indian democracy.  A study of the powers of the Rajya Sabha leads us to the conclusion that it is neither a very weak house like the British House of Lords nor a very powerful house as the American Senate. Its position is somewhat mid-way between the two. It has been less powerful than Lok Sabha, but it has been not a very weak or insignificant House.  Instead of engaging in the debate of if we need upper house or not, more constructive outlook would improve its functioning. Clearly, the recommendations are present from NCRWC to 2nd ARC. The need is implementation and political support.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
