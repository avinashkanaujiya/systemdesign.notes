Mainstreaming Transgender Community Introduction • The recent Starbucks India’s ad campaign ‘#ItStartsWithYourName’ brought into focus a taboo society has against the transgender community. Transgender • ‘Transgender’ refers to individuals who do not identify with the binary gender system of male and female. • The transgender existence dates back centuries in India, with its history of recognition in ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts. • India’s legal recognition of the third gender was a significant step. • In 2014, the Supreme Court recognized the third gender as a legal category. Mainstreaming Transgender Community • Mainstreaming involves creating a society that is inclusive and supportive of them. • Policies and programmes that ensure their socio-economic and political empowerment will be needed. • Awareness creation among people in general. • Governments also need to address the discrimination and stigma faced by the community. State Government initiatives • Kerala became the first in India to introduce a transgender policy in 2015. o It provides for the creation of a transgender justice board, the only one of its kind. o It also includes provisions for education, employment and healthcare. • In 2018, Tamil Nadu announced a scheme offering free sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to transgenders, apart from education and job opportunities. Private initiatives • Tata Steel and Indian Oil Corp took initiatives to create inclusive workplaces for transgenders. • Both recruited transgender trainee engineers and offered education and skill development. Global initiatives • In 2007, Nepal became the world’s first country to recognize a third gender category on its citizenship certificates. • Sweden is the most LGBTQ-friendly country of all. • Canada has passed a transgender rights bill that offers legal protections and prohibits discrimination. • Among global enterprises, Starbucks is one of the largest to create an inclusive workplace for transgender employees. Concerns / Challenges • Discrimination in education and employment, resulting in economic marginalization and poverty. • The healthcare needs of the community also suffer. • Religious and cultural beliefs, resulting in many being shunned by their families. • Violence against transgenders. Many face this routinely, causing fear and insecurity. Way Forward • Governments must take a proactive approach and work with civil society, NGOs, businesses and other stakeholders to help draw the third gender into the mainstream. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 3 • Access to affordable and gender-affirming healthcare services. • The Skill India Mission could provide the opportunities and enable transgenders to enter the workforce. What transgender community can do • Demand reservations in politics, public office and employment. • Join together under LGBTQ+ banners and hold events for awareness. • Create a website and social media presence for the community and publicize issues and activities. • At the workplace, help employers develop awareness modules for staff on respecting and dealing with transgenders. 2. India’s Demographic Dividend Introduction • Political leaders, businessmen, and economic commentators started talking about India’s demographic dividend at least a decade ago. • But typically, much of the discussions have focused on narrow parameters, specifically the proportion of the dependent population to the working age population. Demographic Dividend • If a large proportion of a country’s population is in the working age group, the added productivity of this group can provide a “demographic dividend” of economic growth. • The demographic dividend doesn’t last forever. • Countries need to reap the benefits of the demographic dividends before the working age population becomes smaller than the dependent population. India’s Demographic Dividend • India has surpassed China to become the world’s most populous country, according to the latest UN data. • As much as 68 percent of the working or able-to-work population certainly looks like a demographic dividend. • India’s demographic dividend can boost India's GDP growth — from the current $3 trillion to $9 trillion by 2030 and $40 trillion by 2047. • 2020-50 provides India with a short window of opportunity to harness its demographic dividend. • India can leverage its demographic dividend to attract big businesses from Western countries which had chosen China for manufacturing. India’s dependency ratio • India’s dependency ratio fell below 50% by 2020. • Much will depend on the fall in the fertility rate, the mortality rate and the life expectancy of the population over the next couple of decades. • India’s demographic dividend conversations have focused too much on the dependency ratio and not enough on the policies and other factors. • Apart from allowing private sector participation, our healthcare, education, labour and trade policies did not really keep up with what was required. • The Union as well as the state governments did not devote the resources that were needed. • Nor did we pay enough focused attention to trade or labour flexibility policies. Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) • Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) looks at the number of people within the working age population who are willing to work. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 4 • The unemployment rate looks at the people who have failed to find employment despite being willing to work. • Less than 50% of our working age population is actively looking for work in India. • Multiple factors have led to the current conditions in LFPR and unemployment in India. • Education – Employment opportunity mismatch is one. • Many companies, particularly engineering companies, are dissatisfied with the lack of candidates who meet their minimum requirements in terms of knowledge even if they have the requisite degrees. • This is the issue, even in manual labour that requires skills. • The revolution in technology—especially digital technology—as well as formalisation taking place in a number of sectors, is another major issue. • Automation and robotics are reducing the role of manual and even white-collared labour in low knowledge jobs. • Formalisation has also reduced the number of jobs available to the labour pool. • Consolidation taking place in sectors also reduces the need for labour in the entire sector. • These trends will only accelerate in the future. And that is why the demographic dividend debate needs to expand. Way Forward • India can reap a dividend and grow consistently at more than 8% for at least two and a half decades. • The right policies are needed in four areas o public health o family planning o education and o economic policies that promote labour market flexibility, openness to trade, and savings. • All these policies need to be in place well before the demographic bulge in working age population takes place. • The private sector will play a critical role in improving the employment situation in India. • The private sector can collaborate with the government to offer internships, apprenticeships, and other skill development initiatives. 3. Battle Against Child Labour Introduction • Around 10.1 million children in India work in various forms of labour, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates. • This perpetuates the vicious cycle of poverty and denying children their fundamental rights. • Therefore, it is crucial to shed light on the plight of child labourers in India. Child Labour in India • The latest National Sample Survey reveals alarming rates of child labour in numerous states. • Uttar Pradesh leads with an estimated 2.1 million child labourers. • The agriculture sector accounts for 70 per cent of child labour. • Nearly 28 per cent of children aged 5-11 years and 35 per cent of children aged 12-14 years involved in child labour are out of school. • Child labour is more prevalent among boys than girls at every age. • The prevalence of child labour in rural areas is close to three times higher than in urban areas. • Covid has put children at risk of child labour. Impact / Consequences • Engaging in hazardous work exposes these children to risks of injuries, health complications and long-term developmental issues. • The emotional scars run deep, leaving them with anxiety, trauma and a sense of hopelessness. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 5 • Child labour restricts education and perpetuates poverty cycles. Government Initiatives • Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 aims to strengthen the protection of children from exploitation. • Linking the age of the prohibition of employment with the age for free and compulsory education under Right to Education Act, 2009 • Civil society organisations and grassroots movements have also played a vital role in rescuing child labourers and advocating for their rights. Role of ILO • ILO has been at the forefront of the global fight against child labour. • ILO provides technical assistance and promotes international standards to eradicate this issue. • ILO facilitates dialogue and cooperation to address labour challenges by bringing together representatives of workers, employers and governments. Way Forward • Advocate for stronger policies, raise public awareness, and provide support to eradicate child labour. • Address the root causes, such as poverty, lack of education and weak enforcement of labour laws. • Empower children with the knowledge and skills they need to break free from the clutches of labour. • District and local administrations have to take proactive steps to ensure post rescue rehabilitation. Conclusion • We must create a society where no child is left behind by providing social protection and fostering an environment conducive to education. General Studies – 2 Topic: Statutory, regulatory and various quasi-judicial bodies 4. Tribunals in India Introduction • Tribunal is a quasi-judicial institution that is set up to resolve administrative or tax-related disputes. • Part XIV-A of the Constitution which consist of two articles 323A and 323B deals with Tribunals. Tribunals and their mandate • The original Constitution did not contain provisions with respect to tribunals. • The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added a new Part XIV- A to the Constitution. • This part consists of only two Articles–Article 323 A dealing with administrative tribunals and Article 323 B dealing with tribunals for other matters. Tribunals and judicial efficiency • Tribunals goes by the principle of natural justice. • Its procedures are simple and can be easily understood by a layman. • They take a load off the already overburdened courts. • They hear disputes related to the environment, armed forces, tax and administrative issues. • Administrative tribunals have become the most appropriated means of administrative action. Constraints faced by tribunals in India INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 6 • The manner of appointment of its members, performance appraisal, remuneration, terms of service, are all outside the oversight of the judiciary. • Executive interference in the functioning of tribunals is often seen in matters of appointment and removal of tribunal members, as well as day-to-day functioning of the tribunals. • Administrative tribunals, with their separate laws and procedures often made by themselves, puts a limitation upon the principles of Rule of Law. • Most of the tribunals do not enjoy the same amount of independence of the Executive as do the Courts and the judges. • Rising number of vacancies in various law tribunals across the country. • Administrative tribunals are manned by administrators and technical heads who may not have the background of law or training of judicial work. • In Chandra Kumar case, SC held that the appeals to tribunals lies before the court and hence defeats the whole purpose of reducing burden of the superior courts. • Since the tribunals are mainly chaired by the retired judges, the present judges in courts may favour government in certain matter to gain appointment to such tribunals after retirement. • Lack of adequate infrastructure to work smoothly and perform the functions originally envisioned. National tribunal commission – a way forward • The idea of an NTC was first mooted by the Supreme Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997). • NTC is envisaged to be an independent umbrella body to supervise the functioning of tribunals, and to take care of administrative and infrastructural needs of the tribunals. • The NTC could pave the way for the separation of the administrative and judicial functions carried out by various tribunals. • NTC could function as an independent recruitment body to operationalise the procedure for disciplinary proceedings and appointment of tribunal members. • The independence of tribunals was described as a fundamental feature of the Indian Constitution in the case of Rojer Mathew’s decision. • This fundamental feature must be encapsulated and maintained in reality through the creation of the NTC. Topic: Issues relating to development and management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health, Education, Human Resources. 5. The dream of a healthy nation Introduction • To meet India’s healthcare challenges and transform it into a world leader in the field in the next 25 years, we must act now to transform education, expand care and research. Present challenges • These include climate change, the rising aspirations of people, inequitable access to resources and the biggest challenge of all: Health. • India is predicted to be the capital of non-communicable diseases, cancers and deaths due to trauma. • The challenges are humongous due to the huge population of 1.4 billion, along with inadequate public health system and the huge difference between the haves and have-nots. • India@100 will have addressed all the challenges humanely, efficiently and adequately. Overcoming Challenges in Medical education • The most critical challenge is the mushrooming of medical, nursing and AYUSH colleges, and non- availability of dedicated faculty. • We can overcome this by using digital technology to reach the unreached students quickly and effectively. • Align medical education to India’s healthcare needs through integrated courses and creating a bigger and better pool of paramedical and nursing personnel on priority. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 7 • The district residency programme can be expanded to provide district PG programmes with adjunct faculty from the public hospitals. • This will improve the quality of care and also meet the aspirations of the students. • India with its huge and young population can become a provider of healthcare personnel to the world. • Today there is blurring of the line between engineering and medicine. • While engineering and science institutions are setting up medical colleges, medical universities can effectively utilise data science, computing tools and inputs from design schools to improve on innovations and find solutions. Promoting Research • Research will slowly move out of the laboratories to the bedside. • Reserving most of the available funds for life science research towards finding solutions for the health problems of the country. • With good infrastructure and capacity building, India@100 will have Nobel Prize-winning scientists. Clinical and primary care • Most clinical, preventive and primary care will be taken over by technology-based solutions and paramedical personnel. • Clinicians will need to be trained to provide secondary and tertiary care. • India@100 will ensure equitable and the best healthcare to every citizen of the world. Way Forward • The need of the day is a revolution to make India a world leader in health. • Provided we act now, the next 25 years will witness a big change in the health indices. • We need to collaborate and work together as a society and as a polity. • The silos of medical education in colleges, life science research in laboratories and public health in government hospitals will need to be integrated and work in close collaboration, with linkages through NEP 2020, National Digital Health Mission. • India@100 will then see a smoothly oiled machine where public health drives education and research. 6. Childhood Malnutrition Introduction • Persistently high rates of childhood undernutrition were reported by the last National Family Health Survey. • It reported prevalence of 35.5% stunting, 32.1% underweight and 19.3% wasting in children under five years of age. Susceptibility of Undernourished children • Undernourished children are highly susceptible to serious infections because of poor immunity. • They are physically inactive because of low muscle mass and reduced lung capacity. • They suffer cognitive impairment, which diminishes their potential for education and employment. • This adversely affects the country’s economic development by undermining the demographic dividend. • Such children are also more likely to suffer early onset diabetes and cardiovascular disease as they grow. Nutrition supplementation • Inappropriate nutrition supplementation can have adverse consequences. • Study show that children who receive poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood are likely to remain shorter even as their weight increases. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 8 • Calorie intake in later childhood, mostly leads to weight gain in the form of body fat rather than lean muscle. • Experts caution that nutrition supplementation for hastening ‘catch-up growth’ in previously undernourished children would be counterproductive. Dangers of ‘rebound adiposity’ • There are dangers of ‘rebound adiposity’, where increased dietary intake gets converted to fat that sparks inflammation in the body. • Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are especially undesirable because they provide the wrong proportion of nutrients. • The gut bacteria (microbiome), which thrive on dietary fibre and keep us healthy, cannot thrive on such foods. Way Forward • We need to prevent childhood malnutrition by promoting adequate and appropriate nutrition for the girl child, pregnant woman and lactating mother. • We need sound infant feeding practices, with emphasis on breastfeeding. • The growing child needs a balanced diet, with good quality proteins, fruits and vegetables, millets, unrefined fibre-rich grains, and healthy, unsaturated fats. • Such healthy diets must be coupled with adequate exercise through active sports and yoga. • We need to proactively build healthier, stronger, more muscular and agile children. • We need a coherent policy response which o steers agriculture and food systems towards production and supply of healthier foods at affordable prices, o regulation of unhealthy foods (especially UPF) through raised taxes and curbed advertising, o improving the composition and quality of pre-school and school meals, and o promotion of physical activity in an engaging manner for all children. • Poverty reduction is important to make healthier diets more affordable. • If we do not do all of this, our children will not grow to their full potential, neither physically nor mentally. • If we accept an adiposity-dominated body composition as the Indian norm, we cannot meet Swami Vivekananda’s call to develop youth who have “muscles of iron, nerves of steel, inside which dwells a mind of the same material as that of which the thunderbolt is made”. 7. How India’s G20 presidency can address global hunger Introduction • For the first time in decades, there is a rising number of hungry people, even though we produce enough food. • Today, more than 800 million people go to bed hungry. • Many of them are small-scale farmers who produce one-third of the world’s food. Hunger in Rural Areas • Three-fourths of the world’s poorest and food insecure live in rural areas. • Rural economies have suffered from chronic under-investment. • Both governments and companies need to focus on Investing in rural agriculture. • Boosting local production, local food chains and local markets means global food security, jobs and less conflict. • For the private sector, investing in small-scale farmers is a win-win: Production costs are low, returns on capital are high. • Investing in agriculture is at least 2-3 times more effective in reducing poverty than investment in other sectors. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 9 Concerns / Challenges • It is challenging for low- and middle-income countries to finance their development and climate action. • Small-scale producers still lack access to credit, markets, technology, infrastructure, information and land. • Disruptions in global food production and distribution systems, triggered by Covid-19 and further accentuated by Ukrainian-Russian conflict. Role of India’s G-20 presidency • India’s G-20 presidency assumes critical importance to ensure that every person has access to affordable, safe, sufficient and nutritious food. • India is a crucial partner in the mission to end rural poverty and hunger. • Through panchayat system, India has built robust community institutions that have strengthened people’s ability to manage their own development. • The G-20 can set the course for structural change, mobilising commitments from governments and global financial institutions to invest in medium-term sustainable rural development and agriculture. • Indian presidency can deliver feasible roadmap for inclusive, resilient and sustainable food systems. • This will end hunger for 800 million people, create over 120 million decent rural jobs, boost incomes for the bottom 20 per cent and combat climate change. Way Forward • Investments through innovative financial instruments can help agriculture become the centre of growth. • Multilateral development banks and international financial institutions like the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) can make a big difference. • Increasing digitisation, making insurance attractive for farmers, providing access to easy loans, securing land rights and strengthening farmers’ organisations. • Depoliticising the global supply of food, fertilisers and medical products, so that geopolitical tensions do not lead to humanitarian crises. 8. Higher Education System Introduction • The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) recently released the India Rankings for 2023. • There are criticisms on the methodology adopted and the parameters chosen by the Ministry of Education. NIRF methodology • Rankings of higher education institutions in five categories — overall, universities, colleges, research institutions, and innovation. • Eight subject domains — engineering, management, pharmacy, medical, dental, law, architecture and planning, and agriculture and allied sectors. • The NIRF evaluates institutions on five parameters: teaching, learning and resources; graduation outcome; research and professional practices; outreach and inclusivity; and perception. • Ranks are assigned based on the sum of marks secured by institutions on each of these parameters. Some issues • The first is the issue of participation of institutions. o In the 2023 edition only 12.3% of higher educational institutions participated in the ranking process. o The list of top 100 colleges shows scant presence of colleges from rural areas. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 10 o The lack of participation of institutions from rural areas raises questions on the urban bias of the ranking framework. • The second issue is the incongruence between quantity and quality. o 81% of high-quality colleges are in three States. o This highlights the need for a mission to improve quality across the country. o There is a tremendous scope for more State universities to figure in this list. o If the quality of State universities is enhanced, it would serve the purpose of serving students in rural locations. • The third issue stems from the close correlation between faculty strength and rankings. o A comparison between the top 100 and remaining institutions shows vast differences in this regard. • Social aspects and social justice aspect are completely missing. • Despite increasing education costs, the NIRF does not make any mention of individual fees as a metric for evaluating institutes. Concerns / Challenges • Quality differences are evident between private and government institutions. • Budget constraints of Indian universities. • India’s share in the overall world scientific publications is about 4.81%, whereas for chins it was 26% in 2018. • Lack of synergy between industry and tech training institutes. • A number of surveys have highlighted that only one in five engineering graduates in the country has the state-of-the-art skills required in today’s job market. • There is a dominant ideology of commercialisation of knowledge and teaching. Way Forward • The rankings underscore the urgent need for quality enhancement in the higher education system. • Budgetary outlays for higher education need a quantum jump in India. • Resolving India’s skill crisis requires private and public agents to show willingness to engage with the faculty in small cities and towns. • Broaden the scope of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) and Open and Distance Learning (ODL) to provide access to quality education beyond geographical boundaries. • Safeguard the interests of thousands of temporary faculty members by expediting the permanent appointments in a time-bound framework and transparent manner. • Each state must establish an integrated higher education master plan to provide an excellent education for all its residents. Topic: Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests. 9. India and Egypt Relations Introduction • Historically, India-Egypt ties are perhaps the oldest civilisational link. • This historic inspiration needs to be invoked while aiming for greater bilateral relevance and substantiality. Historical, Cultural and Diplomatic Exchanges • India and Egypt shared a crucial diplomatic relation since 3rd century BC. • During that era, Indian Emperor Ashoka dispatched his envoys to the court of the Egyptian ruler Ptolemy II Philadelphus. • The Egyptian king dispatched his own ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court at Patliputra. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 11 • This incident marks the earliest known interaction between the two ancient civilizations, laying the foundation of diplomatic engagement between India and Egypt. Background • Delhi established a bilateral relationship with Cairo just three days after it got Independence on August 15, 1947. • Both countries played a pivotal role in founding the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Recent Agreements Signed • Many agreements were signed during the Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Egypt. • First, was the signature on the strategic partnership between India and Egypt. • Three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) in the fields of agriculture, archaeology and antiquities, and competition law were also signed Bilateral Relations • The past century of contacts produced plenty of goodwill — from decolonisation to non-alignment and Egyptians’ Bollywood-frenzy. • India’s trade with the most populous Arab country stood at $6,061 million in 2022-23. • India was Egypt’s sixth largest trading partner, while Egypt was India’s 38th. • Indian investments in Egypt were spread over 50 projects totalling $3.15 billion. • For many years there have been joint exercises and training programmes in the defence sector. Opportunities for India • The socio-economic conditions of Egypt are quite similar to India. • Egypt’s largest imports are refined petroleum, wheat, cars, corn and pharmaceuticals — all of which India has the potential to supply. • The Egyptian government has an ambitious infrastructure development agenda. • During 2015-19, Egypt was the world’s third-largest arms importer. • Egypt is located at a crucial geo-strategic location — 12 per cent of global trade passes through the Suez Canal. • These present opportunities for India. Areas of Collaboration • Green and renewable collaboration will be important because of the importance that the two sides attach to clean energy. • The newly formed ‘India Unit’ in the Egyptian Cabinet will be a “useful tool in steering bilateral collaborations Concerns / Challenges • The Egyptian economy is in a serious crisis. • Annual inflation is above 30% and the currency has lost more than half its value since February 2022. • Foreign exchange scarcity has forced the deferral of payments for such essentials as wheat. Conclusion • As India and Egypt continue to strengthen their relationship, the potential for further growth and diversification becomes increasingly promising, fostering cooperation in the years to come. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 12 Topic: Important International institutions, agencies and fora- their structure, mandate. 10. WTO Reforms Introduction • WTO assumes a vital role in ensuring fairness and transparency in global trade. • Recent meeting of the G20 working group on trade and investment focused on the important issue of WTO reform. • However, any talk of WTO reform should not lose sight of the larger global context. Background • More than 50 years ago, the world valued economic interdependence with the belief that it would deter security confrontation. • WTO was aimed at legalising and policing economic interdependence. Present Status • Today’s world is dominated by geoeconomic considerations and securitisation of international economic relations. • Unilateralism in international economic relations, especially by developed countries like the US, is on the rise. • Economic policies such as industrial subsidies and local content requirements have made a comeback. • There is a deliberate effort to weaken trade multilateralism. Need for WTO reforms • WTO reform is needed to prevent that power replaces rules in global trade relations. • The special and differential treatment (SDT) give special rights to developing countries and obligate developed countries to treat the former more favourably. • However, only 21 per cent of the SDT provisions in various WTO agreements oblige developed countries to provide differential treatment. • The appellate body — the WTO’s dispute settlement body — remains paralysed since 2019 because of the US’s lack of concern. • Slowness of the consensus-based decision-making in the WTO. • There is a shift towards plurilateral discussions on select issues such as investment facilitation. • Although WTO member countries are obliged to notify all their laws and regulations that affect trade, compliance with this obligation is poor. Role of G20 • G20 countries are interested in reforming the WTO for the better. • G20 countries need to either persuade the US to change its position or bring to light the appellate body without the US. • India, under its Presidency of the G20, should work with others to drive the WTO reforms agenda aimed at making trade multilateralism inclusive. Way Forward • Reaffirming WTO’s foundational principles, as embodied in the Marrakesh Agreement. • This governance framework should include key principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and inclusivity. • Having a fully functioning dispute settlement system should be a top priority. • Countries must use all available WTO tools to anchor their own reforms to improve their business. • WTO members must do more to expand the role of trade as a tool to create jobs, reduce poverty and increase economic opportunity. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 13 11. Reforming Multilateral Development Banks Introduction • In recent years, the restructuring of MDBs has received increasing attention. • In his address to the US Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the relevance of MDBs and the need to reform them. Background • At the end of WWII, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and reconstruction. • This led to the creation of the IMF and World Bank Group (WBG). • The World Bank Group was responsible for providing financial assistance for the post-war reconstruction and economic development of the less developed countries. • While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB, over the years, several other MDBs and regional development banks (RDBs) have emerged. Relevance • MDBs have remained relevant as credible institutions to support the development of both low-and middle-income countries. • It is believed that these institutions are no longer suited in terms of the resources and methods to address the emerging challenges. • Given their technical knowledge, experience and credibility in the financial sphere, they need to rediscover their role. • The two traditional goals shared by all multilateral institutions have been the elimination of poverty and fostering shared prosperity. Concerns / Challenges • The new challenge is to broaden the mandate and vision to address the challenges of transboundary issues. • Ability of MDBs to finance for larger goals like addressing poverty and inequality without reducing development financing. • The current system has failed to raise sufficient private finance. Way Forward • While broadening the mandate of MDBs is imperative, it should not be at the cost of available funding for addressing poverty and inequality. • The MDBs need to optimise their current balance sheets to create higher leverage from existing funds. • There is a need to mobilise private capital. • Need for bringing changes to the current operating model of the MDBs. • For India, reforming MDBs would mean advocating the voice of the Global South. • Making MDBs more relevant for addressing 21st-century challenges would contribute towards enhancing human welfare.

Role of States in India’s Energy Transition Introduction • India’s global climate pledges are backed by domestic energy targets. • States are critical actors in India’s energy transition as there is a multi-tier governance of energy production and usage. Energy transition • India aims to reduce the overall carbon intensity and achieve 50 per cent of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. • The diversity of India’s States will determine its domestic energy transition. • An effective transition will require bridging the implementation gaps between the Centre and the States. Present Status • Solar, wind, and other renewable energy (RE) sources are already replacing the historic share of coal and gas in the power generation mix. • India’s achievements on its 2022 target for 175 GW renewable energy offer some insights. • Only Gujarat, Karnataka, and Rajasthan met their individual targets. • About 80% of the current renewable energy capacity is confined to Six states. Why States matter • States as spheres of implementation are critical to the realisation of national targets. • Early initiatives by Gujarat and Rajasthan on solar, and Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu on wind energy technologies, have contributed to renewable energy uptake at the national level. • PM KUSUM is an adoption of successful State experiments on the solarisation of agriculture at a national scale. Way Forward • Need for a State-level framework to understand plans, actions, and governance processes towards an energy transition. • Update the State Action Plans on Climate Change. • Set up State-level steering committees for energy transitions. • Regular meetings of the Central and state energy ministers reinforce the importance of States. • Need for analysis of State-level preparedness for energy transition. • Issues in the electricity sector, such as high losses, unreliable supply and service quality, must be addressed. • State energy departments also need to strengthen electricity infrastructure for better integration of renewables. Conclusion • Electricity is a concurrent subject and despite the national focus, each state has to come forward and devise its own plan and road map to meet the 2030 clean energy goals.

India’s Port Development Introduction • India has moved up to 22nd rank in the global rankings on the “International Shipments” category. • The reason behind this performance is the reduction in the dwell time (the amount of time vessels spend in port actively loading or unloading cargo). • India has also done well in port operational efficiency. • This achievement is due to large investments in the upgradation of infrastructure in the ports and shipping sector. Recent Developments • There has been a consistent focus on improvements in port efficiency and productivity through o reforms, o induction of new technologies, o a greater thrust on public-private partnership and o overall commitment to the ease of doing business. • The total capacity of Indian ports has gone up from about 1,560 MMT in 2015 to more than 2,600 MMT. • The efficiency of ports has received a boost with the launch of the National Logistics Portal (Marine), a single-window digital platform for all stakeholders. • The Sagar Setu app facilitates seamless movement of goods and services in ports while substantially enhancing the ease of doing business. • India and Indonesia have completed a joint feasibility study on developing the strategically valuable Sabang port. Focus on decarbonisation • There has been a 14-fold increase in the use of renewable energy in major ports over the last eight years. • Four of the major ports generate more renewable energy than their total energy needs. • The Harit Sagar Green Port guidelines aims to bring a paradigm shift towards safe, efficient and sustainable ports. Policy and legislative reforms • The Centre has also undertaken several key policy and legislative reforms to boost the port sector. • Major Port Authorities Act, 2021 grants greater autonomy to major ports. • The Marine Aids to Navigation Act, 2021 provides for increased safety and efficiency in vessel traffic services. • The Indian Vessels Act, 2021 brings uniformity in law and standardised provisions across all inland waterways in the country. • The government has endeavoured to develop ports as hubs of economic activity. • Sagarmala Programme to modernise our ports. Way Forward • Overall capacity augmentation of Indian ports should be done. • Major ports should consider suitable reduction in vessel related charges and make them at par with the charges prevailing in neighbouring foreign ports. • The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways should expeditiously resolve issues like clearances related to land acquisition, CRZ clearances etc, so that the execution of Sagarmala projects is expedited. Conclusion INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 16 • The operational efficiencies of Indian ports and the Indian maritime sector is an important step in India’s endeavour to become a global maritime power as envisaged in the Maritime India Vision, 2030.

Climate Smart Agriculture Introduction • FAO defines Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) as “agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience, reduces/removes GHGs where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security”. • Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach for transforming agricultural production systems so that they support sustainable development and can ensure food security under climate change. India’s vulnerability • India’s agricultural is highly monsoon dependent and with 85% small and marginal landholdings, it is highly sensitive to weather abnormalities. • The Economic Survey 2021-22 points out that the country is over-exploiting its ground water resource. • There are reports of heat waves, which in turn affects crops, aquatic systems and livestock. • There will be an increased risk of pests and diseases due to change in the pattern of host and pathogen interaction. • For every two-degree rise in temperature, the agriculture GDP of India will reduce by five percent. • Poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, farmer distress and unrest, and larger political and social disaffection. • It will force farmers to either adapt to challenges of climate change or face the risk of getting poorer. Relevance of CSA • Increased productivity: Produce more food to improve food and nutrition security. • Enhanced resilience: Reduce vulnerability to drought, pests, disease, and other shocks. • Reduced emissions: Pursue lower emissions for each calorie or kilo of food produced, avoid deforestation from agriculture and identify ways to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. • The climate-smart agriculture approach seeks to reduce trade-offs and promote synergies to make agricultural system more productive and more sustainable. • Ecosystem and landscape management to conserve ecosystem services that are important for food security, agricultural development, adaptation and mitigation. Concerns / Challenges • Quick adaptation for new changes is hard, with farmers varying and mixing crops across seasons, along with heavy investments in borewells, tractors, and threshers. • Because of continuous crop failures, farmers are increasingly abandoning their lands and heading to nearby towns to find work as laborers. • With India’s climate expected to become warmer, intra seasonal and inter-annual weather variability is expected to increase. Way Forward • Farmers, especially smallholder farmers, need handholding during their scaling up to adopt CSA. • Mobile telecommunication systems are increasingly cost-effective and an efficient way of delivering weather-based agro-advisories to farmers at a large scale. • Weather-based agro-advisories must be locale-specific, crop-and farmer-specific. • On-site training and awareness campaigns, technology demonstrations, farmer-specialist interactions, and engagement with local governance bodies. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 17 • Closer collaboration between public, civil society, and private technology and financial service providers so that farmers get access to accurate information, and affordable technologies. • Farmer groups and the private sector can be mobilised to develop carbon markets in agriculture, which can reward farmers in cash for switching to low-carbon-intensive crops to lower GHG emissions. • Such a move towards “net-zero” agriculture will give India a “climate smart” agriculture. Conclusion • Climate-smart agriculture is not a new agricultural system, nor a set of practices. • It is an innovative approach for charting development pathways that can make the agriculture sectors more productive and sustainable and better able to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Topic: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation 15. Go circular to end plastic pollution Introduction • Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to our planet. • Global plastic pollution can reduce by 80 per cent by 2040 if countries shift to a circular economy according to a new report by UNEP. • However, any delays will mean higher costs and an additional 80 million tonnes of plastic pollution by 2040. Going Circular • Countries need to eliminate unnecessary and problematic plastic uses. • They need to make three market shifts — reuse, recycle, and reorient and diversify. • By promoting reuse options, enhancing recycling profitability, and replacing single-use plastics with alternatives, we can make substantial progress in reducing plastic pollution. • Single-use and short-lived products will still need to be safely dealt with. • Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes can ensure circularity through requiring producers to finance the collection, recycling and responsible end-of-life disposal of plastic products. Benefits of Circular Economy • Circular economy not only benefits the environment but also brings economic advantages. • Shift to a circular economy would result in $1.27 trillion in savings, considering costs and recycling revenues. • It could also result in a net increase of 700,000 jobs by 2040, especially in low-income countries. Government Initiatives • Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) 2.0 lays special emphasis on reduction of plastic waste generation. • Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules to encourage cities to phase out single-use plastic. • All States/UTs have constituted the Special Task Force (STF) for effective plastic waste management. • To expedite the transition of the country to a circular economy, multiple committees have been formed—led by the concerned line ministries and comprising officials from MoEFCC and NITI Aayog. • In an effort to empower citizens to help curb the plastic menace, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has launched a grievance redressal application. Concerns / Challenges • The ban on single-use plastics has not been followed through. • Products face high Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates because there is no distinction between a sustainable product and one with a large environmental footprint. • The absence of enabling policies keeps circular economy businesses small-scale, often informal, uncertified and undifferentiated. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 18 Way Forward • Setting and implementing safety standards for disposal of non-recyclable plastic waste. • Making manufacturers responsible for products shedding microplastics. • Increasing the demand for and use of recycled plastics in packaging, thus creating the value to accommodate the current costs of recycling. • International policies to enable recycled materials to compete on a level playing field with virgin materials. • Greener alternatives to plastic may be considered a sustainable option. For example, compostable and bio-degradable plastic, etc., may be considered as an option. • It is crucial for governments and businesses to take action and work together to build a sustainable future free from plastic pollution. Conclusion • India has immense resources — people, capital, supply chains and scale — to find value in waste. • A billion-dollar-valued circular economy unicorn can indeed emerge if technology, finance, policy and behavioural change could create markets 16. South Asia’s Climate Migration Introduction • Even after 50th anniversary of World Environment Day, 40% of the world’s population live in areas that are susceptible to the effects of climate change. • As the world struggles to cope with global economic imbalances, migration will become a necessity in the decades to come for countries at all levels of income. Climate displacement hotspots • South Asia houses the world’s most impacted climate displacement hotspots. • These include Hindu Kush-Himalaya region, coastal areas, island nations, and deltaic and semi-arid regions. • Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka are prone to sea level rise and coastal floods. • Bhutan, Afghanistan and Nepal are affected by glacial melt. • Small island nations such as the Maldives face the threat of submersion. • The situation is exacerbated by high population density, poverty, and inadequate infrastructure. • By 2050, nearly 216 million South Asians could be displaced due to climatic reasons. Costs of displacements • In 2020, South Asia saw the highest number of new displacements due to climate change. • Climate displacement results in job losses, food insecurity, and overcrowding of resources. • Poor economic capabilities reduce the adaptive capacity of communities. • The economic costs in South Asia include loss of skilled labour, and reduced productivity in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. • Social costs include breakdown of social networks and communities, mental health issues, social unrest, and conflict. • It forces people to migrate to urban areas and thus overburdens cities. • In 2020, 95% of conflict-related displacements were reported in climate vulnerable countries. Concerns / Challenges • Responses from governments and international agencies have been inadequate. • Most countries in South Asia lack comprehensive policies to address climate displacement. • Missed targets of climate funding hold back developing nations from financing their climate goals and building resilience. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 19 • Heatwaves is one of the deadliest disasters, particularly in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. Way Forward • Building climate-resilient infrastructure and improving disaster preparedness are essential to support adaptation and mitigation measures. • Governments and international agencies must recognise the severity of climate displacement in South Asia and mitigate its effects. • Develop targeted policies that address the specific needs of climate-displaced communities. • Policies should focus on providing alternative livelihood opportunities and social protection programmes to those affected. 17. The Role of Panchayats in tackling Climate Change Introduction • With rural households among the most vulnerable to climate change effects, panchayats can play a pivotal role in tackling the causes and consequences of global warming. Need to involve Panchayats • If India has to achieve the goals enunciated in the ‘Panchamrit’ resolution of the COP26 climate summit, it is necessary that panchayati raj institutions are involved. • It is necessary to have a suitable local action plan for implementation and enforcement, initiated and coordinated by local governments. • India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change 2008 identifies a range of priority areas for intervention at the national and State levels. • However, there would have been better results had panchayati raj institutions been given a greater role. India’s Vulnerability • Over the past few decades, there has been a manyfold increase in the number of climate-related national disasters. • Much of India’s population still lives in the rural areas and is involved in agriculture and other agri- based activities. • The greater variability in rainfall and temperatures has directly affected the livelihood and well-being of millions of rural households. Carbon neutrality projects across India • Human activities are the cause of the current climate crisis. • Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to extreme weather events are critical. • Zero carbon development is the effective solution to reducing anthropogenic emissions and improving climate resilience. Carbon neutral Meenangadi • In recent years, many panchayats have come forward with the concept of carbon neutrality. • A prominent example being Meenangadi gram panchayat in Kerala’s Wayanad district. • In 2016, the panchayat envisaged a project called ‘Carbon neutral Meenangadi’, the aim being to transform Meenangadi into a state of carbon neutrality. • An awareness programme was conducted initially. A greenhouse gases emission inventory was also prepared. • The panchayat was found to be carbon positive. • Several multi sector schemes were implemented to reduce emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and preserve the ecology and bio-diversity. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 20 • ‘Tree banking’ was one of landmark schemes introduced to aid carbon neutral activities which encouraged the planting of more trees by extending interest-free loans. • The entire community was involved in the process, with school students, youth, and technical and academic institutions. Example of Palli gram panchayat • There is also the example of Palli gram panchayat in Jammu and Kashmir that has followed the people-centric model. • The panchayat has prepared a climate-resilient plan where villagers have been made aware of climate change Mitigation. • A solar plant (500KW) has been installed to power 340 households. Initiatives by many other panchayats • There are many other panchayats that have also initiated carbon neutral programmes. • In Seechewal gram panchayat, the Kali Bein river was rejuvenated with people’s involvement. • Odanthurai panchayat in Tamil Nadu has its own windmill (350 KW). • Tikekarwadi gram panchayat in Maharashtra is well known for its extensive use of biogas plants and green energy production. • Chapparapadavu gram panchayat in Kerala has several green islands that have been nurtured by the community. Way Forward • There is a need for the documentation of best practices on carbon neutral programmes and for wider dissemination. • The integrated Panchayat Development Plan prepared by all panchayats is a stepping stone towards addressing many of the environmental concerns of villages. • India’s rural local bodies must contribute their strength to ensure the global target of carbon neutrality, as envisaged in the UN conference on climate change. Topic: Science and Technology- developments and their applications and effects in everyday life. 18. Research and production of Graphene Introduction • What Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to software and quantum computing is to computers, graphene is to materials. • India needs to catch up in the area of graphene. Properties of Graphene • Graphene is the world’s thinnest, strongest, and most conductive material of both electricity and heat. • It conducts electricity better than copper. • It is 200 times stronger than steel but six times lighter. • It is almost perfectly transparent as it absorbs only 2% of light. • It is impermeable to gases, even those as light as hydrogen and helium.

Graphene Market • Global graphene market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 46.6% between 2023 and 2030. • At least one graphene-enhanced product was launched every week in 2022. • Among the leading countries in graphene research are China, the U.S., the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Russia, and Singapore. • China and Brazil are global leaders in the commercial production of graphene. International efforts • China declared graphene a priority in its 13th Plan. • Europe set up the Graphene Flagship, with a budget of €1 billion in 2013. • At the Beijing Graphene Institute, several companies produce industry-grade graphene products. India’s progress • India produced a graphene-based system several years ago. • Tata Steel has succeeded in growing graphene. • It has also mixed graphene with used plastic products to recycle them as new. • Setting up of the India Innovation Centre for Graphene in Kerala. Concerns / Challenges • Graphene produced by India is about one-twentieth compared to China and one-third compared to Brazil. • High cost-to-volume ratio for high-grade graphene. • Its production may get concentrated in a few locations as in the case of semiconductors. Way Forward • The Centre needs to become the nodal point to spur large-scale innovation activity around graphene. • A nodal Ministry needs to be entrusted with the responsibility of national graphene mission. • India missed the semiconductor bus in the mid-1990s. The time to step on the graphene pedal is now. 19. Equity in Science Introduction • Imagine a world where everyone had an equal opportunity to pursue a career in science. • Where the next Einstein could come from any background, any country, any gender and not just the privileged few. • Equity in science is about unlocking the full potential of human ingenuity. Equity and Equality • Equality aims to provide identical treatment and opportunities to everyone. • Equity focuses on ensuring that everyone has the resources that they need to succeed, regardless of their circumstances. • Equality is about opportunity and access. Equity is about outcome. • Equity is critical for diversity of ideas in any society. Importance of scientific progress • In the wake of the global pandemic, the importance of scientific progress and innovation has never been more evident. • Science has the power to change the world — from healthcare and technology to policy and environment. INSTA MINDMAPS www.insightsonindia.com 22 Concerns / Challenges • Women and other marginalised groups continue to face barriers to enter and advance in scientific fields. • Lack of research funding and underrepresentation of certain groups. • Funding inequity can compound over time and create a cycle of exclusion within the scientific community. • Less attention has been paid to equity in the scientific publishing process. • Caste-based discrimination and the historical legacy of colonialism. Way Forward • Equity in science is thus not just about fairness, it’s about unleashing untapped potential. • A sustained, collective effort from individual institutions to national and international bodies could help create a more equitable and inclusive scientific community. • There is a need to reform funding processes. • Fostering collaboration between academia, industry and government. • Approaches that are critical to equitable outcomes: o promote gender-sensitive education and employment policies. o challenge patriarchal norms and practices. o address systemic inequalities based on caste, class, and religion.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
