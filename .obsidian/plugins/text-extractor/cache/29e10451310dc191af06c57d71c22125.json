Ther e ar e challenges in the selection of artists f or financial assistance in or ganizing cultural events. Lack of transpar ency in the selection pr ocess creates inequality in representation. Ther e is no systematic or r otational mechanism in place to provide this assistance, and the selection process is often random or based on subjective criteria. Talented artists, particularly those based outside the city , are unable to gain from sponsored platforms. Unlike in other countries, there are no serious ef forts by private or public institutions to promote contemporary artists as brands. Crime in the art world includes art theft, copyright infringement, for gery, fraud, and illicit trafficking. Addr essing these crimes r equir es incr eased security measur es, international cooperation, public awareness, and advanced technology for authentication and tracking.

Regular audits of acquir ed artworks can enhance trust and preserve a collection’ s integrity . An institutional r ecord of incoming and outgoing artworks with a verified identification mark is required.

Government support, cultural institutions, and initiatives provide financial assistance, training programmes, and opportunities for artists to exhibit their work. However, mor e efforts ar e needed to pr omote contemporary artists a s brands and ensure equal representation and financial assistance.
