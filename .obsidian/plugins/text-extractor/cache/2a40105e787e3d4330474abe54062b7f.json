What is an extremely heavy rainfall event? ● It occurs when more than 205 mm of rainfall happens at any place within a 24-hour period. (IMD) ● Such events of extremely heavy rainfall are not unexpected during the monsoon season. ● After the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy, there has not been a single year without at least one ma- jor disaster-like situation produced by an ex- treme rainfall event. Trends in recent years: ●\t Overall rainfall during the monsoon has re- mained more or less constant over the last two decades. ●\t But\tthe\tintra-seasonal\tvariation\thas\tincreased\t-\t www.insightsonindia.com3 fewer days are producing a bulk of the seasonal rainfall, while the rest of the days remain dry. How is this year’s monsoon rainfall unusual? ● The monsoon season this year was not expect- ed to be very wet. ● July rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Pun- jab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is substantially\thigher\t(by 26%) than normal. ● Heavy rain has resulted in large-scale destruc- tion\tand\tloss\tof\tlives, particularly in the hilly ar- eas. Reasons for this extreme rainfall: ●\t Rains induced by the Biparjoy cyclone: By the first two weeks of the monsoon, India had ac- cumulated a rainfall deficit of more than 50%. However, this deficit had come down to 8% by the end of June. ●\t Western disturbances: IMD has attributed this spell to an interaction between the monsoon winds and western disturbances that converged over northern India. ●\t Climate change: It is known to increase the possibility, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and heat waves. ●\t Warming of the Arabian Sea: Excess rainfall over northwest India is consistent with the Ara- bian Sea having warmed by about 1.5 degrees Celsius since January. How\tcan\tIndian\tcities\tbring\tthemself\tout\tof\tthese\ttrou- bled waters? ● The authorities need to plan the usage of shal- low aquifers to prevent waterlogging. ● At the same time, the city needs to recharge the deeper aquifers with rainwater. ● Forming a water plan to recharge aquifers ●\t Rainwater\t harvesting\t structures along the stormwater drains can help mitigate floods while utilizing rainwater resources. Conclusion: Only improved forecasts with sufficient granularity in space and time can reduce the element of surprise resulting from these extreme weather events. Insta Links: Cyclone Biparjoy Prelims Links: UPSC 2020 With reference to Ocean Mean Temperature (OMT), which of the following statements is/are correct? 1. OMT is measured up to a depth of 26°C isotherm which is 129 meters in the southwestern Indian Ocean during January — March. 2.

Select the correct answer using the code given below: 1. 1 only 2. 2 only 3. Both 1 and 2 4. Neither 1 nor 2 Ans: 2 GS Paper 1 IMPACT OF INDIA’S DEMO- GRAPHIC JOURNEY ON WOMEN’S LIVES Syllabus: Role\tof\tWomen\tand\tWomen’s\tOrganization Context: World Population Day (July 11) is a time to look at how India’s demographic journey has changed the lives of its citizens, particularly its women. India’s\tpopulation: ● It grew from about 340 million at Independence to 1.4 billion. ●\t This growth was fuelled by the improvement in public health, food security, etc. For exam- ple, male life expectancy was about 56 years (in www.insightsonindia.com4 1941); today, it is 69 years. ● With this rapid decline in mortality, parents no longer needed to have four children to ensure that at least two would survive. ● As a result, the\t Total\t Fertility\t Rate\t (TFR) fell from 5.7 in 1950 to 2.1 in 2019. Impact of reduced TFR: ● It brought a tectonic\tshift\tin\tthe\tlives\tof\tIndian\t women. ● Women’s childhood, adulthood, and old age have been transformed (both positively and negatively) over the course of the demographic transition. Change for Indian women: Childhood Adulthood Old age Sex-selec- tive abor- tions have de cline d - girl-sur- vival rate improved Creating\t space\t for\t education: With a fertility decline, active mothering oc- cupies a small- er proportion of women’s lives. Lower female labour force participation: By the time peak child- care demands end, they have missed the window for oc- cupations that require specific skills; only un- skilled work is open to them. Women generally marry men who are older and are more likely to outlive their husbands. The 2011 Census shows that while only 18% of men above age 65 are widowed, about 55% of the women are wid- owed. For widowed women, the lack of access to savings and proper- ty results in depen- dence on children, mainly sons, bringing the vicious cycle of son preference to full circle. Way ahead: ●\t Women\t need\t to\t establish\t secure\t connections to the labour market and gain work experience if they are to get skilled jobs. ●\t Enhancing women’s access to employment and assets will reduce their reliance on sons and could break the vicious cycle of gendered dis- advantage. ● As early marriage and childbearing remain cen- tral to Indian women’s lives, any efforts at im- proving women’s labour force participation must be accompanied by access to safe and affordable\tchildcare. How\tto\tensure\taccess\tto\tsafe\tand\taffordable\tchildcare? ●\t National\tRural\tEmployment\tGuarantee\tScheme\t (NREGS) can be used to develop social infra- structure where NREGS workers can help staff crèches. ● The burgeoning self-help group movement can be harnessed to set up neighbourhood child- care centres in urban and rural areas. Best\tpractice:\tCrèche facilities in Anganwadis in MP led to an increase in the work participation of mothers. Conclusion: Demographic dividends cannot be realised without fully harnessing the gender dividend. As chang- ing patriarchal norms may take a long time, improving access to childcare (for working women) is a low-hang- ing fruit.

What is the global MPI? ● It is a key international resource that measures (annually) acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100 developing countries. www.insightsonindia.com5 ●\t First launched in 2010 by UNDP and Oxford Pov- erty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), the global MPI advances SDG 1 - ending pover- ty in all its forms everywhere. ● It also measures interconnected deprivations across indicators related to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11. How\tdoes\tit\tmeasure\tmultidimensional\tpoverty? ●\t By\t constructing\t a\t deprivation\t profile\t for each household and person across 10 indicators spanning health,\teducation\tand\tstandard\tof\tliv- ing. ●\t A\t person\t is\t multidimensionally\t poor\t if s/he is deprived in one-third/33% or more of the weighted indicators out of the 10 indicators. ● Those who are deprived of one-half or more of the weighted indicators are considered living in extreme\tmultidimensional\tpoverty. Significance\tof\tthe\tglobal\tMPI:\tIt monitors poverty re- duction and informs policy, showing how people expe- rience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives. The 2023 global MPI: ●\t Prevalence: ●\t Distribution: ●\t Reduction: Good news: 25 countries, including India, successfully halved their global MPI values within 15 years. Concerns: ●\t Child poverty will continue to be a pressing is- sue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition. The poverty rate among children is 27.7%, while among adults is 13.4%. ●\t Poverty\tpredominantly\taffects\trural\tareas, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas. ●\t The lack of comprehensive data during the pe- riod of the COVID-19 pandemic poses challeng- es in assessing immediate prospects. ●\t The\t negative\t impacts\t of\t the\t pandemic in di- mensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. Case of India: ● In 2005/2006, about 645 million people were in multidimensional poverty in India, with this number declining to about 370 million in 2015/2016 and 230 million in 2019/2021. ○ Thus, 415 million poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021. ● Incidence fell from 55.1 to 16.4%. ●\t Deprivation\tin\tall\tindicators\tdeclined.\t ● The poorest states and groups, including chil- dren and people in disadvantaged caste groups, www.insightsonindia.com6 had the fastest absolute progress. ● The above findings are significant as India sur- passed China (in Apr 2023) to become the world’s most populous nation with 142 crore people. Way ahead: ●\t Intensify\tefforts to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected. ●\t Strengthen\tdata\tcollection\tand\tpolicy\tefforts to get poverty reduction back on track. ●\t Broaden the picture to include the impacts of the pandemic on children. Conclusion: The report demonstrates that poverty re- duction is achievable, demonstrating the feasibility of the SDG target - ending poverty in all its forms every- where by 2030.

WASTEWATER SURVEILLANCE The use of wastewater for public health surveillance offers significant benefits for disease prevention and control. It is a cost-effective\tapproach that does not rely on invasive samples from individuals. Wastewa- ter surveillance, integrated with existing surveillance mechanisms, could enhance India’s epidemiological capabilities by providing real-time insights into com- munity-level\tdisease\t patterns. This integration could be facilitated through efforts to strengthen public health laboratory networks and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. Usage: Wastewater surveillance for community disease prevention can be used as a point or way forward Facts for Prelims (FFP) EUROPEAN SKY SHIELD INITIA- TIVE’\t(ESSI) Context: Austria and Switzerland, traditionally neutral countries, have joined the ‘European Sky Shield Initia- tive’ (ESSI) for air defence in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. About ESSI: The European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) is a regional grouping of European countries aimed at developing a common air and missile defence system. It focuses on acquiring air defence equipment and missiles collec- tively to strengthen NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) The ESSI now has 19\tmember\tstates, with the goal of leveraging existing NATO cooperation frameworks for defence. It was spearheaded by Germany in 2022. www.insightsonindia.com7 LAST NATURAL PERSON ABOVE EVERY PERSON CLAUSE Context: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) clarified in the Supreme Court that the challenges it faced in the Hindenburg-Adani\tallegations\tcase were from the lack of a requirement to disclose the ‘last nat- ural person above every person’ owning an economic interest in the FPIs. What is ‘Last Natural Person Above Every Person’? It refers to the requirement to identify\tand\tdisclose\tthe\t ultimate\tindividual who has control or ownership over a financial investment such as Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI). It means revealing the final\tperson\tin\tthe\towner- ship chain who holds an economic interest in the FPI, ensuring transparency and accountability in the invest- ment structure. However, most of the national and international laws don’t have such provisions, FPI Vs FDI? •\t FPI\t(Foreign\tPortfolio\tInvestment) refers to in- vestments made by foreign individuals or enti- ties in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds of a country. •\t FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), on the other hand, refers to investments made by foreign in- dividuals or entities in tangible assets such as businesses, properties, or infrastructure proj- ects in a country. FDI typically involves a long- term\t commitment\t and\t a\t significant\t level\t of\t control and ownership in the invested entity, while FPI involves relatively shorter-term in- vestments in financial instruments without ob- taining control or ownership rights. Challenges posed by FPIs: •\t FPIs use multiple platforms, each below the limit for beneficial owner identification, to hold stakes (thus remaining below the radar of regu- latory agencies) •\t FPIs operate in tax haven jurisdictions, creating ambiguity around their ownership and control. SEBI’s recently Proposed Disclosure Requirements for FPIs Proposal Explanation Tighter Rules for High-Risk FPIs FPIs with over 50% concentration in a single group or assets valued above Rs 25,000 crore will be cat- egorized as high-risk. They must provide additional details about ownership, economic interests, and control rights. Transition\t Peri- od and Adher- ence FPIs with more than 50% exposure to a single corporate group will have a six-month transition period to reduce their exposure before com- plying with additional disclosure re- quirements. Detailed Own- ership Infor- mation\t and\t Enhanc e d Transparency SEBI aims to gather comprehensive ownership information of FPIs, in- cluding details about natural per- sons, public retail funds, and large public-listed companies, to improve transparency in the market. Stricter FPI Dis- closure Stan- dards If approved, the proposed rules will make India’s FPI disclosure stan- dards among the strictest globally, ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the financial sys- tem. FPI Categoriza- tion SEBI suggests categorizing FPIs based on their risk levels. Govern- ment entities, central banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be considered low-risk, while pension funds and public retail funds will be categorized as moderate-risk. All other FPIs will fall under the high- risk category. TWIN-BALANCE\tSHEET\tPROBLEM Context: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that the Indian economy has overcome the twin-bal- ance sheet problem and now enjoys a twin-balance sheet advantage. What is the Twin-Balance Sheet problem? The twin-balance sheet problem refers to a situation in which both\tbanks\tand\tcorporates\tface\tfinancial\tdis- tress simultaneously. It occurs when banks have a high amount of non-performing assets (bad loans) (NPA of public sector banks reached almost 12% in 2016-17) on their balance sheets, and corporates have accumulat- www.insightsonindia.com8 ed excessive debt, leading to a negative impact on the overall economy. RBI’s recent Financial Stability Report states that both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have strengthened and India might be on the cusp of a twin balance sheet advantage. •\t The\tgross\tNPA\tratio fell to a 10-year low of\t3.9%. •\t The corporate balance sheet is also at its health- iest in 10 years. •\t The\tprofitability\tof\tpublic\tsector\tbanks has tri- pled since 2014, reaching over ₹1 lakh crore in 2022-23. Some\tof\tthe\tinitiatives\ttaken\tby\tthe\tgovernment\tare:\t •\t 4R strategy (recognizing, recapitalizing, resolv- ing, and reforming); •\t Central\t Repository\t of\t Information\t on\t Large\t Credits (CRILC) to enable banks to share infor- mation on large loans; •\t Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 •\t National\t Asset\t Reconstruction\t Company(NAR- CL) to handle bad debt STANDARD OPERATING PROCE- DURE\t(SOP)\tBY\tCBIC Context: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Cus- toms (CBIC) has issued a standard operating procedure (SoP) to prevent the use of freebies, illicit liquor, and other prohibited items to lure voters during upcoming elections in India. What is SoP? It is a set of guidelines and instructions that define how a particular task or process should be carried out. SoPs are created to ensure consistency, efficiency, and com- pliance with established protocols. About SoP by CBIC: •\t Aim: The SoP aims to ensure fair and transpar- ent elections by preventing the flow of suspi- cious cash, illicit liquor, drugs/narcotics, free- bies and smuggled goods during assembly and general elections. •\t Monitoring: In line with the directions\t of\t the\t Election\t Commission, CBIC has instructed its field officials to monitor both monetary and non-monetary inducements used during the election process. •\t Surveillance: The officials will establish surveil- lance teams, conduct checks on vehicles and warehouses, and apprehend smuggled goods. Setting up flying\tsquads\tand\tstatic\tsurveillance teams for vehicles check and verification of warehouses. •\t Confiscation: Movement of items like saris, par- ty flags etc. associated with candidates or polit- ical parties without an e-way bill may be confis- cated. •\t Reporting: The tax officers will report their ac- tivities to the Election Commission on a daily basis. About CBIC: It is a government body under the Ministry of Finance in India. It is responsible for formulating\tpolicies\trelat- ed\tto\tcustoms,\texcise\tduties,\tGST,\tand\tnarcotics. CBIC oversees the administration and collection of these tax- es and is the administrative authority for its subordi- nate organizations. These include Custom Houses, Cen- tral Excise and GST Commissionerates, and the Central Revenues Control Laboratory. NEW WHEAT VARIETY Context: The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has developed a new variety of wheat called PBW RS1, which has high amylose starch content. Advantages: •\t Reduce the risks of type-2 diabetes and car- diovascular diseases: Chapatis made from this wheat release glucose more slowly into the www.insightsonindia.com9 bloodstream, providing a feeling of satiety and potentially reducing the prevalence of diet-re- lated diseases. •\t It is resistant to yellow rust and moderately re- sistant to brown rust fungal diseases. Concern: It has slightly lower productivity compared to other va- rieties. About Starch: Starch is a complex carbohydrate found in various plant-based foods, such as grains, potatoes, and le- gumes. It serves as a storage form of energy in plants. Starch is composed of glucose molecules that are joined together in long chains. About Amylose: Amylose is a type of starch found in various carbohy- drate-rich foods, including grains like wheat. It is one of the two main components of starch, the other being amylopectin. Foods with higher amylose content gen- erally\thave\ta\tslower\tdigestion\trate and a lower impact on blood sugar levels compared to foods with higher amylopectin content. HYDRAZINE HYDRATE Context: Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd (GACL) (state PSU) has started dispatching indigenously made Hydrazine Hydrate, a chemical product used in various industries. This move aims to reduce India’s depen- dence on imports from Europe. What is Hydrazine Hydrate? Hydrazine Hydrate is a chemical compound with the formula N2H4·H2O. It is a colourless liquid that is wide- ly used as a reducing agent, a chemical intermediate, an oxygen scavenger in the treatment of boiler water, and a rocket propellant. It has applications in industries such as pesticides, agrochemicals, water treatment, pharma- ceuticals, polymer production, and fine chemicals. About: GACL, in collaboration with CSIR-IICT, Hyderabad, has received patents for indigenous manufacturing of Hy- drazine Hydrate. The company has established a com- mercial-scale plant in Dahej to produce 10,000 metric tonnes per annum of Hydrazine Hydrate. Additionally, GACL has also set up a Purified\tPhosphoric\tAcid\tplant to meet the demand for this chemical in various indus- tries. KLOTHO Context: A new study has revealed that Injecting ageing monkeys with a ‘longevity factor’ protein that can re- store levels of Klotho, can improve their cognitive func- tion, a study reveals. What is Klotho? Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene and produced in Kidney. Circulating levels of soluble Klotho decrease with age and the Klotho gene is associated with increased risk of age-related diseases. Significance\tof\tthe\tfindings: The findings could lead to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Previous research on mice had shown that injections\tof\t klotho\tcan\textend\tits\tlives\tand\tincrease\tsynaptic\tplas- ticity (the capacity to control communication between neurons, at junctions called synapses).
