Since investors in PPFCF look for capital investment and returns in Rupee terms, PPFCF also looks at delivering in Rupee terms. PPFCF hedges most of the currency exposure using currency futures. Outlook About Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (PPFCF) is an open ended equity oriented scheme with flexibility to invest a minimum of 65% in Indian equities and up to 35% in overseas equity security and domestic debt / money market securities. We continue to look at individual investments on their own merits and will not hesitate to invest if an opportunity looks attractive. As usual, our investment stance does not depend much on the macro-economic situation but is focussed on individual companies. We have about 9.93% in cash holdings, debt & money market instruments and arbitrage positions which can be deployed in long term investments at appropriate levels. The core portfolio consists of equity investments made with a long term outlook and the factors considered while investing are quality of management, quality of the sector and the business (return on capital, entry barriers, capital intensity, use of debt, growth prospects etc) and the valuation of the companies. The endeavor of the fund management team is to identify opportunities for long term investments. However there are times when the opportunities are not attractive enough. While waiting for attractive opportunities, the fund invests in arbitrage opportunities between the cash and futures equity markets and special situations arbitrage where open offers / delisting / merger events have been announced. Investments are also made in money market / debt securities while waiting for deployment in core equity investments. Mr. Rajeev Thakkar CIO & Director Is 'recency bias' aﬀecting you? Investors could be of two types. The first type will have noticed that the equity market indices and Net Asset Values (NAVs) of our equity funds are somewhat lower than what were seen between October 2021 and March 2022. The other type of investor would not have noticed the fall or ignored the fall despite noticing it. If you are in the second category, congratulations. You need not read further. For investors who are closely watching the indices, stock prices and mutual fund NAVs, especially those who are new to equity investing, I will say that it is not unusual for equity prices to fall. In fact it is of utmost importance that equity prices fall steeply over some period in an unpredictable manner! Why do I say this? The answer is simple. If stock prices only went up, there would be no one investing in bonds or in bank fixed deposits and so on. The reason why equity investments have the potential to deliver higher returns is that periodically they give negative returns as well which scares away short term investors and risk averse investors. There is a chance that some investors who have recently entered the market may see negative returns on their lumpsum / SIP investments currently. Since our launch in 2013, we have been communicating that equity investments are suitable only for a minimum investment horizon of 5 years. This has been due to the fact that the current situation is quite common and one has to be invested in equity across a bull and bear market cycle to really benefit from equity investing. The current narrative is driven by discussions around inflation due to high energy and commodity prices, the war between Russia and Ukraine, rising interest rates, quantitative tapering, potential US recession and so on. Reading of the popular media narrative would lead us to believe that something unusual is happening in the world. However if one looks at interest rates, they are back to where they were about 3 to 3.5 years ago and crude oil prices are way below the peak levels seen in late 2007 and early 2008. High / low prices of crude oil, onions and tomatoes make for good news stories but at the end of the day they are subject to supply and demand disruptions (surplus as well as deficit) which are generally short lived and the prices mean revert generally in a short period of time. As I write this today, many commodities like iron ore, aluminum and copper are trading at significantly lower prices as compared to the peak prices seen a few months back. Today we do not worry about COVID 19 while only a few months back there was nothing else that we could talk or think about. In the same manner, two years hence, it is very likely that we will have different things to worry about. Please do not let the turbulence and headlines distract you from your long term investment journey. Stick to your asset allocation based on your needs, life stage and risk appetite. Happy investing.

He is usually part of a larger team of fund managers and research analysts. Application amount for fresh subscription SIP or systematic investment plan work on the principle of making periodic investments of a fixed sum. It works similar to a recurring bank deposit. For instance, an investor may opt for an SIP that invests 500 every 15 ` th of the month in an equity fund for a period of three years. The NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is calculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund. A group of securities, usually a market index whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual funds, among other investments. Some typical benchmark include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE 200, BSE 500, 10-year Gsec. A mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an investor purchase the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the entry load is 1%, the investor will enter the fund at Rs 101. Exit load is charged at the time of redeeming (or transferring an investment between schemes). The exit load percentage is deducted from the NAV at the time of redemption (or transfer between schemes). This amount goes to the respective scheme and gets added to the AUM of that Scheme Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment’s performance. When a mutual fund Scheme has a high standard deviation, its range of performance is wide implying greater volatility. The Sharpe Ratio named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Beta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta of greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market. AUM or assets under management refers to the recent / updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment firm. The holding or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in term of percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund manager. The investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance a mutual fund that aims at generating capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories. A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold - whichever is less - over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value (NAV) of the fund. The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period. The yield to maturity (YTM) of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the (theoretical) internal rate of return (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond is held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments are made on schedule. Modified duration is a formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates. Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions. The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total cost of a fund to the investor. Total costs may include various fees (purchase, redemption, auditing) and other expenses. The TER, calculated by dividing the total annual cost by the fund'stotal assets averaged over that year, is denoted as a percentage.
