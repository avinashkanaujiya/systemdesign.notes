Strange as it may sound, not every owner has this same objective. There are broadly three categories of owners to avoid in order to mitigate type I risk. First, government-owned businesses. A long-term investor’s aims are typically not aligned with the government. It is not that the government objectives are “wrong\"—they make sense in the light of multiple constituencies they need to sat- isfy. They are just different from investors’ objectives. Listed subsidiaries of global giants should also be avoided. Global MNCs like P&G, Unilever, Siemens, Cummins, Nestle and many others have locally listed subsidiaries. There is a structural problem with this arrangement because the paivar is interested in its own value creation and not that of the subsidiary. Lastly,itis best to avoid conglomerates. Value creation is possible only through sustained focus. So how does one achieve excellence across multiple entities across entirely different industries? IU’s hard, but not impossible. Maybe a conglomerate will succeed in creating great businesses across their entire portfolio one day, but that glo- rious future is not worth the wait. $","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
