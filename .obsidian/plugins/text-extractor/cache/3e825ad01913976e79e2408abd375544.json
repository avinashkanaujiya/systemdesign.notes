Since investors in PPFCF look for capital investment and returns in Rupee terms, PPFCF also looks at delivering in Rupee terms. PPFCF hedges most of the currency exposure using currency futures. Outlook About Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (PPFCF) is an open ended equity oriented scheme with flexibility to invest a minimum of 65% in Indian equities and up to 35% in overseas equity security and domestic debt / money market securities. We continue to look at individual investments on their own merits and will not hesitate to invest if an opportunity looks attractive. As usual, our investment stance does not depend much on the macro-economic situation but is focussed on individual companies. We have about 9.93% in cash holdings, debt & money market instruments and arbitrage positions which can be deployed in long term investments at appropriate levels. The core portfolio consists of equity investments made with a long term outlook and the factors considered while investing are quality of management, quality of the sector and the business (return on capital, entry barriers, capital intensity, use of debt, growth prospects etc) and the valuation of the companies. The endeavor of the fund management team is to identify opportunities for long term investments. However there are times when the opportunities are not attractive enough. While waiting for attractive opportunities, the fund invests in arbitrage opportunities between the cash and futures equity markets and special situations arbitrage where open offers / delisting / merger events have been announced. Investments are also made in money market / debt securities while waiting for deployment in core equity investments. Mr. Rajeev Thakkar CIO & Director Why we did what we did... Rajeev Thakkar Chief Investment Oﬃcer and Director There may be a few questions in the minds of unitholders / distributors / advisors regarding a few recent portfolio actions. These are explained briefly below. Switch from HDFC Bank to HDFC Ltd.\u0001 Some time back we switched from HDFC Bank to HDFC Ltd. The background to this is that the two companies have already announced a merger and the merger ratio is known. Given that they are from the same group and had already sought informal permission / consultation with the relevant authorities, the merger going through is largely a formality. Today whether one owns HDFC Bank or HDFC Ltd., eventually one will own HDFC Bank. Given that we intend holding on to HDFC Bank, it makes sense to invest in the company which is cheaper given the exchange ratio. There was a 3% difference between the two companies after transaction costs. This position, which is close to 2,000 crores ₹ (about 8% of the portfolio) gives a benefit of nearly 60 crores - or a 24 basis points - benefit on the entire portfolio. While this ₹ optically increases the portfolio churn, we are owning the same underlying business. Rebalancing of ITC weightage We were buyers in ITC Ltd. and bulk of the purchases were made between a price of 210. While the stock ₹ 140 and ₹ continues to be reasonably valued, the attractiveness has obviously reduced a bit given the doubling of the stock price from the lows. The portfolio weightage was threatening to breach 10% of the portfolio. When a position breaches the 10% limit on account of price appreciation, it is termed as a passive breach and one has about a one month’s time period to bring the weightage down below 10%. It is prudent not to have a very large position in a single stock. Given this background we have sold some shares and brought down the weightage. Managing your money using principles!Value Investing Coal India Ltd. and covered calls Our investment in Coal India may have surprised a few people given the following ● The world is moving towards renewable / non fossil sources of energy ● Our preference has been generally towards private sector businesses rather than public sector ones However the anticipated shift towards renewable energy has resulted in a steep drop in share prices of traditional energy related companies and a huge under-investment in the sector. This has resulted in price spikes and shortages. We are strong believers in the shift towards renewable sources of energy and we did not view Coal India Ltd as a ‘buy-and-hold for decades’ kind of company. We had the following thesis for a good holding period return in the medium term: ● High dividend yield ● Some volume growth in production and sales to reduce import dependence ● Possibility of some price increase given the steep discount at which Coal India sells coal as compared to global prices (to compensate for wage increases paid by Coal India and to provide some additional profit). ● Low probability of the valuation multiple reducing further and a high probability of some mean reversion in the valuation multiple ● And lastly… Selling ‘out-of-the-money’ covered call options prudently over time can help us generate additional income. Of course, we write covered calls only on a limited portion of the overall holding. Generating this additional income comes with the trade-off that on the few occasions wherein a stock sees an outsized move, our position in the underlying stock will be sold (at a profit). This happened last month wherein some of the shares that we owned were sold as part of the covered calls at a profit from our purchase price. Thoughts on ESG Because of our purchase of ITC and Coal India shares, there are questions around our stance on ESG. Firstly we are not deliberately trying to invest in anti ESG companies. Our Fund does not have an ESG mandate but surely we do not want to harm humanity in pursuit of profits. We want all of our investee companies to be well Governed (the G part of ESG). On the Environmental and Social fronts however, we believe that there is a case for some nuance. Tobacco is a demerit good and known to cause cancer. Towards this end, there is a ban on advertising, ban on sale of the products to minors, punitive rates of taxation, ban on smoking in public and so on and we are fully supportive of those actions. ITC itself has seen the writing on the wall and has been diversifying into newer areas in FMCG like snacks, beverages, personal care and so on. Coal India is also preparing for a world where renewable energy will take over from fossil fuels. However, one cannot wish away current realities by say, suddenly switching off all coal fired power plants. Europe currently is seeing the problems of switching off coal and nuclear plants too early in the eagerness to embrace solar and wind energy. We will continue to invest in well governed companies and cheer our investee companies in their efforts to improve the society and the planet by their societal and environmental impact. We will also engage with them on account of our stewardship role where required.

Some typical benchmark include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE 200, BSE 500, 10-year Gsec. A mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an investor purchase the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is ` 100 and the entry load is 1%, the investor will enter the fund at Rs 101. Exit load is charged at the time of redeeming (or transferring an investment between schemes). The exit load percentage is deducted from the NAV at the time of redemption (or transfer between schemes).

When a mutual fund Scheme has a high standard deviation, its range of performance is wide implying greater volatility. The Sharpe Ratio named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Beta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta of greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market. AUM or assets under management refers to the recent / updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment firm. The holding or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in term of percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund manager. The investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance a mutual fund that aims at generating capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories.

The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period. The yield to maturity (YTM) of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the (theoretical) internal rate of return (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond is held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments are made on schedule. Modified duration is a formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates. Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions. The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total cost of a fund to the investor. Total costs may include various fees (purchase, redemption, auditing) and other expenses. The TER, calculated by dividing the total annual cost by the fund'stotal assets averaged over that year, is denoted as a percentage.
