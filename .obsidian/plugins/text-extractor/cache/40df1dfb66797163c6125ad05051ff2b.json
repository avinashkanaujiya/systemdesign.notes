All 28 states of India and the union territories (UTs) of Delhi and Puducherry have legislatures. Six states (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) have legislatures with two Houses, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. In August 2019, the state of Jammu & Kashmir was reorganised into the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir (with a legislature) and Ladakh. The new legislature will be constituted after elections are held in the UT. Legislatures have three primary responsibilities: discussing and passing Bills, scrutinising and approving government finances, and holding the government accountable. This report analyses the working of 30 state legislatures in 2022, focusing on their law-making role. Data and information on state legislatures is not easily available. This analysis is based on data obtained from state legislatures, state gazettes, and responses to Right to Information (RTI) requests.

Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 1 FUNCTIONING OF STATE LEGISLATURES Legislatures have three primary responsibilities: discussing and passing Bills, scrutinising and approving government finances, and holding the government accountable. These functions are carried out when the legislature meets (plenary sittings of the legislature), and in Committees of legislatures. Over the last several years, state legislatures have been meeting for fewer days, which impacts the effectiveness of their work. Most states also do not have well-functioning Committees. Bills are rarely scrutinised before passing, and while expenditure by states is increasing every year, the spending is not discussed in detail before being approved by the legislature. In 2022, state legislatures met for an average of 21 days, with each sitting lasting for an average of five hours. During this time, they passed more than 500 Bills and their respective state budgets. Only seven States met for more than 30 days in 2022 In 2022, 28 state assemblies met for 21 days on average. Karnataka met for the highest number of days (45), followed by West Bengal (42), and Kerala (41). West Bengal and Maharashtra met for more days in 2022 as compared to 2021. In 2021, they met for 19 and 15 days respectively. States which met for fewer days in 2022 as compared to 2021 include Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Telangana. 17 states met for less than 20 days, and of these, three met for less than 10 days (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Tripura). Figure 1: Number of sitting days of state legislative assemblies in 2022 Note: Data for Manipur and Uttarakhand was not available. Sources: Assembly websites of various states; RTI; PRS. Six states (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) have legislatures with two Houses - a Legislative Assembly and a Legislative Council. Councils are elected by different sections of the population (teachers, graduates, local bodies, and MLAs), and have the power to require reconsideration of Bills, and ask questions. Legislative Councils met for the same or fewer days than the corresponding Assembly in 2022. On average, they met for 25 days. Figure 2: Number of sitting days of state legislative councils in 2022 Note: Data for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh was not available. Sources: Assembly websites of various states; PRS. 61% of sitting days were in Budget Sessions In most states, legislatures meet for two or three sessions in a year - a longer budget session, held between January and March, followed by brief monsoon and winter sessions. Twelve states, including five in the North- East Region, met for only two sessions in 2022. In 2022, 61% of sittings were held during the budget session. Tamil Nadu held more than 90% of its sittings in the budget session. Gujarat and Rajasthan held more than 80% of their sittings in the budget session. Each sitting lasted for five hours on average In 2022, the average duration of a sitting (across 20 states) was five hours. On average, a sitting in Maharashtra lasted eight hours, while in Sikkim it lasted for two hours. However, there could be significant variation in the duration of sittings in a state. For instance, in Chhattisgarh, while a sitting was seven hours long on average, one sitting (where a no-confidence motion was discussed) lasted longer than 13 hours.

Kerala had the highest number of average sitting days at 48 days a year, followed by Odisha (41), and Karnataka (35). Average sitting days have declined steadily from 2016 to 2022, with a dip in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sitting days reduced the most in Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa. Three states, Haryana, Punjab, and Tripura, have not met for more than 20 days in any year since 2016. Figure 4: Average sitting days for 24 states Note: The chart above only includes the 24 states which are shown in Figure 5. Sources: Assembly websites of various states; RTI; PRS. Figure 5: Average number of sitting days of state assemblies (2016-2022) Note: The data for Sikkim and Puducherry is the average number of sitting days for 2017-2022; the chart above does not include Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Uttarakhand. Sources: Assembly websites of various states; RTI; PRS. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) had recommended that states set a minimum number of sitting days for state legislatures, based on the number of members in the Assembly.1 States such as Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh have mandated a minimum number of sitting days for their legislature. This has been done through the Rules of Procedure of their Assemblies, or through legislation.2 These limits vary from 35 days in Himachal Pradesh to 90 days in Uttar Pradesh.3,4 None of these states have met the target since 2016 (from which year data has been collected for these states). In four states, a session continued for the entire year An Assembly session begins with a summons by the Governor, and ends when the Governor issues a notice of prorogation. Both the summons and prorogation are issued on the advice of the state cabinet. In 2022, sessions were not prorogued for the entire year in several states. The same session continued throughout the year in Delhi, Rajasthan, Telangana, and West Bengal with long adjournment between sittings. This allowed the Assemblies to convene their sittings without a summons issued by the Governor. Rajasthan did not prorogue its session in 2021 either. Press reports indicate that the Rajasthan Governor had questioned the cabinet recommendation in 2020 to summon the Assembly.5,6 States discussed budgets for eight days on average Article 202 of the Constitution requires state governments to present the budget before the Legislature every year. By discussing and passing the budget, the legislature exercises financial scrutiny over the government. Budgets are discussed in two stages, the general discussion, which immediately follows the budget presentation, and the discussion on Ministry expenditure (see Figure 6). On average, 20 states discussed budgets for eight days in 2022. Tamil Nadu spent 26 days on the entire budget discussion, followed by Karnataka (15), Kerala (14), and Odisha (14). Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab discussed their budgets for two days each. Nagaland discussed and passed its budget in a day. Figure 6: Process of passing a Budget in state legislatures Note: The dotted line, and different colour coding indicates that the Committee stage is not present in all states. 31 30 27 25 17 22 23 0 20 40 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 20 26 31 26 16 18 26 14 28 24 35 48 21 33 41 14 14 28 12 33 20 11 20 32 0 20 40 60 AP AS BR CG DL GA GJ HR HP JH KA KL MP MH OD PY PB RJ SK TN TS TR UP WB Presentation of Budget by Finance Minister General Discussion Scrutiny of Demands by Committees Discussion and voting on Ministry expenditure Passing of Appropriation Bill Passing of Finance Bill Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 3 Figure 7: Days for which budget and Ministry expenditure were discussed in 2022 Note: Data for Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Puducherry, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, and Uttarakhand was not available. Sources: Assembly websites; PRS. In Parliament, Ministry expenditures are examined by standing committees before being discussed in the House. However, most states do not have committees for this purpose. The discussion on Ministry expenditure begins almost immediately after the general discussion. In 2022, 13 states began their discussion on Ministry expenditure on the same day as the general discussion or the next day. Kerala, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu had a gap of more than five days between the two discussions. Having a gap before discussing Ministry expenditure gives legislators more time to examine the budgetary expenditure of each ministry. Figure 8: Days between general discussion and discussion on Ministry expenditure in states Note: Within a day implies that the discussion on Ministry expenditure began on the day that the general discussion ended, or the very next day. Sources: Assembly websites; PRS. Committees to scrutinise Ministry expenditure In February 2023, Haryana constituted eight standing committees for the specific purpose of scrutinising Ministry expenditure for the year 2023-24.7 Each committee was allocated certain ministries whose budgets had to be scrutinised. Their reports had to be tabled in the House before the discussion on Ministry expenditure. Six states, including Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, and Nagaland have provided for Budget Committees in their Rules of Procedure. In Goa, this Committee conducts a post scrutiny of the Budget.8 Three sub-committees examine the budgets of different ministries. Reports of the sub-committees, after presentation to the Speaker, are forwarded to the concerned ministries. The ministries are required to file Action Taken Responses to the recommendations of the sub-committee within 60 days. States (like the Centre) do not discuss expenditure demands of all ministries. Some states, like Rajasthan and West Bengal discussed less than 50% of proposed expenditure of government ministries on the floor of the House. Five states, including Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh passed budgetary demands of all ministries without discussion. 6 2 9 12 7 4 11 15 14 2 5 4 7 1 14 2 13 26 3 7 0 10 20 30 CG DL GA GJ HP HR JH KA KL MP MH MG MZ NL OD PB RJ TN UP WB General Discussion Discussion on Ministry Expenditure Average 13 4 3 0 5 10 15 Within a day 2 to 5 days 5+ daysNumber of states Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 4 OVERVIEW OF LAW MAKING In 2022, state legislatures passed more than 500 Bills on various subjects including land, labour, and social justice. This section looks at the legislative work in state legislatures. Appropriation Bills and Finance Bills, which are passed to sanction government expenditure, are not included in this analysis. Figure 9: The process of passing a Bill in state assemblies Note: The first arrow is dotted as not all Bills are referred to Committees. In a bicameral legislature, this process is repeated in the other House, i.e., the Legislative Council as well. On average, states passed 21 Bills in 2022 28 states passed 21 Bills on average in 2022. The highest number of Bills were passed by Assam (85), followed by Tamil Nadu (51), and Goa (38). Assam passed 85 Bills in 2022, 51 more than they passed in 2021 (34). 13 other states passed more Bills in 2022 than in 2021. 11 States, including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha passed fewer Bills in 2022 as compared to 2021. Nagaland passed the fewest Bills (3), followed by Puducherry (4). A list of Bills passed by states is given in the Appendix. Figure 10: Number of Bills passed by state legislatures in 2022 Note: The chart above does not include Manipur and Uttarakhand. Sources: State Gazettes; Assembly websites of various state assemblies; RTI; PRS. 56% Bills passed within a day of introduction A Bill becomes law once it is passed by the legislature (and receives assent of the Governor/ President). Lawmakers must discuss and scrutinise Bills in detail before passing. However, state legislatures often pass most Bills quickly without much debate and deliberation, which brings into question the quality of such laws. In 2022, 56% of Bills i.e., 322 Bills, were passed on the day of introduction or the very next day. In 2021, this proportion was 44%. In 2022, nine states including Bihar, Gujarat, Punjab, and West Bengal passed all Bills within a day of introduction. These states passed all Bills within a day in 2021 as well. Four states took more than five days to pass the majority of their Bills. These are Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, and Rajasthan. Rajasthan passed 73% of Bills after at least five days of their introduction in the legislature. The corresponding figure was 67% for Kerala, and 59% for Karnataka. Figure 11: Time taken by state legislatures to pass Bills in 2022 Note: The chart above does not include Manipur and Uttarakhand. A Bill is considered passed within a day if it was passed on the day of introduction or on the next day. For states with bicameral legislatures, Bills have to be passed in both Houses. This has been taken into account in the above chart for four states having Legislative Councils, except Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (information was not available).

For instance, in July 2022, Goa introduced and passed 26 Bills in the last two days of a ten-day session. Other days saw minimal legislative activity. In Haryana, 15 Bills were introduced on one day in December 2022, and were all passed over the next two days. The Andhra Pradesh legislature passed 13 Bills on one day in September 2022. Of these, six were introduced and passed by both Houses on the same day. Passing multiple Bills on the same day also implies that state legislatures are spending less time discussing the various provisions of Bills on the floor of the House. For instance, in Himachal Pradesh, a Bill was discussed for 10 minutes on average. Around 5% of the Bills were referred to committees for examination After a Bill has been introduced in the House, it may be referred to a Committee of the Assembly for detailed examination. Committees work irrespective of whether the legislature is in session, and enable a deeper discussion on every clause of a Bill. They can also seek inputs from stakeholders, sectoral experts, and government functionaries to understand the implications of a Bill. This improves participation in the law- making process and allows for expert feedback on legislative proposals. However, state legislatures rarely refer Bills to Committees. In 2022, across states, less than 30 Bills were referred to Committees for detailed study. Legislatures may also set up ad-hoc, Select or Joint Committees (in the case of bicameral legislatures) for the specific purpose of examining a Bill. The Haryana Police (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and the Rajasthan Right to Health Bill, 2022 were introduced in 2022 and referred to Select Committees. The Select Committee examining the Rajasthan Right to Health Bill, 2022 presented its report on March 20, 2023, six months after the Bill was referred to it. The Bill was passed the very next day. Two Bills referred to Select Committees in 2021 were passed in 2022 - the Sports University of Haryana Bill, 2021, and the Himachal Pradesh Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Some states, like Kerala, refer Bills to permanent subject Committees. In 2022, 80% of Bills passed by Kerala were examined by Committees. The Kerala Public Health Bill, 2021, was introduced in 2021 and referred to a subject Committee. Public consultations on the Bill were held in cities across the state, and the findings were included in the Committee report.9 The Bill was passed in 2023. However, the subject Committees in Kerala are chaired by their respective Ministers. In Parliament, Ministers are not part of subject Committees. West Bengal and Odisha have also constituted subject Committees. Ministers are not part of Committees in either of these states.10,11 The Rajasthan Right to Health Bill, 2022 examined by a Select Committee The Rajasthan Right to Health Bill, 2022 was introduced in the Assembly on September 22, 2022, and was referred to a Select Committee on the next day.12 The Bill provides people in the state the right to health, and access to healthcare. This includes free health care services at any clinical establishment to residents of the state. It also sets obligations on the state government to ensure this right and maintain public health. The Bill was passed on March 21, 2023, with some recommendations of the Select Committee incorporated in the Bill. These include: ▪ Free health service for a state resident: The original Bill did not mention the specific establishments the citizens could approach to avail free health services. The Committee recommended that public health institutions, health care establishments, and designated healthcare centres be listed in the Bill. The Bill as passed includes the above establishments. ▪ Accidental emergency: The original Bill provided that any resident is entitled to free emergency treatment and care under any emergent circumstances. However, the Bill did not define such emergency situations. The Committee recommended defining such terms clearly. The Bill as passed defines emergencies to include unforeseen, unexpected, or unintentional occurrences which result in the risk of death or injury to any person and include road, rail, water, or air accidents. ▪ Grievance redressal mechanism: The original Bill provided that the District Health Authority would upload Action Taken Reports of complaints on a web portal within 30 days of receiving a complaint. The Committee recommended that this provision be deleted. The Bill as passed removed the provision. Allocating time for discussion of Bills State legislatures publish a legislative agenda at the beginning of each session. This lists the Bills which will be introduced, discussed and passed in the upcoming session, and the time to be spent on each Bill. Often, very little time is allocated for the discussion of individual Bills. In Uttarakhand, 13 Bills were listed for discussion and passing on one day in November 2022. Of these, 11 Bills were to be discussed for five minutes each, and then passed. The other two Bills were allocated 20 minutes each. Sources: Assembly website; PRS. Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 6 57% of Bills received assent from the Governor within a month A Bill must receive the assent of the Governor or the President to become an Act. Article 200 of the Constitution empowers the Governor to: (i) grant assent, (ii) withhold assent, (iii) return the Bill for reconsideration, or (iv) reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President. 13 The Constitution provides that the Governor give assent to Bills as soon as possible. In 2022, 57% of Bills received the assent of the respective Governor within a month. States, where the average time for Bills to receive assent was the shortest, include Sikkim (two days), Gujarat (six days), and Mizoram (six days). On average, it took 188 days for a Bill to receive assent in Delhi, the longest among all states and Union Territories. Other states with comparatively longer time for assent are West Bengal (97 days on average) and Chhattisgarh (89 days). Figure 12: Time taken to give assent to Bills passed in 2022 Note: The chart above only includes Bills that were passed in 2022 and have received assent as of May 4, 2023, in the states shown in Figure 10.

Delayed assent on the Tamil Nadu Online Gambling and Gaming Bill The Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Online Gambling and Regulation of Online Games Ordinance, 2022 was promulgated by the Governor on October 1, 2022. The Ordinance prohibits online gambling and online games of chance played for money or other stakes. A Bill replacing the Ordinance was introduced and passed in the Assembly on October 19, 2022. However, it was returned by the Governor. It was then re-introduced and passed in the Assembly on March 23, 2023. The Bill received assent from the Governor on April 7, 2023. On April 10, 2023, the Assembly passed a resolution stating that the Governor must give assent to Bills passed by the Assembly within a specific time period. Sources: Assembly websites; news reports; State e-Gazette; PRS. 79 Ordinances issued by 12 states in 2022 While the primary power to make law rests with the legislature, the Constitution also gives the Executive some law-making powers in emergency situations. Under Article 213, the Governor of a state may promulgate an Ordinance in exceptional circumstances, which will have the effect of a law.14 These are temporary laws which the government can make when the legislature is not in session. If they are not approved by the legislature within six weeks of its next meeting, they lapse. The Supreme Court (1970) has held that the Ordinance route for law making should be used only under exceptional circumstances, and should not substitute the law-making powers of the legislature. 15 States promulgated 79 Ordinances in 2022. This is much lower than the last two years. States promulgated around 265 Ordinances in 2020, and around 255 in 2021. The high figure is partly due to Kerala issuing 81 Ordinances in 2020 and 144 Ordinances in 2021. In 2022, Kerala promulgated the highest number of Ordinances (15), followed by Maharashtra (13). Meghalaya, which promulgated no Ordinances in 2020, promulgated four in 2021, and ten in 2022. Figure 13: Number of Ordinances promulgated by states in 2022 Note: No Ordinances were promulgated in Sikkim in 2022. Data was not available or could not be confirmed for other states.

Concurrent List subjects include criminal and civil procedure, education, contracts, and administration of justice. This section provides an overview of the laws passed by states in 2022, and the subjects these laws covered. Appropriation and Finance Bills are excluded from this analysis. Figure 14: Subject-wise laws passed by states in 2022 Note: This figure includes all Bills from Figure 10. Others includes Bills on environment, forests, health, justice, religion, revenue, and trade & commerce. Education University Chancellors: In most states, the Governor serves as the ex-officio Chancellor, or administrative head, of state public universities. They have various powers and responsibilities, including the power to appoint individuals to other administrative positions such as the Vice-Chancellor (VC). In 2022, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal passed Bills that amend the role of the Governor in university administration. Kerala passed two Bills replacing the Governor as the ex-officio Chancellor with Chancellors appointed by the state government. 17,18 Tamil Nadu passed Bills that shift the power to appoint the VC from the Chancellor to the state government. 19,20,21,22,23 West Bengal passed laws removing the Governor from administrative roles in universities.24,25,26,27,28,29 These laws replace the Governor with (i) the Chief Minister as the ex-officio Chancellor in public universities, and (ii) the Minister for Higher Education in private universities. A Visitor of a university has powers and responsibilities including annulling decisions of university authorities that contravene legislation establishing them, and inspecting the affairs, records, and facilities of the university. Arunachal Pradesh passed laws appointing the Governor as the Visitor for eight universities. Setting up new universities: Several Bills passed in 2022 sought to establish new universities. Two Bills established National Law Universities in Tripura and Meghalaya.30,31 One established a university in Tamil Nadu for Siddha, Unani, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, and other forms of alternative medicine.32 Maharashtra introduced a Bill establishing a university focusing on skill development.33 Common recruitment body for universities: Telangana passed the Telangana Universities Common Recruitment Board Bill, 2022.34 The Board will recommend persons for direct recruitment to teaching and non- teaching posts in universities and colleges in Telangana, except for medical universities. Appointments will be made on the basis of such recommendations. Law and Justice Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh introduced amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC).35,36,37,38,39,40 The Jharkhand amendment allows for trial in absentia for accused who have been released on bail or bond, but fail to appear after service of summons. The Haryana Bill amends Section 306 of CrPC. This Section provides for tender of pardon of a person accused of being an accomplice to a crime, conditional on their disclosure of facts and other persons involved. Under the CrPC, accomplices accepting such tenders of pardon must be detained for the duration of the trial. The Haryana Bill amends this provision to allow them to be released on bail. The Uttar Pradesh amendment expands the list of offences for which anticipatory bail cannot be sought. These include the offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, offences punishable by death sentence, and offences of rape and illegal sexual intercourse under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Public safety: Gujarat passed the Gujarat Public Safety (Measures) Enforcement Bill, 2022.41 Under this law, an owner or manager operating an establishment with footfall above a notified limit is required to implement 6% 4% 2% 16% 4% 12% 2% 2% 5% 6% 4% 3% 3% 2% 9% 2% 9% 2% 8% 0% 4% 8% 12% 16% 20%Administration &PersonnelAgricultureCooperatives &SocietiesEducationFinanceUrban & MunicipalDevelopmentIndustryInfrastructureLabourLand &RegistrationLaw & OrderLegislatureRuralDevelopmentPublic ServicesRepealSocial JusticeTaxationWaterOthers Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 8 measures (such as CCTV) for the safety of persons visiting such establishments. They will also be required to save the video footage for 30 days and provide it when required by a specified authority. The Bill also provides for a Public Safety Committee which will be empowered to inspect the premises and impose penalties upon a manager or owner for failure to implement public safety measures. Temporary release of prisoners: The Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 2022 provides for the temporary release of prisoners on parole or furlough.42 Parole refers to temporary release from prison upon application, for emergencies, visitation, or any other purpose to be assessed by specified officers. Furlough refers to temporary release on good behaviour, for a period which may be counted towards service of sentence. The Act specifies the procedure and conditions for temporary release, including offences and sentences which render prisoners ineligible for temporary release. Religious conversion: Haryana and Karnataka both passed laws prohibiting conversion of another person to any religion through the use of force, misrepresentation, fraud, or coercion.43,44 Under these laws, all wilful religious conversions including conversions by marriage require the submission of a declaration to the District Magistrate. The District Magistrate must publicly display such declarations for 30 days to invite objections. Religious conversions performed in violation of these laws will be considered illegal. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat had passed similar laws in 2021.45,46,47 Anti-gambling law: Chhattisgarh introduced the Chhattisgarh Gambling (Prohibition) Bill, 2022. 48 This Bill prohibits and punishes gambling in public places, keeping or being in a gambling house, and online gambling. Tamil Nadu also passed the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Online Gambling and Regulation of Online Games Bill, 2022. 49 This Bill prohibits online gambling and online games of chance played for money or any other stakes. It also establishes the Tamil Nadu Online Gaming Authority to regulate online game providers, including prohibition of games of chance. Prohibition of violence against media persons: Goa passed the Goa Media Persons and Media Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Bill, 2022.50 It prohibits and punishes violence against media persons, which include journalists, editors, cartoonists, photojournalists, and individuals in other related professions. Acts of violence against media persons will be non-cognizable, non-bailable offences punishable with up to three years of imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to Rs 50,000. Regulation of business in urban areas: Haryana passed the Haryana Municipal (Amendment) Bill, 2022, which removes licensing requirements for various business activities under the Haryana Municipal Act, 1973 and the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994.51 The Bill removes business activities such as glass cutting and cloth dyeing from those which require licensing. Where the 1994 Act empowered the Commissioner of a Municipal Corporation to determine which activities are dangerous and thus require licensing, the Bill gives this authority to the state government. Further, it shifts the power to decide license fees from the Commissioner to the state government. Health In 2022, Bills relating to health were introduced in seven states - Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.52,53,54,55,56,12,57,58 Of these seven Bills, five were passed. Public health: Rajasthan introduced the Rajasthan Right to Health Bill, 2022.12 This Bill provides every person in the state the right to health and access to healthcare, including free healthcare services. The state government will have certain obligations such as making healthcare services available with due consideration of area and population density, and providing safe drinking water and nutritious food. The Bill provides for the creation of health authorities at the state and district levels to plan, implement, and monitor mechanisms to improve healthcare. This Bill was examined by a Select Committee headed by the state Health Minister. The Goa Public Health (Amendment) Bill, 2022 removes imprisonment as a punishment from various penalties under the Goa Public Health Act, 1985.53 These include failure to comply with the directions of a Health Officer to abate nuisance, and operating an ambulance without a permit. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, a central law, was amended in 2011 to keep up with improvements in medical technology. 59 Haryana passed the Transplantation of Human Organs (Haryana Validation) Act, 2022 to validate actions taken by the state under the 2011 amendments, retrospectively from the date the said amendments came into force.54 Clinical establishments: Kerala and West Bengal introduced Bills amending their respective Clinical Establishment Acts. The Acts provide for the registration of clinical establishments and standards they must adhere to. Kerala amended its Act twice, to extend periods for provisional registration and for the state government to issue notifications to remove difficulties in implementing the Act.55,56 West Bengal passed the West Bengal Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) (Amendment) Bill, 2022, to add the Chief Medical Officer of a Health District as the registering and licensing authority.58 Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 9 Finance Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM): All states have FRBM laws which set limits on the fiscal deficit, revenue deficit, and outstanding liabilities of the state, ensuring that their borrowing is in check. Prior to 2020-21, states were allowed to borrow up to 3% of their Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). In 2020-21, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on government finances, the central government allowed states to borrow up to 5% of their GSDP, under certain conditions.60 This limit was reduced to 4% in 2021-22. For the financial year 2022-23, the central government permitted states to borrow up to 3.5% of their GSDP.61 States were allowed to borrow an additional 0.5% of their GSDP contingent on undertaking certain power sector reforms. The reforms were related to eliminating revenue gap and reducing the technical and commercial losses of state-owned discoms. In 2022, several states including Assam, Bihar, Kerala, and West Bengal amended their respective FRBM Acts to allow for this additional borrowing space.62,63,64,65,66 Assam increased its outstanding debt targets from 28.5% of GSDP to 32% for the next five years starting from 2022-23. Karnataka set a 3.5% limit for their fiscal deficit for 2022-23. Kerala set a target to reduce their fiscal deficit to 3% by the year 2026. For 2022-23, West Bengal set the maximum fiscal deficit target at 4% of GSDP. Assam, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, and West Bengal amended their respective laws to increase the total corpus of their Contingency Funds.67,68,69,70 Article 267(2) of the Constitution allows state legislatures to establish a Contingency Fund to meet any unforeseen expenditure.71 Taxation: Assam, Karnataka, and Telangana passed laws related to taxation on motor vehicles.72,73,74 Assam amended the law to introduce a green tax to be paid by all transport vehicles older than 10 years, and all non- transport vehicles older than 15 years. This tax will have to be paid at the time of renewal of fitness certificates, which is required every five years in case of non-transport vehicles. Further, 75% of the motor vehicle tax will have to be paid at the time of vehicle registration, and the remaining within five years. The Karnataka amendment provides for payment of advance tax on motor vehicles within a month from the due date on a quarterly, half yearly or yearly basis. The Act provided for this payment to be done within 15 days.75 The Telangana Bill defines cost of a vehicle to include the basic manufacturing cost of motor vehicle manufactured in India and excise duty, sales tax or GST on it. Goa amended the Goa Tax on Infrastructure Act, 2009.76 The Act provides for levying a tax on construction of infrastructure on residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. It penalises contravention of the provisions of the Act with imprisonment up to one year, and/or a fine twice the amount of tax payable. The amendment removes the provision for imprisonment and retains the fine liability.77 Local Governance Municipal governance: Tamil Nadu passed several Bills to establish new municipal corporations in cities.78,79,80,81,82,83 The state also passed the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning (Second Amendment) Bill, 2022, which introduced Urban Planning Areas and Urban Development Agencies (UDAs). 84 These Areas will be notified by the state, and UDAs will be responsible for surveying such areas. Their responsibilities also include developing a Master Plan which governs land use in notified Areas, and implementing this plan. UDAs will be comprised of members including a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman, three state government officers, one state legislator, the UDA’s chief planner, and local authority representatives. The state also passed the Tamil Nadu Urban Local Bodies (Amendment) Bill, 2022.85 This Bill amends the frequency of delimitation of wards for elections to urban local bodies from five years to ten years, in order to coincide with the last census. Under the Bill, chairpersons of Municipal Councils are elected by council members from among themselves, whereas they were earlier elected directly by voters on the electoral roll. The Bill increases the proportion of council seats and offices of mayors and chairpersons reserved for women from one third to half the number of seats. It also gives the state government the power to remove councillors and chairpersons from office, instead of the council itself removing members by voting or resolution. Assam passed the Assam Municipal Corporation Bill, 2022. 86 Under this Bill, the Governor may declare an area to be a Municipal Corporation based on its population density, the revenue generated for local administration, economic importance, and the percentage of the population employed in agriculture, among other factors. The Bill also provides for the constitution of a Corporation, its functions and regulatory jurisdiction, elections to the Corporation, and taxation powers. Transport planning authorities: Karnataka and Assam passed laws creating authorities to plan and manage urban transport. 87,88 This objective was set by the National Urban Transport Policy, 2006. 89 The Assam Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority Bill, 2022, establishes a single Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) to plan urban transport in cities in Assam. The UMTA will prepare a Comprehensive Mobility Plan for areas within its jurisdiction and be responsible for approving transport projects. Similarly, Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 10 Karnataka passed the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority Bill, 2022. It creates the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority, to perform similar functions for the Bengaluru Metropolitan Area. Labour and Employment Labour regulation: Assam amended its laws regulating building and construction workers, beedi and cigar workers and migrant workmen.90,91,92 The amendment to the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Service) Act, 1996 removed provisions for imprisonment for violations under the Act. The Beedi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1966 was amended to increase the fine and imprisonment term. The Plantations Labour Act, 1951 (central law), which regulates plantation workers and provides for their welfare, penalises obstruction in the work of an inspector with a fine of up to Rs 10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six months.93 Assam amended the penalty to a fine between Rs 50,000 and one lakh rupees. Continued contraventions will lead to imprisonment of up to three months and a further increase in penalty, or both. 94, Labour welfare fund: Andhra Pradesh, Goa, and Kerala amended their laws related to labour welfare funds. 95,96,97,98,99,100 Goa’s amendment Bill provides for compounding of offences committed by an employer by paying up to 75% of the maximum fine for an offence. Compounding is not applicable to cases where the penalty includes imprisonment, second offences, or if the offence was committed less than five years ago. Kerala’s amendment to the Kerala Motor Transport Workers’ Welfare Fund Act, 1985 expanded the definition of an employee to include workers such as autorickshaw drivers, electricians, mechanics, carpenters, and motor vehicle maintenance workers in automobile workshops. 101 It also amended the Kerala Document Writers’ Scribes’ and Stamp Vendors’ Welfare Fund Act, 2012 to provide for a one-time settlement to revive the membership of members who have defaulted on the payment towards the fund.102 Social Justice Welfare of SCs and STs: Rajasthan enacted the Rajasthan State Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Development Fund (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Bill, 2022.103 It provides that the state must earmark a certain amount in the annual budget towards the Scheduled Castes (SC) Development Fund and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) Development Fund. Karnataka passed the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Services Under the State) Bill, 2022.104 It provides for reservation of seats in educational institutions and appointments or posts in services to be 17% for SCs and 7% for STs. Services include the government, state legislature, local authorities and corporations or companies owned by the state government. Benefits to state residents: Jharkhand passed the Local People and the Resulting Social, Cultural and Other Benefits Bill, 2022 providing for special provisions to residents of Jharkhand.105 Residents will be beneficiaries of the state’s policies on social security, insurance, and employment. They will also be entitled to special rights and security on land, employment, and loans. Preferential treatment will be given to them for trade and commerce, especially for traditional and cultural enterprises. Reservation in public employment: Jharkhand passed the Jharkhand Reservation in Vacancies of Posts and Services (Amendment) Bill, 2022 which increased the cumulative reservations in public employment and education in the state from 60% to 77%.106 The Bill increased the percentage of reservations for OBCs from 14% to 27%, for SCs from 10 to 12% and for STs from 26 to 28%.107 It also introduced 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). This Bill is pending assent from the Governor. Jharkhand also passed the Jharkhand Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation to the Posts in the State Services Bill, 2022.108 The Bill provides that SC/ST officers may be promoted to the non-reserved seats as well, in case of vacancies and on the basis of merit criteria that will be specified. Land Land ownership: Andhra Pradesh passed a law for the establishment, administration, and management of land titles.109 The Bill provides for setting up of the Andhra Pradesh Land Authority which will create a record of all immovable properties in a notified area. Each of these records will contain the record of title (or ownership) over the respective property, and the boundaries of the property. These records will be published by the Title Registration Officer. The Bill also provides for the mechanism to determine titles in case of any disputes. Assam amended the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act, 1886 to incorporate provisions from two other laws, while repealing them. 110 These are the Assam Gramdan Act, 1961 and the Assam Bhoodan Act, 1965, which provided for the donation of land by landowners. The Bill states that the rights and liabilities of the Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 11 grantees under both the Acts will not be affected and they will be deemed to be the land holder or the settlement holder. Land regulation: Punjab amended the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961, which provides for regulating rights in the shamlat deh areas that include land owned by the village panchayat and used for village community purposes.111 The Bill added that these will also include lands which were reserved for common purposes under the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948 and were under the management and control of the Gram Panchayat under the 1961 Act. The Assam Fixation of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Bill, 2022 provides for the use of 5% of total tea garden area to be used for eco-tourism, animal husbandry, green power, and social infrastructure.112 This is over and above the provisions of the Act that allow the use of land exceeding 50 bighas for various purposes.113 Regularisation of unauthorised development: Gujarat passed the Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorised Development Bill, 2022. 114 This law allows owners or occupiers who have been ordered to remove or alter an unauthorised development to apply for regularisation of the property, by paying a fee. Such applications may be refused if unauthorised developments take place on certain types of land, such as government-owned land, or if it contravenes other regulations such as the fire safety law. The Himachal Pradesh Slum Dwellers (Proprietary Rights) Bill, 2022, was also passed in 2022.115 It confers proprietary rights upon people defined as slum dwellers, who are landless people living in poorly built or temporary settlements with at least 15 households. Eligibility for such rights requires that a slum dweller’s living parents have not been conferred similar rights, and that they are in occupation within the slum area. The Bill entitles each slum dweller to be considered for being granted proprietary rights to up to 75 square meters of land. While these rights are inheritable, they are not transferable by lease, sale, or other means. Protecting public utilities: Haryana passed a Bill that prohibits disturbing or demolishing public utilities on any land to the detriment of public interest or public use.116 Public utilities include roads, paths, public health works, drains, public institutions, and any facility which is being used or has been used by the public or for public benefit. If a person contravenes such provisions, they may be punished with imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000, or both. The cost incurred for restoration of public utilities may be recovered from the violator. Land Revenue: Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan, and Tripura amended their land revenue laws.117,118,119,120,121,122,123 The Himachal Pradesh amendment empowers the Financial Commissioner to examine the record of any land record case pending or instituted before him. The Himachal Pradesh Land Revenue Act, 1954 empowered the Financial Commissioner as well as the Collectors and Commissioners to take up such land record cases.124 The Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code (Amendment) Bill 2022 creates new posts of District Survey Officer and Deputy Survey Officer. It provides for the exclusion of soil classification from revenue surveys and instead requires field books be prepared for all. The Bill also requires the tehsildar to provide details regarding land records on the e-namantran portal and inform the interested parties regarding the same. In case of a dispute, the details have to be registered under the e-revenue court from the e-namantran portal. Karnataka amended the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 to extend the time to apply for regularisation of unauthorised occupation of government land.125 The Act empowers the government to form taluk committees to deal with these land grant cases. Prohibition of land grabbing: Gujarat and Karnataka amended their laws on the prohibition of land grabbing. 126,127 The Gujarat Act provides for constitution of special courts to try cases of land grabbing. The amendment provides that appeals against orders of the special court will lie with the High Court. It also provides that land types as given in the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 will be excluded from the purview of Land Grabbing Act, 2020. The Karnataka Bill amends the Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition Act, 2011, which prohibits land grabbing and provides for punishment for contravening its provisions.127,128 The 2011 Act defines land to include (i) land belonging to the state government and entities managed by it, local authorities, religious authorities, and charitable organisations, and (ii) rights over land, property attached to it, and benefits arising from it. The Bill amends the first part of the definition above to extend this to land within the limits of municipal corporations in Karnataka, including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Administration and personnel Commissions for appointments: Kerala passed the Kerala Public Enterprises (Selection and Recruitment) Board Bill, 2022, which will prepare a select list for appointment of candidates to various posts other than appointment made through the Kerala Public Service Commission.129 It will also recommend candidates for the post of Managing Director or Head of the PSUs under the Industries and Commerce Department. Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 12 Raising of retirement age: Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Telangana passed laws raising retirement ages for various posts. The Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Regulation of Superannuation) (Amendment) Bill, 2022, for example, raised retirement age for government employees in Andhra Pradesh from 60 to 62.130 Official language: The Andhra Pradesh Official Languages (Amendment) Bill, 2022 adds Urdu as a second official language across Andhra Pradesh.131 The Tamil Nadu Government Servants (Conditions of Service) Amendment Act, 2020, in addition to modifying other features of entrance exams conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, adds Tamil as a language for these exams.132 This is in addition to English. Agriculture Agricultural produce and marketing: Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Jharkhand, and Telangana amended their laws on agricultural produce and livestock marketing. 133,134,135,136 The Andhra Pradesh law enabled additional contribution to their Central Market Fund for building better infrastructure for their agriculture and agriculture marketing activities. Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Tripura made amendments to their Acts regulating agricultural markets.137,138,139,140 These states regulate their agricultural markets through the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs). The APMCs are used to regulate agriculture produce in states. The Punjab amendment provided that all previously nominated committees will cease to exist and will be reconstituted within one year. Rajasthan’s amendment empowered the market committees to collect user charges for buying/selling non-notified agricultural produce and food products. Mizoram enacted a new law to regulate their agriculture produce markets.141 It empowers the government to establish/close markets, collect rent for stalls, and regulate the price of meat, vegetables, and fruits. It also provides for penalties if persons contravene the provisions related to market regulation. A person selling agriculture produce above the maximum retail rate, will be punished with a fine extending up to Rs 1,000 or imprisonment of up to three months, or both. Irrigation: Assam and Goa amended their irrigation laws to decriminalise punishments for offences under these laws, but increased monetary fines.142,143,144,145 The offences include damage or any type of obstruction to irrigation work. Legislatures Modification of salaries and other benefits: Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh passed laws relating to salaries, pensions, and other benefits for legislators and government officers. For example, Maharashtra passed a Bill which gives the state government the power to specify salaries of personal assistants to MLAs, and Ministers in the state government. The amendment provides that these salaries will be determined by an order of the state government instead of legislation. 146 Annual Review of State Laws 2022 PRS Legislative Research 13 NOTE ON SOURCES AND METHODOLOGY Sources This report is based on data from 28 states and two union territories with legislatures. Data was gathered from six types of sources: (i) Resumes or synopses of Assembly sessions, which are typically published a few weeks after the end of a session, and provide details of all activities carried out during the session; (ii) Sitting-wise Bulletins (summary of business transacted), and Proceedings; (iii) summary documents available on state legislature websites; (iv) responses to Right to Information requests; (v) state gazette publications; and (vi) documents received through direct communication with the state legislature research officials or secretariat. Each data point was verified across multiple sources. Methodology ‘Sitting days’ is defined as the number of calendar days for which a House sat in one session. If a House sat for two sittings in a day, it is treated as a single sitting day. For the States/UTs which are not included in Figure 5, historical data on sittings was either unavailable or could not be verified. Budget sessions have been identified as those in which the annual Budget was presented. Typically, states have one budget session in a year. However, some states passed a Vote on Account (approval of expenditure for part of the financial year) in one session and the full budget in the next. For these states, the session in which the full budget was passed has been considered as the Budget Session. Sitting days only capture how frequently Assemblies meet and do not give any information about how long they worked on each day. The average duration of a sitting for the legislature has either been compiled from statistical statements, or computed from daily bulletins or complete proceedings. For states not mentioned in Figure 3, time spent on sittings could not be computed. Total number of Bills passed was determined from session resumes and bulletins. Each Bill and Act is numbered chronologically, and this series was used to identify gaps, if any. However, states follow different conventions for numbering Bills and Acts, and Bill and Act copies could not be located for some states. For instance, Kerala includes, in the same series, Bills that are published in the gazette but not introduced in the House. Bill numbers were not available for all Assam Bills. This analysis does not consider Appropriation Bills and Finance Bills, and includes only those Bills which were passed by the Legislature in 2022. The analysis of the time taken for passing a Bill (Figure 11) and the time taken for a Bill to receive the Governor’s assent (Figure 12) is based on the dates of introduction, passing, and assent of the Bill. For states with Assembly as well as Council, the date of introduction for a Bill is the date on which it was introduced in the first House. The date of passage is the date on which the Bill was passed in the second House. However, this exercise could be performed only for four out of the six states with bicameral legislatures. Since no data was available on the functioning of the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh Legislative Councils, the Assembly introduction and passage dates have been considered for these states. As with sitting days, the time interval between the introduction and passing of Bills does not reflect the quality of legislative scrutiny. This could be measured using various other indicators such as the actual time taken to discuss a Bill in the House, the details of the debate on a Bill, and the number of Members who participated in the debate. However, unlike Parliament, most states do not publish complete proceedings or detailed information on Bill debates. Kerala, in its session resume, releases information on debates, including the number of amendment motions moved. In other states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Goa, these details can be extracted from the proceedings of the House. Data on budgets was obtained from the same sources as above. While dates of the budget presentation and discussion were easily available, the duration of the discussion could not be obtained for most states. The number of demands (Ministry budgets) actually discussed in the House, and the number guillotined (passed without voting) could also not be ascertained for most states. However, these indicators provide important insights into the functioning of the state legislature. The primary challenge in the data collection and verification process was the inconsistent manner in which State Assemblies publish data. Some states do not regularly update their websites or the National eVidhan Application (a central initiative to collate information on all legislatures). Data on the indicators chosen here was not available for all states/UTs. In a few cases, news reports were relied on to address gaps. Discrepancies between official documents were also found, which lengthened the verification process. The availability of documents only in regional languages in some states increased the difficulty of collecting and verifying the data.
