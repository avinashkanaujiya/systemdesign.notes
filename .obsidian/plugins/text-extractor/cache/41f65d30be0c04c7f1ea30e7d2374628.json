The study , published in the journal Nature , reveals a more complex organic geochemical cycle on Mars than previously thought , indicating the presence of multiple reservoirs of potential organic molecules on the planet. Key Findings: The findings suggest that Mars has experienced aqueous processes and that water may have played a significant role in the existence of organic matter . The research team used an instrument called the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) to detect the organic compounds. The rover ’s landing site in Jezero Crater , which was once a lake basin, shows a high potential for past habitability , as it contains minerals such as carbonates, clays, and sulphates that could preserve organic compounds and traces of prehistoric life.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
