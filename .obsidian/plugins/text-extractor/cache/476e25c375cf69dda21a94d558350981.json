Child Malnutrition Introduction • Health is a crucial indicator of a country’s development. • Widespread malnutrition among Indian children is a potent factor denting India’s overall progress. • A sound foundation in the childhood days is extremely crucial for the overall development of a human being. Global Hunger Index (GHI) • The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022, is based on cases of stunting, wasting, and deaths among Indian children. • It placed India at 107th rank among 121 countries. • India’s child-wasting rate is 19.3%, the highest in the world. Child Malnutrition Status • Child Wasting is caused by inadequate calorie intake, malabsorption of nutrients, altered metabolic rate and hormone deficiency. • 69% of India’s under-five child mortality cases in 2022 were due to malnutrition. • 4 out of 10 children in India do not meet their full human potential because of chronic undernutrition or stunting. Consequences of malnutrition • Malnutrition results in a reduced ability to work and increased susceptibility to diseases. • Chronic malnutrition can impair a young child’s physical and mental development. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Cognitive impairment resulting from malnutrition may result in diminished productivity in academic performance. • India loses 4% of its GDP annually due to malnourishment. Concerns / Challenges • Important nutrition programmes are underfunded. • Malnutrition among children would ultimately impact not just the health of the next generation of Indians but also the economy. • Inequities in food and health systems increase inequalities in nutrition outcomes that in turn can lead to more inequity, perpetuating a vicious cycle. • Many of the anganwadis in the villages have been non-functional and anganwadi workers are not receiving their salary on time. Government Initiatives • Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) provides a supplemental nutrition programme, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-ups, and health referrals. • POSHAN Abhiyaan promotes nutrition among children, pregnant women, and nursing moms. • National Creche Scheme and Saksham Anganwadi and Mission POSHAN 2.0 • Food Fortification. • National Food Security Act, 2013 • Mission Indradhanush Way Forward • The Central and state governments need to ensure every child gets proper nutrition. • Emphasise on nutrition literacy in Indian schools. • Need for a farming system for nutrition (FSN) intervention. • This system integrates crop, livestock and allied agricultural practices and nutrition literacy to tackle malnutrition among Indian children. • The convergence of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission with schemes pertaining to nutrition, will bring holistic changes to India’s nutrition scenario. Conclusion • Action is needed now to root out malnutrition among children. • Failing on this front would be a self-inflicted disaster.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
