Right-based healthcare Introduction • Healthcare provisions in India is grossly inadequate and access to healthcare is highly inequitable. • India’s health sector needs extensive infrastructure support. • The legislative bodies across India have debated the need for a ‘Right to Health’ bill to prioritize health concerns. Constitutional Provisions • Recently the Supreme Court expanded the definition of the Right to Life and said, it is the duty of the state to ensure the right to health. • Article 47 of the Directive Principles also call for the provision of “maternity relief\" and “public assistance in case of disablement. Some recent achievements • India achieved a Total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.1 (replacement level) in 2020. • 74% of Indians are either covered or eligible for health insurance coverage. • Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme (2018) provides insurance against hospitalisation for up to Rs 5 lakh per year per family. Challenges faced by India’s healthcare system • India’s doctor-to-patient ratio is about 1:1,511 for allopathic doctors, against the WHO norm of 1:1,000. • The nurse-to-population ratio is at 1:670 against the norm of 1:300. • National Family Health Survey-5 reveals that 49% of Indian households do not use government facilities due to long waiting times. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Out-of-pocket expenditure as a proportion of total health expenditure is still very high at 48.2%. • Rural-urban disparity in healthcare infrastructure. • Health as a policy intervention has always been measured in terms of ‘outputs’ and not ‘outcomes.’ Demand-supply mismatch • The real issue is a demand-supply mismatch. • India’s lack of infrastructure capacity, both at the physical and human resource levels. • Even if Right to Health provision is introduced, it will create demand that cannot be met with a meagre supply of health services. • The health outlay in the Union Budget for 2023-24 saw only a 3.3% increase. Odisha’s approach • Odisha’s approach has been to transform primary health centres, and open new medical colleges to increase the capacity of healthcare staff. • The state’s Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana aims to ensure universal healthcare to every family, whether above or below the poverty line. • Even for patients outside Odisha, more than 200 hospitals have been impanelled. • This was achieved by making provisions in the state budget and not leaving the responsibility to insurance companies. Way Forward • Protecting and investing in people’s health, education, and skilling is vital for reducing income inequality, and sustained inclusive economic growth. • As recommended by the National Health Policy 2017, India needs to increase its spending on health to at least 2.5 % of GDP respectively from its current levels. • India must focus on providing universal healthcare through public infrastructure and chart out a systematic framework to achieve it.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
