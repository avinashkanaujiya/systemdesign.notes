In light of the statement, evaluate the role played by judicial activism in achieving the ideals of democracy. [12.5/ 200] Judicial activism 2015 Resorting to ordinances has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation of power doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to promulgate, analyse whether the decision of the Supreme Court on the issue have further facilitated to resorting to this power. Should the power to promulgate the ordinances be repealed?

Theory 2020 Judicial Legislation is antithetical to the doctrine of separation of powers as envisaged in the Indian Constitution. In this context justify the filing of large number of public interest petitions praying for issuing guidelines to executive authorities. Theory FOCUS AREAS ➢ Separation of Powers & Checks and Balances ➢ Ordinances ➢ Tribunals ➢ Judicial Review & Activism, PIL (Only in PDF File) ➢ ADR (Only in PDF File) ➢ Lok-Adalats (Only in PDF File) ➢Montesquieu who for the first time gave it a systematic and scientific formulation in his book 'Esprit des Lois (The Spirit of the laws) published in the year 1748. ➢The Executive should not exercise the legislative or judicial powers because this may threaten the freedom and liberty of individuals. ➢The Legislative should never exercise the executive or judicial powers as this may lead to arbitrariness and hence, end the liberty. ➢The Judiciary should not exercise the executive or legislative powers because then a judge would behave like a dictator. ➢ INTRODUCTION ➢ Aristotle, in his book ‘Politics’, discussed the concept of separation of powers stating that every constitution should have a heterogeneous form of government consisting of mainly three branches: the deliberative, public officials and the judiciary. ➢ Montesquieu described division of political powers among an executive, a legislature, and a judiciary. ➢ He based this model on the British Constitutional system, in which he perceived a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law. ➢ The Constitution recognizes of the three-fold functional division of governmental powers. ➢ Article 50 expressly requires the State to apply the principle of separation of the judiciary from the executive as a sound principle of Government. (FOR ESSAY) SEPARATION OF POWERS Objectives of Separation of Powers • Firstly, it aims to eliminate arbitrariness, totalitarianism and tyranny and promote an accountable and democratic form of government. • Secondly, it prevents the misuse of powers within the different organs of the government. The Indian Constitution provides certain limits and boundaries for each domain of the government and they are supposed to perform their function within such limits. In India, the Constitution is the ultimate sovereign and if anything goes beyond the provisions of the constitution, it will automatically be considered as null, void and unconstitutional. • Thirdly, it keeps a check on all the branches of the government by making them accountable for themselves. • Fourthly, separation of powers maintains a balance among the three organs of government by dividing the powers among them so that powers do not concentrate on any one branch leading to arbitrariness. • Fifthly, this principle allows all the branches to specialize themselves in their respective field with an intention to enhance and improve the efficiency of the government. SEPARATION OF POWERS Separation of Powers - U.K. Constitution • The United Kingdom practices the unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy. • The concept of separation of powers is applied in the UK but not in its rigid sense because the UK has an unwritten constitution. • The Parliament is the sovereign rule-making body in the UK. • The government is answerable to the Parliament. Practically, the executive is controlled by the House of Commons. • The Judiciary, however, is independent of executive control. But the judges of the Supreme Court can be removed on the address of both the houses if found with any charge of corruption. SEPARATION OF POWERS Separation of Powers - U.S. Constitution • The US has a written constitution and governed by the Presidential form of government • This concept is well-defined and clear under the American Constitution. • The President and his ministers are the executive authority and they are not members of the Congress. • The ministers are accountable to the President only and not to the Congress. • The tenure of the President is fixed and independent of the majority in Congress. • Congress is the sovereign legislative authority. It consists of two houses- Senate and House of Representative. • The impeachment of the President can be done by Congress. • The treaties entered by the President are to be approved by the Senate. The Supreme Court of the USA is independent. • It may declare any action of the executive as well as the legislature as unconstitutional if found so. SEPARATION OF POWERS • President interferes in the functioning of Congress by exercising his veto power. He also makes the appointment of the Judges thus, interfering in judicial powers. • Similarly, Congress interferes in the powers of the Courts by passing procedural laws, making special courts and by approving the appointment of the judges. • The judiciary, by exercising the power of judicial review interferes in the powers of Congress and the President. SEPARATION OF POWERS Critical analysis: The Indian perspective – Constitutional provisions • The Indian Constitution does not expressly mention the theory of separation of powers. In fact, the Constituent Assembly Debates indicate that separation of powers in its rigid or literal sense was never intended to be adopted by the constitution makers at all. • This was evident when the insertion of a new Article 40-A, that prescribed a complete separation of powers between the three branches, to the Constitution was proposed by Prof. K T Shah in the Constituent Assembly. • Dr. B.R Ambedkar, while acknowledging the separation of the executive from the judiciary, emphasized upon the importance of interdependence between the executive and legislature for the proper functioning of their complicated duties in the government. SEPARATION OF POWERS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS SUPPORTING SOP • Distinct institutions and core powers • Under Articles 53(1) and 154 of the Constitution, the executive powers of the Union and States have been expressly vested in the President and the Governor respectively. • Article 245 vests the Central and State lawmaking authority to the Parliament and State Legislatures respectively, empowering the Parliament to make laws for the whole country • Article 50 categorically prescribes the separation of the executive from the judiciary under the Indian governmental structure. Hence, an apparent demarcation between the three branches and their functions is found to be broadly laid out under the Constitution. SEPARATION OF POWERS • Autonomy and independence • Articles 122 and 212 of the Constitution avert the Courts from inquiring into the proceedings of the Parliament and State legislatures respectively. • Articles 105 and 194 confer judicial immunity to the MPs and MLAs from anything spoken during their sessions • Article 361, the President and Governor are also not accountable to the Courts for exercise of their powers and duties in the office • the Supreme and High Court judges are also immune from a scrutiny of their conduct in the Parliament or State Legislature (Articles 121 and 211 SEPARATION OF POWERS Provisions leaning against a pure separation of powers • Overlapping personnel • The Indian governmental structure is such that there is a commonality of personnel between the two organs, with the Union Council of Ministers being members of both the Parliament (Article 75) as well as the executive (Article 74). • Even the President is regarded as part of the Legislature along with the Houses of the Parliament (Article 79). • Overlapping powers (E & L) • There is also a commonality of powers between the two organs, with the powers of the executive prescribed as co- extensive to that of the legislature (Article 74) • The executive exercises legislative powers when it comes to the President’s authority to issue ordinances when the Houses of the Parliament are not in session, which is considered equivalent to a Parliamentary Act (Article 123) • The President’s assent is required for the passing of bills proposed by the legislature (Article 111). The President also exercises legislative functions during the proclamation of State Emergency (Article 356), where he has the authority to make laws for the state upon the dissolution of the State Legislature • Moreover, the very concept of delegated legislation is based on the conferment of legislative powers to the executive. This delegation is carried out in the name of administrative adjudication of the rights of the citizens and is implicitly allowed by the Constitution (Articles 372 and 13) • The Council of Ministers is also collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, indicating another overlap between the two organs (Article 75). • Hence, it has been said that there is a fusion between the executive and the legislative in India, but without any friction occurring between them. SEPARATION OF POWERS • Overlapping powers (E & J ) • The President is empowered to grant pardon, reprieve, respite or remise to the sentence of any person convicted by Supreme Court of India, representing a judicial power (Article 72). • The President also performs a judicial act in resolving disputes relating to the age of judges of the courts as regards their retirement from judicial office (Articles 124(2)(a) and 217(3)). • On the other hand, the judiciary exercises executive functions under Article 227 of the Constitution wherein the High Courts have been granted the power of supervision over subordinate courts. • Further, they carry out other administrative functions such as the transfer of cases under Article 228. • Overlapping powers (L & J) • The Parliament also performs judicial functions such as punishing its members or outsiders for contempt or breach of parliamentary privilege. • The judiciary, on the other hand, performs legislative functions in laying down rules and procedures for court proceedings and practice (Article 145). SEPARATION OF POWERS Checks & Balances • The Parliament has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President and exercises a check on his activities (Article 61). • The Parliament and President together have the power to remove judges of the Supreme Court (Article 124) and High Courts (Article 217) and the President further possesses the power to appoint the judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court (Article 124 and 217). • Most importantly, the power of judicial review possessed by the Courts under Articles 32, 226 and 136 reflects a paradigm of checks and balances, as it allows the Courts to strike down the laws of the Parliament or actions of the executive that are adjudged unconstitutional SEPARATION OF POWERS Judicial Approach towards Separation of Power in India ➢ Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab : The Constitution of India has not acknowledged the doctrine of separation of power emphatically but the functions and powers of all the organs have been adequately distinguished. India’s constitutional structure sufficiently differentiates the functions and branches of the Government to prevent the assumption of functions of one organ by another. ➢ In the Re Delhi Laws Act case – it was highlighted how the British Parliamentary system adopted by India entails the responsibility of the executive to the legislature as its essential feature, and does not strictly follow the doctrine. ➢ Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain : A rigid sense of separation of powers which has been given under the American and Australian constitution does not apply to India. The separation of power is a part of the basic structure of the constitution. So, the schemes of the constitution cannot be changed even after restoring Article 368 of the Indian Constitution ➢ Golak Nath v. State of Punjab : All the organs must function within the spheres allotted to them by the constitution. No authority which is created by the constitution is supreme. SEPARATION OF POWERS CRITICISM OF SOP • It is extraordinarily difficult to distinguish the powers of the legislature, executive and judiciary precisely. A smooth and stable government can exist only if there is cooperation among the three organs. Any attempt made to separate these organs into watertight compartments may lead to failure and inefficiency in the government. • If this concept is adopted in its totality, then it will become impossible to take certain actions. Consequently, neither the legislature can delegate the law making power to the executive which may have expertise in the subject matter, nor the courts can make laws related to the functioning of courts and proceedings. • In the present scenario, a state works for the welfare and prosperity of the people. It has to resolve the complex issues of society. In such circumstances, the principle of separation of power seems to be impossible. The imposition of this doctrine in its rigid conception will not lead to the effectuation of the objectives of the modern state. Thus, separation of power is theoretically improbable and practically impossible. • Montesquieu, by propounding this theory aimed to protect and safeguard the freedom and liberty of the individuals which is impossible by the strict enforcement of separation of powers. SEPARATION OF POWERS Conclusion • The doctrine of separation of powers must be interpreted in a relative form. In the era of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation, separation of power must be expounded in a wider perspective. It should not be curb to the principle of restraint or strict classification only but a group power exercised in the spirit of cooperation, coordination and in the interest of the welfare of the state. SEPARATION OF POWERS Ordinances in the News • The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 : CBI Director Tenure for 5 Years • The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021: Director tenure for 5 years • The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 Drafting error ➢ An ordinance is a law that is promulgated by the President of India, on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet, when the Parliament is not in session. ➢ Similarly, the Governor of a state can also initiate ordinances when a Legislative Assembly is not in session when it is a unicameral legislature and when Legislative Assembly along with Legislative Council both are not in session when itis a bicameral legislature. ➢ Article 123 of the Constitution grants the President the power to promulgate Ordinances. ➢ This technique of issuing an ordinance has been devised with a view to enabling the executive to meet any unforeseen or urgent situation arising in the country when Parliament is not in session, and which it cannot deal with under the ordinary law. ➢ Adopted from Government of India Act, 1935 which vested parallel legislative power in the governor-general of India. ➢ The duration of an ordinance was highly criticized in the constituent assembly debates INTRODUCTION ORDINANCES ORDINANCES RELATED DATA ➢ Between 1952-2014, governments issued 637 ordinances; that averages out to 11 per year or almost one ordinance a month. ➢ About 70 ordinances between 1952 to 1964 ➢ 77 Ordinances during 1971-77 ➢ 2021 : 10, 2020 : 14, 2019 : 16, 2018 : 9, 2017 : 7, 2016 : 10, 2015 : 9, 2014 : 9, 2013 : 11, 2012 : 1 ➢ First recorded Ordinance : The Indian Paper Currency ordinance, 1918 ➢ First Ordinance of Independent India : The Press (Special Powers) No.2) Ordinance, 1947 (Gov Gen) ➢ First Ordinance post Enforcement of Constitution : The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Ordinance, 1950. ORDINANCES ORDINANCE MAKING POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDINANCES COMPARISON BETWEEN REGULAR LEGISLATION AND AN ORDINANCE ➢ An Ordinance made by the President is a legislative act and not an executive act. Hence, itis a ‘law 'within the meaning of Constitution. This power of the President is Co-extensive with the legislative power of the Parliament itself. An Ordinance, therefore, cannot be promulgated with respect to a subject which is beyond the legislative competence of Parliament. ➢ While the initiative for both an Ordinance and regular legislation comes from the Executive, the former is passed on a current basis and in case of the latter, the legislative sanction is postfacto. ➢ Unlike the passing of a regular bill, there is no scope for detailed discussion and arriving at consensus at the time of promulgation of Ordinances. ➢ Like money bills and finance bills, there can be Ordinance on fiscal matters as well. ➢ An Ordinance is also subject to judicial review on grounds of unconstitutionality. Courts have held that the motives of promulgating an Ordinance cannot be questioned in a Court of law, much like the act of the Legislature in passing a law. A Court may only declare an Ordinance invalid in case it transgresses the constitutional limits of the power ORDINANCES SC & Ordinances RC Cooper v. Union of India (1970) • If an ordinance is passed in a circumstance that failed to pass as one requiring ‘immediate action’, the same could be brought to the court of law to be tested for its constitutionality. • 44 CA 1978 : President’s satisfaction not judicially reviewable Dr. D. C. Wadhwa v. State of Bihar (1987) • Mechanical re-promulgation of the ordinances unconstitutional unless was urgent or due to paucity of time Krishna Kumar Singh v State of Bihar (2017) (7 Judge Constitution Bench) • Requirement of placing the ordinance before the Legislature is mandatory • It was further held that any act, right, privilege, obligation or liability to survive after an ordinance has ceased to operate, must satisfy three tests: • That the effect of the ordinance is irreversible; • That reversing the consequence of the ordinance is impractical; • That there is a compelling public interest to continue the effect of the ordinance. ORDINANCES ORDINANCES AN ABUSE OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY? ➢ The Ordinance making power of the President is in reality a power vested with the Union Cabinet or the Council of Ministers. Moreover, the satisfaction of the President regarding the existence of circumstances that render it necessary for him to take immediate action is a subjective matter which cannot be probed or questioned in a court of law; and the precise nature of the action that he may decide to take in such circumstances is also left to his discretion and cannot be challenged. This is similar to the principle that the judiciary cannot examine the reason or motivation to enact a legislation by the Legislature, but merely comment on its constitutional validity. ➢ The increase in the number of ordinances promulgated by the Government has sparked the debate on the use of ordinances to undermine the democratic process of legislating. ➢ The Courts have, in various decisions clarified the power of making Ordinances. In D.C. Wadhwa & others v/s State of Bihar (1986),the Supreme Court made following observations: ➢ The power to promulgate an Ordinance is an emergency power which may be used where immediate action may be necessary at a time when the legislature is not in session. It is contrary to all democratic norms that the Executive should have the power to make a law; hence such emergency power must, of necessity, be limited in point of time. ➢ A constitutional authority cannot do indirectly what it is not permitted to do directly. If there is a constitutional provision inhibiting the authority to do an act, to avoid that limitation by resorting to a subterfuge would be a fraud on the constitutional provision. ORDINANCES ➢ While the satisfaction of the President as to the existence of circumstances necessitating immediate action by issuing an Ordinance cannot be examined by Court, it is competent for the Court to inquire whether he has exceeded the limits imposed by the Constitution. He would be usurping the function of the Legislature if he, in disregard of the constitutional limitations, goes on re-promulgating the same Ordinance successively, for years together, without bringing it before the legislature. ➢ Though, in general the motive behind issuing an Ordinance cannot be questioned, the Court cannot allow it to be ‘perverted for political ends’. ➢ The Court in this case also made it abundantly clear that repeated re-promulgation of ordinances was unconstitutional. ➢ An ordinance is not permanent. It is a stop gap measure for matters that need urgent attention when the Legislature is not in session. However, the motivation to use the power of promulgating Ordinances vested in the President and the Governors under Articles 123 and 213 of the Constitution is generally a result of one of the following three reasons: ➢ Reluctance to face the legislature on particular issues. ➢ Fear of defeat in the Upper House where the government may lack the required numbers. ➢ The need to overcome standoff in the legislature caused by repeated and willful disruption by a section of the Opposition. ➢ In Krishna Kumar Singh v/s State of Bihar (2017), a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court stated that the failure to place an ordinance before the legislature constitutes abuse of power and a fraud on the Constitution, noting that a 1989 ordinance by which the State government took over 429 Sanskrit schools in Bihar was promulgated several times until 1992, but not once tabled in the State Assembly ORDINANCES IMPLICATIONS ➢The judgement widens the scope of judicial review of ordinances. ➢The court can go into whether the President or Governor had any material to arrive at the satisfaction that an ordinance was necessary and to examine whether there was any tilted motive. ➢Maintenance of constitutional decorum and legislative control over law making. ➢Use of an ordinance by the President/Union Cabinet need not always be a cynical move to privilege political expediency over parliamentary accountability. ➢The contention that ordinances are to be used only in times of exigent circumstances must also be balanced by the view that disruption of parliament as a political tactic plays a significant role in delaying urgent legislation. Moreover, a disruptive House may sometimes constitute a compelling circumstance in itself. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ORDINANCES What is a Tribunal? ➢ Tribunals are institutions established for discharging judicial or quasi-judicial duties. The objective may be to reduce case load of the judiciary or to bring in subject expertise for technical matters. ➢ The Supreme Court has ruled that tribunals, being quasi-judicial bodies, should have the same level of independence from the executive as the judiciary. Key factors include the mode of selection of members, the composition of tribunals, and the terms and tenure of service. ➢ In order to ensure that tribunals are independent from the executive, the Supreme Court had recommended that all administrative matters be managed by the law ministry rather than the ministry associated with the subject area. Later, the Court recommended creation of an independent National Tribunals Commission for the administration of tribunals. These recommendations have not been implemented. TRIBUNALS Tribunals Need of tribunals: ➢ To overcome the problem of pendency in Courts and reduce workload of courts. ➢ To expedite decisions and to provide a forum which would be manned by lawyers and experts in the areas falling under the jurisdiction of the tribunal. ➢ To perform specialised roles in various fields such as hearing disputes related to the environment, armed forces,tax and administrative issues. ➢ Tribunals were not part of the original Constitution;they were incorporated into the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. TribunalsTribunals Article 323A Article 323B Deals with Administrative tribunals Deals with tribunals for other matters- NGT, COMPAT, SAT Adjudication of disputes in following matters: • Taxation • Foreign Exchange, import-export • Industries and labor • Land reforms • Ceiling on urban property • Elections to Parliament and State Legislature • Rent and tenancy rights Can be established only by the Parliament Can be established by Parliament or State Legislature In 2010, the Supreme Court clarified that the subject matters under Article 323B are not exclusive, and legislatures are empowered to create tribunals on any subject matters under their purview as specified in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution Only one at Centre and one for each State (for two/more States) There can be hierarchy of tribunals CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS (42 CA, 1976) Tribunals ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TRIBUNALS Advantages Disadvantages Offers flexibility when compared to ordinary courts that have to adhere to strict procedures Goes against the spirit of Rule of Law Cheap and speedy justice Procedure followed is simple and easy to understand Uniform code of procedure for civil and criminal cases, however, administrative tribunals have no uniformity Offer relief to ordinary courts that are already overburdened Sometimes has led by subject matter experts, who have no experience of judicial proceedings Tribunals PRIMARY ISSUES WITH TRIBUNALS • Independence of tribunals • Any involvement of the central government in administrative activities of tribunals (such as sanctioning leave for members) would affect their independence • The Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice (2015) recommended creation of an independent body called the National Tribunals Commission (NTC) for administration of all tribunals in India • Pendency of cases • Even some tribunals face the issue of a large backlog of cases • As of March 15, 2021, the central government industrial tribunal cum-labour courts had 7,312 pending cases; as of February 28, 2021, the Armed Forces Tribunal had 18,829 pending cases; and as of January 1, 2018, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal had 91,643 pending cases • The lack of human resources (such as inadequate number judges) is observed to be one of the key reasons for accumulation of pending cases in courts. • The NCLT had only 30 members against a total strength of 63, These vacancies are concerning because as of May 31, 13,170 insolvency petitions were pending before benches of the NCLT. • The Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice (2015) had noted that several tribunals (such as Cyber Appellate Tribunal and Armed Forces Tribunal) have vacancies which makes them dysfunctional Tribunals KEY DEVLEOPMENTS OF TRIBUNALS Tribunals The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Act, 2021 • Outline : • Dissolves certain existing appellate bodies and transfers their functions to other existing judicial bodies. (Cinematograph, Trademarks, Copyright, Customs, Patents, Airports, Plant Varieties, GI) • 50 years as Minimum age to become a Chairperson • Term of Office : 4 years, Chairperson : 70 years, Other Members : 67 • Broad Issues : • Increases judicial burden • Contrary to SC • Term should be 5 years • Minimum age of 50 years discourages young talent, advocates with 10 years of experience should be eligible as judicial members Tribunals Key Developments : • 2017 – • Finance Act, 2017 merged 26 tribunals into 19. It delegated powers to the central government to make Rules • Ministry of Finance notified Rules • 2019 – Rojer Mathew versus South Indian Bank Ltd & Ors • Supreme Court struck down the 2017 Rules The Court stated that the Rules did not meet the requirements laid down in earlier judgements mandating judicial independence • The Court directed the central government to reformulate the Rules. Key concerns that the Court wanted addressed include: • (i) short tenures which prevent enhancement of adjudicatory experience, and thus impact the efficacy of Tribunals, and • (ii) lack of judicial dominance in selection committees which is in direct contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers. • 2020 – Madras Bar Association vs Union of India • New Rules were notified, which were again challenged in the Supreme Court mainly over the lack of conformity with the principles laid out earlier by the Court. For example: the 2020 Rules specified four-year term of office against five years as specified by the Supreme Court in 2019. • The Court suggested certain amendments to the 2020 Rules such as increasing the term of office to five-year along with eligibility for re-appointment (subjected to upper age limits), and allowing advocates with 10 years’ experience to be appointed as judicial members. • 2021 - Madras Bar Association vs Union of India • Under the Finance Act, 2017, new Rules were notified on June 30, 2021. The Rules allow advocates with 10 years’ relevant experience eligible for appointment as judicial members and provide details on house rent allowance for members • The Ordinance and the Rules were challenged in the Supreme Court. The Court struck down provisions related to the four-year tenure and the minimum age requirement of 50 years for members of tribunals. TribunalsTribunals Some Suggestions Tribunals National Tribunals Commission • first mooted in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) • NTC must be established vide a constitutional amendment or be backed by a statute that guarantees it functional, operational and financial independence. • Need for an authority to support uniform administration across all tribunals • The NTC could therefore pave the way for the separation of the administrative and judicial functions carried out by various tribunals • A ‘corporatised’ structure of NTC with a Board, a CEO and a Secretariat will allow it to scale up its services and provide requisite administrative support to all tribunals across the country • It could set performance standards for the efficiency of tribunals and their own administrative processes. • It could function as an independent recruitment body to develop and operationalise the procedure for disciplinary proceedings and appointment of tribunal members. • Administrative roles of the NTC include providing support services to tribunal members, litigants, and their lawyers. For this purpose, it would need to be able to hire and supervise administrative staff, and to consolidate, improve, and modernise tribunals’ infrastructure. Tribunals Should Statutory Tribunals Have Suo Moto Powers? • Context : • On May 7th 2020, a gas leak in Visakhapatnam killed 11 and hospitalised hundreds of people. The very next day, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) initiated proceedings against LG Polymers, the owners of the chemical plant. Although no one had filed a petition, the NGT took up the case based on media reports about the leak. They passed an Order imposing a fine of Rs. 50 Crores on LG Polymers, even before a notice was sent to them. The fine was decided based on the value of the company and the Tribunal’s estimates of likely damages. • In October 2018, the NGT passed an order based on a news report, imposing a five crore fine on the Mumbai Municipal Corporation for improper waste management • Similarly, in March 2021, the NGT passed an order based on a letter written to the Chairman. The order increased the minimum distance of quarries from residential areas from 50 to 200 metres • This Order was passed by a statutory tribunal exercising suo moto powers. • A statutory tribunal is a quasi-judicial body, which unlike a court of law, is an administrative institution with the power to decide cases on defined subject matter. • Statutory Tribunals’ powers are limited to their statutory jurisdiction and are not a constitutional court of general jurisdiction Tribunals Rationale : • The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (NGT Act), which establishes the NGT, does not expressly provide the tribunal with suo moto powers. • In The Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 the limited suo moto powers of the Land Tribunal is clearly mentioned in s 122A. • The Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal held that the Debt Recovery Tribunal does not enjoy suo moto powers. It noted that suo moto powers were not expressly mentioned in the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and could not be inferred from the general power to regulate its own procedures. Tribunals ➢ Established in 2010 for effective and expeditious disposal of cases that are related to protection and conservation of the environment,forests and other natural resources. ➢ Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial question relating to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment). ➢ ‘Special’because India is the third country following Australia and New Zealand to have such a system. ➢ Principal Bench in New Delhi and regional benches in Pune (West),Bhopal (Central),Chennai (South) and Kolkata(East). Landmark cases: ➢ Betty C. Alvares vs.The State of Goa and Ors.- Even a Foreign National Can Approach the NGT ➢ Almitra H.Patel & Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors.- Complete prohibition on open burning of waste on lands ➢ Manoj MisraVs. Delhi Development Authority & Ors.– The Art of Living Foundation was penalized INR 5 Crores for damaging theYamuna plains during its conduct of theWorld Culture Festival. Challenges: ➢ Two important acts -Wildlife (Protection) Act,1972 and Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 have been left out of NGT’s purview,which restricts the jurisdiction of NGT and hampers functioning. ➢ Lack of clarity on the position of the NGT in relation to High Courts results in NGT decisions being challenged in various High Courts under Article 226 under the argument that High Courts are superior to the NGT, despite the NGT Act providing for appeals directly to the Supreme Court. ➢ The decisions of the NGT are not fully complied with by stakeholders or the government,under the pretext of an unfeasible timeframe. ➢ The lack of human and financial resources has led to high pendency of cases - which undermines NGT’s very objective of disposal of appeals within 6 months. NATIONAL GREEN TRIBUNAL Tribunals NGT & Suo-Moto Powers • On October 7th 2021, in Municipal Corporation of Bombay v Ankita Sinha. The Court decided that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has suo moto powers. • The NGT was Formed to Protect a Key Aspect of the Right to Life • Section 14 states that for the NGT to be able to hear a matter: there must be a civil case; which substantially concerns the environment; and involves the implementation of environmental legislations. If these three prerequisites are satisfied, the NGT may exercise jurisdiction • NGT’s Role Goes Beyond Dispute Resolution • The Court held that as long as the ‘sphere of action’ is not breached, the NGT’s powers must be read widely. • The NGT Should be Guided by the Principles of Environmental Justice and Equity Tribunals ➢ The ultimate power of Judiciary to review and determine validity of a law or an order. ➢ The power of a court to inquire whether a law, executive order or other official action conflicts with the Constitution and if the court concludes that it does, to declare it unconstitutional and void. ➢ Judicial Review is one of the checks and balances to the doctrine of separation of powers. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM Judicial Review & Activism NEED/JUSTIFICATION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ➢ Supremacy of the Constitution : The judiciary is considered as the guardian of the Constitution upholding the rule of law by declaring any action void, if it is in violation of constitution and also to limit the arbitrary powers of the government in order to upholding constitutionalism. ➢ Ensuring separation of power by acting as a check and balance and putting the powers of the legislatures and the executives under some restraints and not making them uncontrolled and arbitrary ➢ Maintaining federal equilibrium : The justification of judicial review function can also be attributed to federal set up, as we have one Government at the Centre and one at the State level and both of them make law in their respective sphere. In case of inconsistency among these laws or the question of competency of law making, there should be an impartial body to adjudicate upon these issues, independent of any pressures. Hence in a federal State, judicial arbitration is inevitable in order to maintain balance between the Centre and the State. ➢ Where the Constitution guarantees the fundamental rights, legislative violation of the these rights can be scrutinized by the court alone. Judicial Review & Activism ➢ Failure of other organs in discharging their duties – Many times, several laws and schemes in the social and economic sectors have remained mere declaration of good intentions and when this happens it leads to an erosion of the confidence of the citizens in the constitutional values and democracy. In such a scenario, the judiciary steps into the areas usually earmarked for the legislature and executive. ➢ To fill legislative vacuum and meet societal needs the courts often indulge in judicial legislation thereby encroaching in the domain of legislature. NEED FOR JUDICIAL ACTIVISM Judicial Review & Activism SUBJECTS OF JR- INDIA FEATURES OF JR- INDIA ➢ Violation of fundamental rights. ➢ Violation of various legal rights/constitutional restrictions. ➢ Enactment of statutes and other legislative/executive actions in violation of Constitutional mandate regarding distribution/separation of powers. ➢ Delegation of essential legislative power by the legislature to the executive or any other body. ➢ Violation of implied limitations and restrictions. ➢ Both Supreme Court and High courts exercise the power of judicial review but ultimate and final power to determine the constitutional validity lies with the Supreme Court. ➢ Judicial Review can be conducted in respect of all central and state laws. ➢ Judicial Review applies only to the questions of law, not questions of fact. ➢ Limitations - Judicial Review cannot be conducted on laws dealing with subjects in the ninth schedule of Constitution of India. ➢ Judicial Review cannot be undertaken suo moto by the courts. Judicial Review & Activism ➢Advantages ➢Disadvantages ➢ Keeps misuse of power in check, maintains federal balance ➢ Device for protection of people’s rights ➢ Undemocratic- interferes with separation of powers doctrine ➢ Lack of clearly defined system ➢ Secures independence of judiciary ➢ Helps Courts exercise their Constitutional duties ➢ Fear of judicial tyranny and irresponsible Parliament ➢ Reversal of previous decisions- subjectivity in judgement. Eg- Golaknath case judgement reversed the earlier judgements, and Kesavananda Bharati judgement reversed the Golaknath judgement Judicial Review & Activism DIFFERENCES & DISTINCTIONS Judicial review Judicial activism Judicial overreach Definition Process by which judiciary reviews the validity of laws More active role taken by judiciary to dispense social justice; connected with enforceability When courts step into the shoes of the legislature and executive, in violation of SOP Origin Article 13 of the Constitution No constitutional backing No origin; undesirable in any democracy Examples Sec 66A of the IT Act was struck down for being in violation with FRs Introduction of Basic Structure, institutionalization of PIL, banning smoking in public places Allahabad HC, 2015- compulsory for bureaucrats to send their children to govt schools; All cinema halls to play national anthem before featuring film Judicial Review & Activism JUDGEMENTS JUDICIAL REVIEW JUDICIAL ACTIVISM ➢ S. P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India - Justice P.N. Bhagwati, C.J. established that judicial review was a basic feature of Constitution. ➢ L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India - Bench stated: “that the power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Article 226 and in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure”. ➢ Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India – The Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. ➢ Indian Young Lawyers’ Association v. State of Kerala – Allowed entry of women into the Sabarimala Temple. ➢ K.S. Puttaswami vs. Union of India – Right to Privacy declared a fundamental right under Article 21 and is enforceable against the State. ➢ Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan – The Supreme Court laid down guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment of women at the workplace, which was followed for nearly 16 years before the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013). Judicial Review & Activism PROVISION GIST ARTICLE 13 Any law which contravenes any provision of the part of FRs shall be void ARTICLES 32 AND 226 Entrusts the roles of protector and guarantor of FRs to the SC and HCs ARTICLES 131-136 • Entrusts the SC with the power to adjudicate disputes between individuals, between individuals and the State, between States and the Union • The court may be required to interpret the provisions of the Constitution and the interpretation given by the SC becomes honored by all courts of the land ARTICLE 143 The Constitution u/A. 143 authorises the President to seek the opinion of the SC in two categories of matters: • On any quest of law or fact of public importance which has arisen or which is likely to arise • On any dispute arising out of pre-Constitution Treaty, agreement, Covenant, engagement or other similar instruments ARTICLE 145 Gives SC power to frame rules including rules regarding condition on which a person can practice before the Court ARTICLE 227 States that every HC shall have suprintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction (except a court formed under a law related to armed forces) ARTICLE 246(3) Ensures the State Legislature’s exclusive powers on matters pertaining to the State List ARTICLES 251 AND 254 States that in case of inconsistency between Union and State laws, the State law shall be void ARTICLE 372 (1) Establishes the Judicial Review of the pre-Constitution legislation CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS Judicial Review & Activism ➢ Judicial Activism is criticized primarily on two grounds – ➢ firstly, law making is the responsibility of the legislature only and ➢ secondly, judges are neither elected by the people nor are answerable to the. ➢ Therefore, since courts are not representative bodies reflecting the will of people , they aren’t competent enough to know what the people want. ➢ However , many scholars feel that judicial activism is democratic because there is accountability of the judges through their reasoning in their decisions. If the reasons are wrong the decisions are criticized, are set aside and reconsidered and this fosters accountability in them. ➢ Hence ,when executive and legislature are apathetic and fail to discharge their duties, bureaucracy is indifferent towards its duties, all this affects the basic rights of the people. Therefore, judiciary cannot turn a blind eye towards the laxity/ incompetency of the other two organs and has to step in to fill the gap. Does judicial activism undermine parliamentary democracy/ Has it taken over the role of executive and legislature? Judicial Review & Activism ➢ Golakhnath case, Kesavananda Bharati case, Vishaka Guidelines, Abolition of adultery, decriminalisation of sec 377 IPC, abolition of Triple Talaq, protection of environment and ecology, abolition of bonded labour, ban on smoking in public places , in Olga Telis v/s Union of India, the court said that the outlines of Article 21 which provides right to life also include itself the Right to livelihood as well as shelter, creation of collegium system in Judges transfer case, institutionalization of PIL, provide mid-day meals to schoolchildren, witness protection scheme etc. ➢ Courts have also entered into the fields traditionally reserved for executive in order to improve the implementation of the law by using interim directions – in Shriram Fertilizer Gas Leak case it ordered the plant to be closed and setting up of victim compensation fund. In Dehradun Quarrying case, it closed limestone quarries in Mussoorie, SC ordered the government to appoint a committee to look into the issues pertaining to bad loans, ordering the UPA government to set up SIT to investigate black money, asking to create a new policy to handle drought etc. ➢ But at times, it has been observed that the judges become too adventurous and indulge in Judicial overreach. E.g.- liquor ban, imposition of Patriotism in National Anthem Case, setting up of Lodha Committee to reform the Board of Control for Cricket in India which is a private body etc. JA: DETAILED EXAMPLES Judicial Review & Activism Examples : • The concept of judicial review was first used and developed by the American Supreme Court in the case of Marbury v. Madison • JR : Shankari Prasad, Indira Gandhi, Kesavananda Bharati, Sajjan Singh, Minerva Mill • L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (3 dimensions) • To ensure justice in executive action, • To safeguard the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, and • To decide on issues of legislative competence among the union and the states. • JA : • Bandhua Mukti Morcha, Neeraja Chaudhary, and People’s Union for Democratic Rights, • Murli S. Deora v. Union of India (banning of smoking in public places) • JO : • Proactive censorship in the case of Jolly LLB 2, • NJAC Bill, • Shyam Narayan Chouksey v. Union of India, the hon’ble court delivered a judgment imposing the patriotism of National Anthem making it mandatory to be played in the cinema halls/theatres before starting the film, • In the case of State of Tamil Nadu v. K. Balu, the Supreme Court while dealing with a petition for road safety, banned the sale of liquor within the 500 metres of any national or state highway with the aim to ensure the safety of the highway users ➢ Judicial Review is the inevitable response of the judiciary to ensure proper check on the exercise of public power. ➢ There is a thin line between Judicial activism and judicial overarch, just as independence of the judiciary is part of basic structure, the primacy of the legislature in policy making is also part of basic structure and interference by the courts into their domain is not always justified. Additionally, even the society at large should not indulge in Judicial romanticism by abusing the PIL ➢ It is not that a judge should never be an activist , but such activism should be done only in exceptional cases and ordinarily judges should exercise self-restraint and should limit their activism only in the cases where - such judicial legislation is for furthering the mandates of the constitution, or a legal norm is required by society for its smooth running and for some reason the legislature is unwilling or unable to create it, and when there is a gap in the statutory law. ➢ Given the crucial role of the judiciary in protection and even evolution of the law of the land, it is vital that the judiciary desist from passing ad hoc decisions without the backing of sound principles, particularly, when the decision appears to break new grounds. CONCLUSION Judicial Review & Activism ➢ Any citizen can file a public case by filing a petition: ➢ Under Art.32 of the Indian Constitution,in the Supreme Court. ➢ Under Art.226 of the Indian Constitution,in the High Court ➢ Under S.133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in the Court of Magistrate. ➢ The Court must be satisfied that the writ petition fulfills some basic needs for PIL. ➢ Further,the Court can treat even a letter as a writ petition and take action upon it so long as: ➢ the letter is addressed by an aggrieved person; or ➢ a public spirited individual;or ➢ a social action group for enforcement of the constitutional or the legal rights of a person in custody or of a class or group of persons who by reason of poverty, disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position find it difficult to approach the court for redress. ➢ A PIL can be filed against public bodies and authorities, but not against private parties. HOW CAN A PIL BE INITIATED? PIL PIL Context : • On an Average, the Supreme Court Receives over 25,000 PILs a Year • 2019 : Highest PILs Filed in SC : 70,836 • The first PIL was admitted in 1979 in the case of Hussainara Khatoon v State of Bihar. This PIL sought justice for undertrial prisoners in Bihar who had remained in jail awaiting trial for a longer period of time than they would have been sentenced to if found guilty. • More recently, it has been used to bring to the Court matters pertaining to the plight of migrant children during the pandemic, the constitutionality of Muslim marriage practices, and the need to update abortion laws. • Letter petitions and writ petitions are entertained as PILs. Letter petitions are filed more frequently than writ petitions. Letter petitions allow the general public to approach the court easily, in comparison to writ petitions which are affected by social and political conditions. PIL SUBJECT MATTERS ENTERTAINED IN PILS INCLUDE: ➢ Bonded Labour matters; ➢ Neglected Children; ➢ Exploitation of casualworkers; ➢ Non-payment of minimum wages; ➢ Atrocities towards women; ➢ Environmental pollution and disturbance of ecological balance; ➢ Food adulteration; ➢ Maintenance of heritage andculture. ➢ Hussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar (Considered first PIL case in India - focused on the inhuman conditions of prisons and under trial prisoners). ➢ M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (Several cases for environment preservation were initiated byway of PILs). ➢ Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (The Supreme Court laid down guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment of women at the workplace, which was followed for nearly 16 years before the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act,2013). ➢ Parmanand Katara v. Union of India (The Supreme Court held in this case that it is a paramount obligation of every member of medical profession to give medical aid to every injured citizen as soon as possible without waiting for any procedural formalities). LANDMARK PIL CASES PIL ➢ Accessible legal redressal for all, especially poor and marginalised, balance of law and justice. ➢ Allows access to justice for economically challenged sections, and provides a platform for them to advocate for their rights. ➢ Implements judicial reviewconcept. ➢ Ensures judicial monitoring of state institutions (transparency, inter se checks and balances between wings of the government). ➢ Democratizes justice;protects human rights. ➢ Raises awareness on important issues. ➢ Allows judicial monitoring of state institutions ADVANTAGES OF PIL ➢ Problem of competing rights, wherein the recognition or grant of rights to one section of the society leads to disadvantage to another section of marginalized population (E.g. shutting down of polluting industries leads to loss of employment for daily wagers dependent on that industry). ➢ Frivolous cases can be filed by parties with vested interest without heavy court fees, leading to the time and attention of the Court being diverted from genuine and crucial matters. ➢ Potential for judicial overreach, which violates the doctrine of separation of powers. ➢ Inordinate delays in the disposal of PIL cases. DISADVANTAGES OF PIL PIL WHAT IS ADR? ➢Conflict management via a mechanism of dispute resolution that is alternative to traditional adversarial litigation. ➢Dispute resolution in cost-effective manner and with increased efficacy (promotes working together co-operatively, reducing hostility and reaching solution optimum for both parties.) ➢Generally, neutral third party helps parties to communicate, discuss differences and resolve dispute. ➢The Legal Services Authorities Act was passed in 1987 to encourage out-of-court settlements, The Arbitration and Conciliation Act was enacted in 1996 and was significantly amended in2019. “It is the spirit and not the form of law that keeps the justice alive.” ~ LJ Earl Warren ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION WHY ADR? ➢ Not just an alternative means, but an additional method that is utilized by courts to ease the burden of pending cases.(The Court also orders mediation between parties in some cases so that the burden of the courts may be relieved and the parties may come to a compromise amongst themselves under Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code) ➢ Provides scientifically developed techniques – reduces burden on the judiciary. ➢ Urgent need to clear mounting backlog of cases.(speedier process as formal court proceedings are avoided.) ➢ Make litigation affordable to the ordinary people. (less expensive than going to court; saves stress of court appearances for common man.) ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTIONALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION LOK ADALAT ➢ A non-adversarial system based on Gandhian principles – known as People’s Courts; ➢ Assumed statutory recognition under Legal Services Authority Act, 1987. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ISSUES ➢ Though it is true that “Justice delayed is justice denied”, it is also true that “justice hurried is justice buried.” ➢ System of Lok Adalats is based on compromise and settlement – if parties do not arrive at consensus: ➢ Case is returned to the court of law; ➢ Unnecessary delays in the dispensation of justice. ➢ Members other than Chairman are persons without a legal background, even in Permanent Lok Adalat. ➢ Judges are pressured to quickly dispose of the cases for political gains: ➢ Limited consideration to the parties 'rights and needs. ➢ Provisions of Code of Civil Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act not strictly applicable: ➢ Decisions made only if element of settlement exists. ➢ Decisions will be in a summary manner. ➢ If parties do not settle, Permanent Lok Adalat shall decide the dispute. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SOLUTIONS ➢ Legal Awareness ➢ Accessible legal literacy/ legal aid programs for the marginalized. ➢ Awareness camp sat grassroot level. ➢ Mass media coverage to encourage public approach to Lok Adalats. ➢ Expanded Jurisdiction ➢ Inclusion of business disputes or conflicts where the public at large are involved. ➢ More Lawyers ➢ Improved quality of legal aid. ➢ Incentivizing lawyers to provide effective legal assistance to the needy, e.g. Increasing renumerations. ➢ Cultural & Structural Reforms ➢ Balance between formal and informal forum to encourage public. ➢ Mobilization of resources - staff, funding and facilities – enhance structural soundness of Lok Adalats. ➢ Including specialists of concerned disputes. ➢ Free legal training to social workers to prevent exploitation of poor by lawyers. ➢ Encouraging referral to Lok Adalats to increase awareness and reduce prejudice against it. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION LEGISLATIONS OF ADR IN INDIA ➢Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 - if it appears to court there exist elements of settlement outside the court then court formulate the terms of the possible settlement and refer the same for: ➢Arbitration, ➢Conciliation, ➢Mediation or Lok Adalat. ➢Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - modernization of The Arbitration Act, 1940, which dealt with only domestic arbitration. ➢The Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 - passed in 1987 to encourage out-of-court settlements; ➢To provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ADVANTAGES ➢ Less time consuming: people resolve their dispute in shorter periods as compared to traditional litigation in courts, which may take years ➢ Cost effective: ➢ It saves lot of money if one undergoes in litigation process. ➢ Informal: ➢ It is free from technicalities of courts resulting in fewer procedural delays; people are free to express themselves without any fear or intimidation. ➢ Efficient: ➢ There are always chances of restoring relationship back as parties discuss their issues together on the same platform. ➢ Preserves the best interests of parties and prevents further conflict and souring of relationships. ➢ Specialized expertise can be made available on the tribunal in order to facilitate the most appropriate outcome. ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION DISADVANTAGES ➢ Several issues like admitted liability, divorce, granting of probates etc. cannot be referred to arbitration. ➢ Can only be adopted when there is no statutory bar and further if parties mutually agree. ➢ Quality of ADR depends on the arbitrator/mediator it; ➢ Depending on arbitrator, it sometimes proves to be more costly than court litigation (Arbitration and Conciliation Act in this regard provides for the Court's intervention at the appropriate situation so that ADR is not misused resulting in miscarriage of justice. ➢ Further, due to parties often appealing Arbitral Awards before Courts, Commercial entities are beginning to view Arbitration as a wasted exercise that is costly and time consuming) ➢ Hurdles in the effective implementation of ADR are many which include the following: ➢ Lack of appropriate arbitrators (very often, retired judges are appointed as arbitrators, which results in arbitrators assuming the adversarial form of dispute resolution which they are comfortable with. This is viewed unfavorably, especially since the arbitrators often lack the expertise to resolve complex factual disputes in international commercial arbitration). ➢ Lack of infrastructural facilities. ➢ Lack of awareness and legal literacy ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION WAY FORWARD ➢ There is a lack of awareness about the availability of ADR mechanisms. ➢ The National and State Legal Services Authorities should disseminate more information regarding these, so they become the first option explored by potential litigants. ➢ Requisite infrastructure should be provided, and institutional framework put to place to achieve goals of adoption of ADR mechanisms. ➢ ADR centers should be created for settling disputes out-of-court. ➢ The award should be made binding on the parties and no appeal to the court should be allowed unless itis arrived at fraudulently or if it against public policy (will make sure that ADR is binding and prevent delay of implementation of the award.) ➢ Several online ADR platforms have been launched such as SAMA and ADR-ODR International which facilitate dispute resolution online. These platforms must be encouraged and given official recognition, so that Courts may take their assistance in referring cases to ADR.
