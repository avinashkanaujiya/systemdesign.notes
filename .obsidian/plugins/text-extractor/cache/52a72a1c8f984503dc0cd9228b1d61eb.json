ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS India’ s Foreign Secretary asserted that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit held virtually “in no way signifies, hints, insinuates the dilution in the objectives that India is trying to seek of the SCO Summit”. INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO): 2 /3 SCO is a permanent intergovernmental international organization. It’s a Eurasian political, economic and military organization aiming to maintain peace, security and stability in the region. It was created in 2001 . The SCO Charter was signed in 2002, and entered into force in 2003. India and Pakistan became members in 2017. On 17th September , 2021, it was announced that Iran would become a full member of the SCO. Objectives : India’ s stand in SCO: India’ s combative assertiveness on issues of concern to India (terrorism and connectivity) which has fundamental dif ferences with China and Pakistan. On terrorism: India’ s PM said : “Some countries use cross border terrorism as an instrument of their policies, to provide shelter to terrorists. On connectivity: It is a core issue for the SCO India’ s isolation in the organization is apparent. India’ s position: connectivity projects should respect national sovereignty . China’ s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) violates Indian sovereignty . The BRI and challenges for India: BRI’ s negative consequences have not inhibited the enthusiasm of SCO members for it. India has to find ways to maintain close ties with Eurasia. The promotion of Buddhist heritage w ill not help in drawing SCO members towards India and prevent their growing links with China. The Chabahar project (Iran) has not moved ahead as it needs to. SCO on Ukraine war: 3 /3 The SCO Declaration was silent on the Ukraine war . India, Pakistan or China did not refer to it in their summit statements. The Russian President mentioned Ukraine and castigated the W est. W ay Forward India needs to be alive to the danger of China integrating Eurasia and shutting it out of the region with Pakistan’ s active support. India has to devote far greater resources and energy to develop connectivity through Iran. Active air corridors with the Central Asian Republics a nd a pragmatic policy towards Afghanistan (that does not mean the diplomatic recognition of the T aliban) are essential.
