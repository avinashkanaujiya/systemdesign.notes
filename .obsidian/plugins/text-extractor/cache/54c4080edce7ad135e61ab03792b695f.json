WHAT IS ARTICLE 368? (Introduction) Structure followed ARTICLE 368 ▪ Evolution of Art 368 is correlated to the evolution of amenability of Fundamental Rights and the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles ▪ Evolved through a series of Constitutional Amendments and landmark SC judgements ultimately giving birth to the doctrine of Basic Structure which set the course for expansive Judicial Review and Activism as they were a part of the doctrine of Basic Structure Art 368 Relationship b/w FR and DPSP FR Amenability [13(2)] HOW HAS IT EVOLVED OVER TIME? ARTICLE 368 ▪ Art 13(2) invalidates any law that attempts to violate any Fundamental Right while Art 368 empowers the Parliament to amend the Constitution ▪ To address the inequalities of land ownership, nation wide land reform acts were enacted in different states (land is a State Subject) to enforce upper limits of land holding in excess of which would be compulsorily purchased by the State. ▪ This was construed an attack on an erstwhile fundamental right to Property and other rights such as Equality and Expression by the landowners. This led to multiple petition filed across the country challenging respective state land reform laws. ▪ The Parliament enacted the 1st Constitution Amendment Act, 1951 within one year of the new constitution in force adding Schedule 11 which prohibited Judicial Review of any law placed under it. Several state laws were also added to Schedule 11. ▪ Most of the landmark judgements arose out of landowners seeking their land rights which were restricted by laws placed under constitutional protection from Judicial review. ▪ Land reforms can be said to be starting point of it all as most of the amenability of fundamental rights originated from there which in turn impacted Art. 368. INSIGHTS ARTICLE 368 ▪ Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (1951) & Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan : SC held that the Parliament enjoys absolute constituent power to amend the any part of the Constitution including fundamental rights as constitutional amendments were not considered ‘law’ as the restrictions under Art. 13(2) ▪ Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967) : In a complete reversal, the SC held that the Parliament does not have absolute power and no fundamental right can be amended. It also categorically said that constitutional amendments were to be considered ‘law’ as the restrictions under Art. 13(2) ▪ Kesavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala (1973) : The government passed a series of constitutional amendments (24, 25, and 26th) trying to reverse Golak Nath’s judgement. The largest ever bench of the SC in India history delivered a balancing act judgment by – ▪ Declaring that the Parliament can amend anything in the Constitution as long as it does not violate the Doctrine of Basic Structure ▪ Doctrine of Basic Structure would be a series of principles that would be identified by the SC from time to time ▪ Additions made to the IXth schedule post the judgment would also be subject to judicial review ▪ IR Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu (2007) : SC held that anything ever placed in the IXth Schedule would be subject to Judicial Review it if attempts to violate Basic Structure. KEY MILESTONES ARTICLE 368 Art 368’s current status: Parliament can amend anything in the Constitution if it does not violate Basic Structure. Implications of Art 368’s current status: ▪ 104 Constitutional Amendments in less than 75 years of becoming a nation and 70 years of enforcing the Constitution ▪ Expansive Judicial Review as it is a part of Basic Structure ▪ Striking down of 99 CA (NJAC) which would have fundamental altered Judicial Appointments in the country ▪ 103 CA (2019) on EWS reservation currently challenged (Youth For Equality v. Union of India) ▪ Art 370 Abrogation Challenged (Manohar Lal Sharma v. Union of India) ▪ Constitutionality of Art 35 A (We the Citizens v. Union of India) ARTICLE 368 ▪ The foundation of Constitutionalism is the creation of State limited by the Constitution. ▪ It the Parliament is bestowed with unlimited powers to amend the Constitution; it would defeat the purpose of having a Constitution in the first place. ▪ Governments have been known to enact questionable constitutional amendments to suit ulterior motives especially during the Emergency Era (42 CA, 1976). ▪ Absolute power corrupts absolutely. ▪ However, the SC must also respect the democratic mandate duly attained by the Government and collective morality in the interest of the people must always prevail. IS THE EVOLUTION OF ART 368 JUSTIFIED? (Conclusion) ARTICLE 368 ▪ “Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic set up. If democracy means government of the people by the people, it is obvious that every citizen must be entitled to participate in the democratic process and in order to enable him to intelligently exercise his rights of making a choice, free & general discussion of public matters is absolutely essential.” – Justice Bhagwati in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978 ▪ Under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution, all citizens shall have the Fundamental Right: ▪ to freedom of speech and expression ▪ to assemble peaceably and without arms ▪ to form associations or unions ▪ to move freely throughout the territory of India ▪ to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India ▪ to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business ▪ This was expanded to include the right to receive and disseminate information in. ▪ International conventions including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, European convention on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also guarantee freedom of speech and expression and its protection. Introduction🡪 Significance🡪 Judgements🡪 Reasonable Restrictions on freedom of speech & expression (in light of current affairs) INTRODUCTION ARTICLE 19 Structure followed ▪ It is considered first condition of liberty. ▪ It is essential for all democratic functions and processes, and for active participation in democracy. ▪ It plays a crucial role information of public opinion on social, economic & political matters. ▪ Free speech is an inviolable aspect of fulfilment. SIGNIFICANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION ARTICLE 19 ▪ In Romesh Thappar v State of Madras, 1950 the Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes freedom to propagate ideas which is ensured by freedom of circulation of a publication. Moreover, freedom of speech and of Press was declared to be the foundation of all democratic organisations. ▪ The cases of Bennet and Coleman & Co. v. Union of India, 1973 and Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) P. Ltd v. Union of India, 1986 extended freedom of expression to corporations and the SC declared that limitations on the right outside the purview of Article 19(2) are not valid. ▪ In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978 the SC ruled that freedom of speech and expression was not limited by geographical limitations or boundaries and claimed that Article 19(1)(a) encompasses both the right to speak and the freedom to express in India and also abroad. ▪ In Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, 1986, where three school students in Kerala were dismissed for not singing the national anthem even though they stood respectfully the SC held that they had not committed any offence under Prevention of Insults to the National Honor Act of 1971. Moreover, the right to silence was declared part of right to freedom of speech. ▪ In Odyssey Communications (P) Ltd. v. Lokvidayan Sanghatana, 1988 the SC acknowledged the right to broadcast and advertise as modern aspects of freedom of speech and expression. ▪ In People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of India, 1997 the SC declared that telephone tapping, violates Article 19(1)(a) unless it comes within the grounds of reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). ▪ In Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India and Ors, 2020 the SC ruled that freedom to access the Internet is a fundamental right and is protected under Article 19(1)(a) IMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS ARTICLE 19 ▪ The Right to Protest is enshrined in the constitution – Article 19(1)(b) assures citizens the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. ▪ Public order as a reasonable restriction under Article 19(2) was added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. Public order implies absence of violence and an orderly state of affairs in which citizens can peacefully pursue their normal avocation of life. It also includes public safety. However, criticism of the government does not necessarily disturb public order. ▪ A broader interpretation of Article 19 includes the right to freely express opinion on the conduct of the government. The right to association becomes the right to associate for political purposes. The right to peaceably assemble also allows political parties and citizenship bodies such as university-based student groups to question and object to acts of the government by demonstrations, agitations and public meetings, to launch sustained protest movements. ▪ Important Judgment: In Ramlila Maidan Incident v. Home Secretary, Union of India & Ors., 2012, the SC stated, “Citizens have a fundamental right to assembly and peaceful protest which cannot be taken away by an arbitrary executive or legislative action.” RIGHT TO PROTEST ARTICLE 19 ▪ Reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(2) include sedition – all those activities, whether through words or writing, determined to disrupt the State’s tranquility and drive misguided individuals to subvert the government. ▪ For an act to constitute sedition, it must be done an intention to cause disorder/disturbance of the public peace or law by resort to violence, and must incite violence. ▪ The 1962 SC judgment in Kedar Nath Singh versus State of Bihar upheld the restrictions imposed on Article 19 by Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code. But, comments, however strongly worded, critical of actions of the government and which shun violence are not sedition. SEDITION LAW ARTICLE 19 ▪ Restriction on the freedom of speech and expression can be imposed if it exceeds the reasonable and fair limit and amounts to contempt of court. ▪ The first Indian statute on the law of contempt, i.e., the Contempt of Courts Act was passed in 1926. It was later replaced by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. The 1952 Act was subsequently replaced by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. ▪ According to the 1971 Act, Contempt of court may be either ‘civil or ‘criminal.’ Civil contempt is 'wilful disobedience to any judgment/ decree/ direction/ order/ writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.’ Criminal contempt includes the publication (in any form) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which scandalises the court or lowers its authority, or prejudices or interferes with courts proceedings or administration of justice in any manner. ▪ Indian contempt law was amended in 2006 to make “truth” a defence. The qualification however is that such defence should not cover-up to escape from the consequences of a deliberate effort to scandalise the court. ▪ However, even after such amendment, a person can be punished for the statement unless they were made in public interest. ▪ In Het Ram Beniwal v. Raghuveer Singh, 2017 judgment the SC held that the power of contempt has to be exercised sparingly and in cases when there is a calculated effort to undermine the judiciary, and not in a routine manner. CONTEMPT OF COURT ARTICLE 19 ▪ Unfeasibility of content verification has led to growing vulnerability of the unfettered flow of speech to the peddling of unverified (and false/fake) information. ▪ Fake news or disinformation in India usually takes three forms: ▪ Targeting a minority and spreading false news implicating them in violent activities. ▪ Targeting particular individuals and spreading false news to tarnish their credibility and reputation. ▪ Spreading fake news about public personalities and their supposed heroics that increases their standing and influences political outcomes. ▪ Another form of fake news is malicious fake news designed to spread paranoia and mistrust among people. ▪ Reasons for prevalence: ▪ It is increasingly used as a political tool by parties to influence and polarise opinion. ▪ Proliferation of technology, cheaper devices and affordable access to internet has reduced the cost of spreading fake news. ▪ Increased use of private encrypted messaging apps and social media platforms whose business models thrive on “viral content” and number of views. ▪ Judgment: In Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India, 2020 the SC recognized the problem of infodemics in India and passed an order asking the state governments to comply with the directions issued by the Centre to curb the menace of fake news. FAKE NEWS/DISINFORMATION ARTICLE 19 ▪ Conflation of Free Speech and Curbing Fake News in Legislation: ▪ Information Technology Act, 2008 (IT Act) – Contrary to 2011 rules under the Act which provided immunity to social media platforms as ‘intermediaries’ for inception, transmission and reception of fake content through their networks, they are now directed to proactively censor content by the government. This is detrimental to free speech. ▪ Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) – Section 54 of the DMA purports to deal with ‘false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic’. The offence is punishable with imprisonment up to 1 year and the imposition of a fine. The provision is limited to the period of the disaster. ▪ Indian Penal Code (IPC) – Section 505(1)(b) deals with the spreading of false and mischievous content that results in fear or alarm to public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or public tranquility. Its application to fake news is however dubious as the latter is disguised as real news and more importantly, its source is often difficult to trace. ▪ Recommendation: the government must consistently invest in increasing voter awareness, voter literacy, a robust fact-checking environment and critical thinking among the masses. Social media platforms — through which fake news spreads so rapidly — on their part, should take up efforts to identify and combat such news. ARTICLE 19 Introduction🡪 Significance🡪 Recent developments that have thrown light on Article 21 Article 21 read as : “ No person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law.” The right has been held to be the heart of the Constitution, the most organize & progressive provision of our constitution, the foundation of our laws. INTRODUCTION ARTICLE 21 Structure followed ▪ Sexuality refers to choice and preference of sexual partners and personal sexual expression. It is not limited to one specific action, and can be expressed in outward non- sexual forms, for example, through clothing and Style. ▪ Gender on the other hand, is a social construction and refers to the conditioned understanding of how different genders (gendered roles are mostly restricted to masculinity and femininity) play specific normative roles. LGBTQIA+ ARTICLE 21 ▪ Gay and Lesbian – most basic classification on the basis of same sex-attraction; gay for men, lesbian for women. ▪ Bisexual & Pansexual – someone who is attracted to people of their gender or other gender identities is bisexual. It is considered restrictive since only the twin sexualities of men and women are included. Instead, the term pansexual is used to denote someone who is attracted to people of all gender identities. ▪ Asexual – someone who experiences little to no sexual attraction ▪ Intersex – individuals born with a combination of biological sex characteristics (including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals) which do not fit the typical definition of male and female bodies. ▪ Transgender – someone whose gender identity or expression is different from that of their biological sex. Someone born as a man (with male genitalia) who self-identifies as a woman, or vice versa is a transgender person. ▪ Non-Binary – someone who experiences a gender identity that is neither exclusively male nor female or is in between, or beyond both genders. They can be gender fluid (shifting between male and female), agender (without gender), third gender, or something else entirely. ARTICLE 21 ▪ Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in December 2000 when the Dutch parliament passed a landmark bill allowing same-sex couples to marry, divorce, and adopt children. ▪ Mexico allows same-sex marriages in some jurisdictions – Mexico City, Quintana Roo, and Coahuila. ▪ Going against its earlier position, the United States State Department under the Trump administration has worked closely with anti-L.G.B.T.Q. organizations and has systematically opposed the use of words like “gender” in United Nations resolutions. ▪ Same-sex relations are illegal in much of South and Central Asia, including in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Nepal has enacted some protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2015 a government-appointed panel recommended that lawmakers legalize same-sex marriage. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan allow people to register as a third gender in official documents. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON LGBTQIA+ ARTICLE 21 Historical Context ▪ Kinnar, or hijra as the third gender in India have been acknowledged and accepted by the society. Their presence is noted in ancient texts of Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Kama Sutra. They often held important political positions in court, as well as part of the entourage of kings and queens during the Mughal period, ▪ India also had a more open attitude to homosexuality before the Raj and there is ample evidence of it in medieval history, mythology and architecture. ▪ Criminalization of homosexuality, as well as the degeneration of the social position of kinnars can be traced to the British imperial rule. Modelled on the Buggery Act of 1533, Section 377 of the IPC was introduced in India in 1861, which made sexual activities \"against the order of nature\" illegal. ▪ As per section 377 it was a punishable act to have intercourse with any man, woman or animals against the order of nature – homosexuality and bisexuality were both outlawed. LGBTQIA+ IN INDIA ARTICLE 21 Current Indian Law ▪ The Preamble to the Indian Constitution mandates justice -- social, economic, and political equality of status – for all. ▪ The right of equality before law and equal protection under the law is guaranteed in Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. ▪ The 2018 five-judge bench SC Judgment scrapped Section 377 of IPC in a historic unanimous verdict. It recognized sexual orientation as a natural and inherent biological phenomenon and decriminalized adult consensual same-sex relationships. ▪ While it scrapped 377 – consensual sexual acts of adults such as oral and anal sex in private – on the grounds of being “irrational, arbitrary, and manifestly unconstitutional”, it retained intercourse with children and animals as a punishable criminal offence. ▪ Parliament passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 ▪ The government published the Draft Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 LEGISLATION AND AFFIRMATION ACTION ARTICLE 21 TIMELINE OF DEVELOPMENTS TOWARDS LGBTQIA RIGHTS IN INDIA ▪ Section 377 was introduced in 1861 by the British. ▪ AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan (ABVA), an NGO filed petition in Delhi High Court in 1994, seeking repeal of Section 377, but it failed to follow through. ▪ In 2001,Naz Foundation – another NGO – filed petition against Section 377 in Delhi High Court. The plea was dismissed in 2003, against which Naz Foundation filed an appeal. The SC directed the HC to reconsider the case. ▪ The Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality in July 2009 on the grounds that Section 377 violated Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. ▪ The SC overturned the High Court Judgment in December 2013.It however said that the Centre was free to amend the law. ▪ In April 2014,the Supreme Court of India ruled in National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) vs. Union of India that transgenders were the ‘third gender’ and the fundamental rights granted under the Constitution are equally applicable to them. ▪ A Private Member’s Bill to decriminalize homosexuality proposed by MP Shashi Tharoor was rejected in the Lok Sabha in 2015. ▪ In June 2016,five well-known LGBTQ activists filed a review petition in the SC over section 377. ▪ In August 2017,the SC held Right to Privacy as a fundamental right. It also observed that “sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy”. ▪ In September 2018,the Supreme Court also decriminalized adult consensual same-sex relationships in the Section 377 judgment review. ARTICLE 21 ▪ Definition of transgender – The Bill defines a transgender person as one whose gender does not match the gender assigned at birth. It includes transmen and trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons with socio-cultural identities, such as kinnar and hijra. ▪ The Act prohibits discrimination against a transgender person in relation to: ▪ Education ▪ Employment ▪ Healthcare ▪ access to, or enjoyment of goods, facilities, opportunities available to the public; ▪ right to movement ▪ right to reside, rent, or otherwise occupy property ▪ opportunity to hold public or private office ▪ access to a government or private establishment ▪ The Act contains special imperatives on behalf of the government to ensure proper health care facilities, employment and education opportunities for transgenders, and their right to reside and be included in their households. ▪ The Act states that the relevant government will take measures to ensure the full inclusion and participation of transgender persons in society. It must also take steps for their rescue and rehabilitation, vocational training and self-employment, create schemes that are transgender sensitive, and promote their participation in cultural activities. ▪ It calls for the creation of a National Council for Transgender persons (NCT) to advise the central government as well as monitor the impact of policies, legislation and projects with respect to transgender persons. KEY FEATURES OF TRANSGENDERS ACT, 2019 ARTICLE 21 ▪ The process by which a transgender certificate may be obtained is dubious and cumbersome. It also gives ultimate authority of issuing certification to the District Magistrate, without any specific guidelines. It does not recognize the right to self-identify one’s gender. ▪ It does not explicitly define what constitutes discrimination in the context of the transgender community. It also fails to specify punishment for those who discriminate against transgender persons. ▪ There is no mention of reservation in education and employment for the transgender community. ▪ It does not provide any means to improve the conditions related to begging. ▪ It does not mention any punishments for rape or sexual assault of transgender persons. ISSUES WITH TRANSGENDERS ACT DRAFT RULES, 2020 ▪ The centre released Draft Rules for Transgenders which specify the process of application and the manner of issuing identity certificate will be issued to them. ▪ Some key issues in the rules are problematic: ▪ The role of a clinical psychologist in the process of certification ▪ The mandatory 1 year residence period before application for certification ▪ Purpose for collection and sharing of certain data not specified ▪ Absence of specific welfare measures ARTICLE 21 ▪ The Transgenders Act, 2019 must be amended to make it more rational, inclusive and effective. ▪ Need for a multi pronged approach to deal with issue of prejudice and discrimination prevalent in society against them. Social sensitization forms the basis of an overhaul in perception of LGBTQIA+ persons. ▪ Initiatives like transgender bands, transgender police officers, and others should be encouraged as they can help in changing the approach of people /society. Increased visibility in the mainstream will also result in normalization of relations and higher acceptance. ▪ Need of sensitization of government bodies, especially related to Health, and Law and Order and increase awareness about the changed position of law among the masses. ▪ Need for a detailed anti-discrimination law that empowers the community. ▪ Indian Parliament should conduct a wide-ranging review of existing legal frameworks, repeal discriminatory laws, and address other gaps in the law that prevent LGBT persons from fully exercising their rights. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER TRANSGENDER RIGHTS ARTICLE 21 ABORTION Arguments for abortion Arguments against abortion ▪ Women have a moral right of control over their own bodies. ▪ The Right to abortion is imperative for gender equality. ▪ The Right to abortion is also imperative for individual women to achieve their full potential. ▪ Banning abortion leads to women resorting to other illegal and unsafe measures to terminate pregnancy, which puts them at risk. ▪ The Right to Life trumps the right of a person to control their own body: the fetus is not a ‘part’ of the woman’s body but a separate ‘person’ altogether, with a right to life. ▪ Abortion does not necessarily lead to women’s liberation. What is required instead, is societal moral and financial support to the mother. ▪ The easy access to abortion reduces government efforts in better care for mothers, and their children. ▪ Negative impact on the long-term physical and mental health of the women who undergo abortion. Introduction ▪ Abortion is the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus. ▪ In most cases, abortion is used to terminate unplanned pregnancies. It is also used to end pregnancies where the fetus is abnormal. Therapeutic abortions occur when the pregnancy put the mother’s health at risk ARTICLE 21 ▪ A 2017 report by the Guttmacher Institute found that 42% of women of reproductive age live in countries where abortion is either banned or allowed only in specific circumstances. ▪ Canada allows for elective abortion at any time in the pregnancy. ▪ UK – except Northern Ireland, women can freely obtain an abortion up to 24 weeks into their pregnancy. Terminations can be performed after this limit in exceptional circumstances, such as to save the life of the mother or because of a severe fetal abnormality. ▪ United States – The US Supreme Court decriminalised abortion across the country in the Roe v. Wade case, 1973. It also struck down the essence of spousal consent for abortion INTERNATIONAL POSITIONS ARTICLE 21 ▪ Data on Abortion ▪ The first national study of the incidence of abortion and unintended pregnancy in India, conducted jointly by International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, the Population Council, New Delhi, and the New York–based Guttmacher Institute an estimated that 15.6 million abortions were performed in the country in 2015. ▪ The abortion rate was 47 per 1,000 women aged 15–49 years; the estimated unintended pregnancy rate was 70 per 1,000 women in the same age group. ▪ Close to three in four abortions were achieved using MMA drugs from chemists and informal vendors, rather than from health facilities. ▪ Of the total abortions, 81 percent were through medical methods of abortion (or MMA); 14 percent used surgical methods; and remaining 5 percent were performed outside health facilities through typically unsafe methods. ▪ Another research on unsafe abortion published in 2019 in BMJ Global Health presents a different picture: analysis of pregnant women aged 15–58 years from nine states in the Indian Annual Health Survey (2010– 2013) showed that 67 percent of the abortions recorded were classified as unsafe. ▪ The above study also found that women with no male children were more likely to have an unsafe abortion compared with women who had at least one male child. ABORTION IN INDIA ARTICLE 21 ▪ Right to Privacy under Article 21 is applicable to abortion. ▪ The Right to abortion may be interpreted to come under the Article 21. The Article dictates the Right to life and personal liberty. It can also be understood that a woman, who has been given such a right, might enjoy her personal liberty and alter her body in any way she can. CONSTITUTIONAL UNDERPINNINGS TIMELINE OF DEVELOPMENT ▪ Except in cases where it is conducted to save the woman’s life, abortion was criminalized (for both the woman and abortionist) by the IPC, 1862 and CrPC, 1898. ▪ The Shah Committee carried out a comprehensive review of socio-cultural, legal and medical aspects of abortion, and in 1966 recommended legalization of abortion to prevent wastage of women’s health and lives on both compassionate and medical grounds. ▪ The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act was passed by the Parliament in 1971, legalizing abortion in India (apart from erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir). ▪ The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules and Regulations 1975 define the criteria and procedures for approval of an abortion facility, procedures for consent, keeping records and reports, and ensuring confidentiality. ▪ The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2002 was passed after a long consultative process with various stakeholders, and the amended Rules and Regulations came out in 2003. ▪ The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill, 2020 (MTP Bill) was passed in the Lok Sabha in March 2020, and is due to be discussed in the Rajya Sabha before it becomes an Act. ARTICLE 21 ▪ In Dr Jacob George v. State of Kerala, 1994 the Supreme Court ruled that a doctor not trained in medical termination of pregnancy conducts the surgery, he or she can be charged under IPC Section 314. ▪ In V. Krishnanan v. Government of Tamil Nadu, 2001, the High Court of Madras affirmed women's rights to choose in the context of continuing pregnancy. ▪ In Suchita Srivastava and anr v. Chandigarh Administration, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legal right of consent of mentally retarded persons under the MTP Act, 1971. It held that the state has an obligation to ensure a woman's reproductive rights as a component of her Article 21 rights to personal liberty, dignity, and privacy. ▪ In Laxmi Mandal v. Deen Dayal Hari Nagar Hospital, 2010 the Delhi High Court ruled that preventable maternal death represents a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. ▪ The Supreme Court in the Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh case, 2011 ruled that a wife undergoing vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, may lead to mental cruelty. ▪ In Ms. X v. Union of India & Others, 2016, the SC allowed a rape victim to abort her 24-week-old abnormal fetus as the pregnancy would pose a grave threat to the woman's mental and physical health. IMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS ARTICLE 21 ▪ The MTP Act decriminalised abortion without bringing an amendment to the IPC or abrogating the penal provisions. ▪ The MTP Act sets some limitations regarding the circumstances when abortion is permissible, the persons who are competent to perform the procedure, and the place where it could be performed. ▪ Abortion is possible within 12 weeks at the option of the pregnant woman. ▪ Abortion is also possible within an extended period of 20 weeks with the permission of a Medical Board consisting of not less than two persons. ▪ Shortcomings of the Act: ▪ Restrictive for women - their freedom of choice is limited to a situation when her health and life are in danger or when the child if born would suffer from the abnormalities detected. ▪ The Act is prejudiced against unmarried pregnant women. ▪ At all stages of the pregnancy, the healthcare providers, rather than the women seeking abortion, have the final say on whether the abortion can be carried out. ▪ The 20-week upper limit on the period in which abortion can be performed does not take into account extenuating circumstances; abnormalities in fetus can be detected even after 20-weeks into pregnancy. LEGISLATION REGARDING ABORTION MTP ACT, 1971 ARTICLE 21 MTP BILL, 2020 Provisions Issues with the Bill ▪ The Bill increases the time period within which abortion may be carried out according to the MTP Act, 1971. ▪ Changes proposed in conditions for terminating a pregnancy at different gestational periods: ▪ The Bill addresses the bias against unmarried women and allows them to terminate pregnancy due to failure of contraceptive method or device. ▪ It provides for the creation of a Medical Board for all states and union territories to decide on abortion cases after 24 weeks of pregnancy. ▪ Protection of privacy: medical practitioners who reveal the details of women who have undergone abortion to anyone except person authorized by law may be punished with up ▪ The final say remains with the medical practitioner. ▪ Based on the provisions of the Bill, for a case requiring abortion due to rape, that exceeds 24- weeks, the only recourse is through a Writ Petition. ▪ The Bill does not take into account the 75 percent shortage of authorized doctors to perform abortion, and restricts the procedure to doctors with specialization in gynaecology or obstetrics. ▪ It does not provide a time period in which the Medical Board must make its decision regarding termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks. ▪ Silent on transgender persons ▪ There is no provision for pregnant minors who may want to not disclose the pregnancy to anyone other than the doctor, but require ARTICLE 21 Challenges for access to Safe Abortion Factors: stigma, restrictive laws, poor availability of services, over-regulation of drugs, high cost, and conscientious objection of health-care providers. • Complex process surrounding the activity with unnecessary requirements like mandatory waiting periods, mandatory counselling, provision of misleading information, third-party authorisation, and medically unnecessary tests that delay care which delay care. • A shortage of trained staff and inadequate supplies and equipment are the primary reasons many public facilities don’t provide abortion care. ▪ Legislation – both national and international – should ensure that medical practitioners cannot refuse abortion services on conscience claims. These should be strictly regulated by the State. ▪ Availability and quality of abortion services in health facilities should be improved: increased training and certification of doctors; permitting nurses, AYUSH doctors (practitioners of indigenous medicine) and auxiliary nurse midwives to provide MMA. ▪ Quality of contraceptive services must be improved: availability in public health facilities, offering a wider range, counselling services, etc. ▪ Public health facilities should have the equipment and drug supplies necessary to provide surgical abortion care and MMA. ▪ Strategies that provide women with accurate information about how to use the MMA method safely should be implemented. ▪ Systems of accessible support networks for health care providers to combat stigma, isolation, stress, and burnout should be created and institutionalized. Recommendations ARTICLE 21 ▪ The Supreme Court will decide if Sections 3 and 5 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 ('MTP Act') violate Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950. ▪ The petition seeks to widen women’s access to safe abortions and grant them greater reproductive choices. It also asserted that the State has a positive obligation under Article 21 to guarantee the right to health. Therefore, the petitioners requested the establishment of safe abortion clinics to reduce maternal mortality. SWATI AGARWAL Vs. UNION OF INDIA ARTICLE 21 ▪ Euthanasia refers to the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering.With Greek roots, the word literally translates into ‘good death’ or ‘easy death’ and is also known as ‘mercy killing’. It is associated with people with terminal illness or who have suffered irreversible incapacitation and are undergoing incurable pain. ▪ The right to die or end one’s life is not a novel aspect of modern society. Instances of active euthanasia are found in the Greek civilisation. Debates about the justifiability of euthanasia on moral, religious and practical grounds, however, have been intrinsic to discussions on the theme. EUTHANASIA ARTICLE 21 ▪ I. Assisted Dying – It includes both physician-assisted “suicide” and voluntary active euthanasia. The difference lies in the degree of involvement and behaviour of the physician. Assisted suicide is the act of deliberately assisting another person to kill themselves. It entails making lethal means available to the patient to be used at a time of the patient’s own choosing, with no requirement of the physician’s participation. However, the risk of error in assisted suicide is higher than in voluntary euthanasia. ▪ II. Palliative Care – This is ‘end-of-life’ care which aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems. It intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The aim is to offer a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death. ▪ III. DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) – A DNR order means that a doctor is not required to resuscitate a patient if their heart stops and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering. Although DNRs can be regarded as a form of passive euthanasia, they are not controversial unless they are abused, since they are intended to prevent patients suffering pointlessly from the bad effects that resuscitation can cause: broken ribs, other fractures, ruptured spleen, brain damage ARTICLE 21 Arguments in favour of euthanasia include: ▪ Based on empathy and morality – it is a good human deed to relive someone of their pain where there is no scope for improvement. ▪ Right to die peacefully is part of Fundamental Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. ▪ Self-determination – Human beings should have the right to be able to decide when and how they die. ▪ Euthanasia enables a person to die with dignity and in control of their situation. ▪ Death is a private matter and should not involve intervention by the state. Arguments against euthanasia include: ▪ Distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant. ▪ Another moral dimension includes the weakening of society’s respect for value of human life. ▪ It does not take into account, and leaves no room for unexpected results and recovery. ▪ Allowing euthanasia will lead to deterioration of healthcare of the terminally ill and discourage research for new cures. ▪ Not all deaths are painful; palliative care also ensures relief from pain. ▪ Regulation of euthanasia, and ensuring zero that the process is not misused is a challenge. ▪ There is no room for changing one’s decision beyond a certain point even if one changes ARTICLE 21 ▪ The present law on euthanasia in India is a result of the landmark Supreme Court judgment in the Common Cause v. Union of India, 2018 case which legalised passive euthanasia and stated that the same was not an offence under IPC as it neither at par with murder, nor with attempt to suicide. ▪ The SC used religious texts and scriptures and references from schools of jurisprudence to indicate the moral sanction for ending the life of the terminally ill. ▪ It held that 'right to die' is a part of Article 21 of the Constitution, and a person has a right to live with dignity until his death. The judgment permitted the execution of a Living Will or advanced medical directives by declaring that a Living Will is a part of the right to live with dignity. The Apex Court also introduced guidelines to be followed while performing euthanasia, and a set of the procedures involved for executing a Living Will. ▪ A Living Will is a document contains a person’s wishes in case s/he becomes incapacitated and it must be executed by a patient who is of sound mind and is capable of understanding its consequences. EUTHANASIA IN INDIA ARTICLE 21 ▪ The first judgment to deal with the issue of euthanasia was the Maruti Shripati Dubal v. State of Maharashtra case, 1986 where the Bombay High Court declared that the rights have both negative and positive aspects. The right to life under Article 21 could therefore also be interpreted as the right not to live a forced life. ▪ In the P Rathinam v Union of India, 1994, the Supreme Court held that criminal penalties for suicide violate the constitutional right to life by amounting to a double punishment and it rendered Section 309 of the IPC unconstitutional. ▪ The above judgment was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1996 in Gian Kaur v. the State of Punjab, which pronounced the judgment that both active and passive euthanasia and assisted suicide is unlawful in India, and that the right to life did not include the right to die. ▪ The landmark judgment in 2011 in the Aruna Shanbaug v. Union of India was a major milestone wherein the SC held that passive euthanasia is legally valid in the country under exceptional circumstances, which allowed withdrawal of life support to patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). EVOLUTION OF LAWS ON PASSIVE EUTHANASIA ARTICLE 21 ▪ The Law Commission of India, in its 196th Report in March 2006, gave a clear definition and clarified the meaning of the terms related to euthanasia. ▪ The report recommended that there must be a law made to protect terminally ill patients who refuse medical treatment, artificial nutrition, or hydration from Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code. ▪ Laws should also be made to protect doctors who make the decision for incompetent patients in their interests. The commission recommended the law be called The Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients, Medical Practitioners) Act. ▪ The Law Commission re-examined passive euthanasia in 2012 and presented its recommendations in its 241st Report. While the report reiterated its previous recommendations, it clarified that palliative care may be given in any case to terminally ill patients and the government should devise schemes for the same. ▪ M R Rajagopal Committee presented its report to the government in July 2018 listing the parameters and the threshold values at which ‘passive euthanasia’ and ‘living will’ can be implemented in the state. INSTITUTIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARTICLE 21 ▪ The scope of transformation of mercy killing into murder for selfish gains must be reduced by introducing better regulations and laws. Since the issue deals with dignified life and death, utmost care must be taken to ensure informed decisions on part of the patients. ▪ The Parliament should frame legislation to replace the court’s guidelines that govern passive euthanasia. The process needs to be fast tracked due to the immense complexity of the guidelines laid down by the court. ▪ Many countries have sophisticated regimes on assisted dying while India has only just recognized a constitutional right to refuse medical treatment. The Supreme Court’s stand on active euthanasia may also be reconsidered. ▪ As per the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, Doctrine of Double effect has been defined as \"The doctrine (or principle) of double effect is often invoked to explain the permissibility of an action that causes a serious harm, such as the death of a human being, as a side effect of promoting some good end. It is claimed that sometimes it is permissible to cause such a harm as a side effect (or 'double effect') of bringing about a good result even though it would not be permissible to cause such a harm as a means to bringing about the same good end.\" The four factors associated with the Doctrine of Double effect of euthanasia are: ▪ 1. The good outcome must be accomplished freely of the bad one. ▪ 2. The action must be corresponding to the cause. ▪ 3. The action must be fitting. WAY FORWARD ARTICLE 21 ▪ While there is no universally accepted and legal definition of privacy, it broadly relates to the diverse modes by which people, personal information, certain personal property, and personal decision- making can be made less accessible to others. ▪ It is a Human and Natural Right enjoyed by every human being by virtue of their existence. ▪ It is a Fundamental Right emerging from guarantee of life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. ▪ The Right to Privacy is determined on a case-to-case basis due to the dynamic meaning of privacy. PRIVACY ARTICLE 21ARTICLE 21 ▪ Article 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2012, recognizes the respect for private and family life, home and communications. Article 8 mandates protection of personal data and its collection for a specified legitimate purpose. ▪ Around 80 countries in the world have enacted laws regarding privacy including Australia, Canada, UK, and South Africa. While there is no separate law and the term privacy is not mentioned in the United States constitution, right to privacy is seen as a part of Fourth Amendment rights. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON PRIVACY ▪ In MP Sharma v. Satish Chandra, 1954 the SC questioned and disagreed to the existence of a constitutionally protected right to privacy. ▪ In Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1962 while the SC invalidated a Police Regulation for nightly domiciliary visits on the grounds that it constituted “unauthorised intrusion into a person’s home and a violation of ordered liberty”, it held that the right to privacy was not guaranteed under Article 21. ▪ Supreme court judgments in 1975 (Gobind v. State of M.P) and 1978 (Smt. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India) held that right to privacy should be denied only on account of superior reasons which allow for infringement of such a right, and that the law and procedure authorising interference with right of privacy must also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive respectively. The 1975 judgment also held that right to privacy should go through the process of case-by-case development. EVOLUTION OF PRIVACY AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT ARTICLE 21 ▪ The court held in the R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra case, 1972 that telephonic conversations are private in nature which make phone tapping a violation of privacy. ▪ The Harvinder Kaur v. Harmander Singh, 1983 judgment extended right to privacy to gender priority wherein private life is protected from public portrayal. ▪ The Right to Privacy Bill, 2011. ▪ Justice AP Shah Committee on Privacy – 2012 ▪ In the landmark judgment in case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, 2017 the SC declared Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21. The court held that privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. ARTICLE 21 ▪ Information Technology Act, 2000 ▪ The IT Act provides for safeguard against certain breaches in relation to data from computer systems. It contains provisions to prevent the unauthorized use of computers, computer systems and data stored therein. ▪ The Act provides for payment of compensation (in civil cases) and punishment (criminal cases) in case of wrongful disclosure and misuse of personal data and violation of contractual terms in respect of personal data. ▪ Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 ▪ The Rules deal with protection of \"Sensitive personal data or information of a person\", including information relating to: passwords; financial information such as bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details; physical, physiological and mental health condition; sexual orientation; medical records and history; and biometric information. ▪ It provides for rules and guidelines to be followed by corporate bodies while dealing with personal sensitive data or information of people, disclosure of which is punishable under section 72A of the IT Act. GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN PRIVACY ARTICLE 21 Justice B N Srikrishna Committee Report, 2018 ▪ The committee was formed in August 2017, after the 2017 SC Judgment. ▪ The report on A Free and Fair Digital Economy highlighted that the relationship between service provider and the individual must be viewed as a fiduciary relationship, which implies obligation on part of service provider to deal fairly with personal data and use it only for authorised purposed. ▪ Its recommendations include creation of Data Protection Authority; restrictions on processing and collection of data; right to be forgotten; data localization, explicit consent requirements for sensitive personal data, etc. ▪ The committee recommended amendment of related laws including Information Technology Act, 2000, the Census Act, 1948, and the Aadhaar Act, 2016 to bolster their data protection framework. ARTICLE 21 The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 ▪ After deliberations, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 was approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, and tabled as The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 in Lok Sabha. It was referred to the Standing Committee, and is currently pending in the Lok Sabha. ▪ The Bill provides a framework for safeguarding the privacy of personal data of individuals (data principals) which is processed by entities (data fiduciaries). Data processing requires express consent of the data principal except in cases of medical emergency or when the State provides benefits or services. ▪ The Bill allows exemptions from many of its provisions when the data is processed in the interest of national security, or for prevention, investigation or prosecution of offences. ▪ Issues with the Bill: ▪ The provision exempting processing of personal data from most provisions of the Bill for prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of an offence is too broad. ▪ Mandatory local storage of data may lead to extra costs for the fiduciaries. ▪ Fiduciaries are required to inform the Data Protection Authority of data breach in cases where the data principal may be affected. The fiduciaries may not do so to protect their reputation. ▪ Important concerns about internet privacy arise due to social media companies being required to identify their users with the prescribed aim of combating fake news. This will lead to massive scale of data transfer to private entities, which violates user privacy and anonymity, thus defeating the original purpose of data protection. ARTICLE 21 INTRODUCTION ▪ incorporated in Part IV-A of the Indian Constitution by the 42nd Amendment ▪ recommendations of Swaran Singh Committee and the eleventh duty was added to the ten fundamental duties by the 86th Amendment. ▪ The true source of right is duty. If we all discharge our duties, rights will not be far to seek. If leaving duties unperformed we run after rights, they will escape us like will-o’-the-wisp, the more we pursue them, the farther they fly.” – Gandhi ▪ The historical background of the evolution of rights and duties, an analysis of eastern jurisprudence and inefficacious implementation of fundamental duties advances the importance of fundamental duties. Though non-justiciable, they are rules of law. ▪ The inclusion of fundamental duties has brought our Constitution in line with Article 29(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the same is also inspired by Article 59 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution and other Constitutions, Declarations and concepts. Thus, Article 51-A is in accord with the other countries and laws. FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES ▪ Duties are an ancient concept encompassed in the eastern jurisprudence as an aspect of human behaviour known as “Dharma” ▪ The concept of duties has its origin in the Vedas and they are in the form of religious commands. ▪ Epics like Bhagavad Geeta, Ramayana and Mahabharat, also enshrine duty as part of one’s Dharma. ▪ Thus, the eastern jurisprudence is duty oriented and right is considered as ancillary to duty or consequence of performing duty. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ▪ Whilst considering, the nature in which the fundamental duties were incorporated in the Indian Constitution during the period of Emergency with the 42nd Amendment coming into force and the majority of which was struck down by 44th Amendment leaving fundamental duties untouched, thereby, indicating even then how essential fundamental duties were. ▪ The 42nd Amendment was a controversial amendment which tried to circumvent and supersede the landmark judgment of Kesavananda Bharati,and reaffirmed by Supreme Court in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India. FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES ▪ JUSTICE VERMA COMMITTEE REPORT OF 1999: recommended that “duty to vote at elections, actively participate in the democratic governance and to pay taxes should be included in Article 51-A ▪ NATIONAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE WORKING OF CONSTITUTION: sensitise the people and create a general awareness of the provisions of fundamental duties amongst the citizens on the lines recommended by Justice Verma Committee. ▪ 86TH AMENDMENT: Article 51-A(k) – the duty of every parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child between the age of 6 and 14 years which corresponds to right to free and compulsory education in Article 21-A of the Constitution. FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES FDs & SC JUDGEMENTS ▪ Javed v. State of Haryana (2003) : the Supreme Court held that fundamental rights have to be read with fundamental duties and the Directive Principles of State Policy and they cannot be read in isolation. ▪ Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980) : merely because a rule is not backed by sanctions for disobedience, does not mean it has no importance. It is still regarded a rule of law that is expected to be followed ▪ Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum v. Union of India & Bandkhal and Surajkund Lakes : Supreme Court recognised ‘the Precautionary Principle’, ‘the Polluter Pays’ principle as essential features of ‘sustainable development’ and part of environment law of the country in view of Articles 21 and 51-A(g). ▪ M.C. Mehta v. Union of India : the Supreme Court made it compulsory for all educational institutes to organise a one-hour lecture on protecting and preserving the natural environment and made the Central Government duty-bound to make this a rule in all such institutes and make it a part of their curriculum and issued certain directions in general to the Central Government and citizens on maintaining a healthy ecology and preserving the natural environment FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES IMPLEMENTATION OF FDs POSSIBLE ADDITIONS Although not enforceable, Fundamental Duties gain some ground through other legislation ▪ Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, ▪ the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, ▪ the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, ▪ the Representation of the People Act, 1951, ▪ the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, ▪ the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 ▪ Duty to vote ▪ Duty to pay taxes (Vodafone case) ▪ Duty to help accident victims (Good Samaritan Law) ▪ Duty to keep premises clean (SBM) ▪ Duty to raise voice against injustice (POSCO) ▪ Duty to support bona fide civil society movements FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES ▪ The ultimate power of Judiciary to review and determine validity of a law or an order. ▪ The power of a court to inquire whether a law, executive order or other official action conflicts with the Constitution and if the court concludes that it does, to declare it unconstitutional and void. ▪ Judicial Review is one of the checks and balances to the doctrine of separation of powers. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM NEED/JUSTIFICATION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ▪ Supremacy of the Constitution : The judiciary is considered as the guardian of the Constitution upholding the rule of law by declaring any action void, if it is in violation of constitution and also to limit the arbitrary powers of the government in order to upholding constitutionalism. ▪ Ensuring separation of power by acting as a check and balance and putting the powers of the legislatures and the executives under some restraints and not making them uncontrolled and arbitrary ▪ Maintaining federal equilibrium : The justification of judicial review function can also be attributed to federal set up, as we have one Government at the Centre and one at the State level and both of them make law in their respective sphere. In case of inconsistency among these laws or the question of competency of law making, there should be an impartial body to adjudicate upon these issues, independent of any pressures. Hence in a federal State, judicial arbitration is inevitable in order to maintain balance between the Centre and the State. ▪ Where the Constitution guarantees the fundamental rights, legislative violation of the these rights can be scrutinized by the court alone. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM ▪ Failure of other organs in discharging their duties – Many times, several laws and schemes in the social and economic sectors have remained mere declaration of good intentions and when this happens it leads to an erosion of the confidence of the citizens in the constitutional values and democracy. In such a scenario, the judiciary steps into the areas usually earmarked for the legislature and executive. ▪ To fill legislative vacuum and meet societal needs the courts often indulge in judicial legislation thereby encroaching in the domain of legislature. NEED FOR JUDICIAL ACTIVISM JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM SUBJECTS OF JR- INDIA FEATURES OF JR- INDIA ▪ Violation of fundamental rights. ▪ Violation of various legal rights/constitutional restrictions. ▪ Enactment of statutes and other legislative/executive actions in violation of Constitutional mandate regarding distribution/separation of powers. ▪ Delegation of essential legislative power by the legislature to the executive or any other body. ▪ Violation of implied limitations and restrictions. ▪ Both Supreme Court and High courts exercise the power of judicial review but ultimate and final power to determine the constitutional validity lies with the Supreme Court. ▪ Judicial Review can be conducted in respect of all central and state laws. ▪ Judicial Review applies only to the questions of law, not questions of fact. ▪ Limitations - Judicial Review cannot be conducted on laws dealing with subjects in the ninth schedule of Constitution of India. ▪ Judicial Review cannot be undertaken suo moto by the courts. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM Advantages Disadvantages • Keeps misuse of power in check, maintains federal balance • Device for protection of people’s rights • Undemocratic- interferes with separation of powers doctrine • Lack of clearly defined system • Secures independence of judiciary • Helps Courts exercise their Constitutional duties • Fear of judicial tyranny and irresponsible Parliament • Reversal of previous decisions- subjectivity in judgement. Eg- Golaknath case judgement reversed the earlier judgements, and Kesavananda Bharati judgement reversed the Golaknath judgement JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM DIFFERENCES & DISTINCTIONS Judicial review Judicial activism Judicial overreach Definition Process by which judiciary reviews the validity of laws More active role taken by judiciary to dispense social justice; connected with enforceability When courts step into the shoes of the legislature and executive, in violation of SOP Origin Article 13 of the Constitution No constitutional backing No origin; undesirable in any democracy Examples Sec 66A of the IT Act was struck down for being in violation with FRs Introduction of Basic Structure, institutionalization of PIL, banning smoking in public places Allahabad HC, 2015- compulsory for bureaucrats to send their children to govt schools; All cinema halls to play national anthem before featuring film JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM JUDGEMENTS JUDICIAL REVIEW JUDICIAL ACTIVISM ▪ S. P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India - Justice P.N. Bhagwati, C.J. established that judicial review was a basic feature of Constitution. ▪ L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India - Bench stated: “that the power of judicial review over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Article 226 and in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting part of its basic structure”. ▪ Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India – The Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. ▪ Indian Young Lawyers’ Association v. State of Kerala – Allowed entry of women into the Sabarimala Temple. ▪ K.S. Puttaswami vs. Union of India – Right to Privacy declared a fundamental right under Article 21 and is enforceable against the State. ▪ Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan – The Supreme Court laid down guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment of women at the workplace, which was followed for nearly 16 years before the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013). JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM PROVISION GIST ARTICLE 13 Any law which contravenes any provision of the part of FRs shall be void ARTICLES 32 AND 226 Entrusts the roles of protector and guarantor of FRs to the SC and HCs ARTICLES 131-136 • Entrusts the SC with the power to adjudicate disputes between individuals, between individuals and the State, between States and the Union • The court may be required to interpret the provisions of the Constitution and the interpretation given by the SC becomes honored by all courts of the land ARTICLE 143 The Constitution u/A. 143 authorises the President to seek the opinion of the SC in two categories of matters: • On any quest of law or fact of public importance which has arisen or which is likely to arise • On any dispute arising out of pre-Constitution Treaty, agreement, Covenant, engagement or other similar instruments ARTICLE 145 Gives SC power to frame rules including rules regarding condition on which a person can practice before the Court ARTICLE 227 States that every HC shall have suprintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction (except a court formed under a law related to armed forces) ARTICLE 246(3) Ensures the State Legislature’s exclusive powers on matters pertaining to the State List ARTICLES 251 AND 254 States that in case of inconsistency between Union and State laws, the State law shall be void ARTICLE 372 (1) Establishes the Judicial Review of the pre-Constitution legislation CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM Judicial Activism is criticized primarily on two grounds – ▪ firstly, law making is the responsibility of the legislature only and ▪ secondly, judges are neither elected by the people nor are answerable to the. Therefore, since courts are not representative bodies reflecting the will of people , they aren’t competent enough to know what the people want. However , many scholars feel that judicial activism is democratic because there is accountability of the judges through their reasoning in their decisions. If the reasons are wrong the decisions are criticized, are set aside and reconsidered and this fosters accountability in them. Hence ,when executive and legislature are apathetic and fail to discharge their duties, bureaucracy is indifferent towards its duties, all this affects the basic rights of the people. Therefore, judiciary cannot turn a blind eye towards the laxity/ incompetency of the other two organs and has to step in to fill the gap. Does judicial activism undermine parliamentary democracy/ Has it taken over the role of executive and legislature? JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM ▪ Golakhnath case, Kesavananda Bharati case, Vishaka Guidelines, Abolition of adultery, decriminalisation of sec 377 IPC, abolition of Triple Talaq, protection of environment and ecology, abolition of bonded labour, ban on smoking in public places , in Olga Telis v/s Union of India, the court said that the outlines of Article 21 which provides right to life also include itself the Right to livelihood as well as shelter, creation of collegium system in Judges transfer case, institutionalization of PIL, provide mid-day meals to schoolchildren, witness protection scheme etc. ▪ Courts have also entered into the fields traditionally reserved for executive in order to improve the implementation of the law by using interim directions – in Shriram Fertilizer Gas Leak case it ordered the plant to be closed and setting up of victim compensation fund. In Dehradun Quarrying case, it closed limestone quarries in mussoorie, SC ordered the government to appoint a committee to look into the issues pertaining to bad loans, ordering the UPA government to set up SIT to investigate black money, asking to create a new policy to handle drought etc. ▪ But at times, it has been observed that the judges become too adventurous and indulge in Judicial overreach. E.g.- liquor ban, imposition of Patriotism in National Anthem Case, setting up of Lodha Committee to reform the Board of Control for Cricket in India which is a private body etc. JA: DETAILED EXAMPLES JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ACTIVISM ▪ Judicial Review is the inevitable response of the judiciary to ensure proper check on the exercise of public power. ▪ There is a thin line between Judicial activism and judicial overarch, just as independence of the judiciary is part of basic structure, the primacy of the legislature in policy making is also part of basic structure and interference by the courts into their domain is not always justified. Additionally, even the society at large should not indulge in Judicial romanticism by abusing the PIL ▪ It is not that a judge should never be an activist , but such activism should be done only in exceptional cases and ordinarily judges should exercise self-restraint and should limit their activism only in the cases where - such judicial legislation is for furthering the mandates of the constitution, or a legal norm is required by society for its smooth running and for some reason the legislature is unwilling or unable to create it, and when there is a gap in the statutory law. ▪ Given the crucial role of the judiciary in protection and even evolution of the law of the land, it is vital that the judiciary desist from passing ad hoc decisions without the backing of sound principles, particularly, when the decision appears to break new grounds.
