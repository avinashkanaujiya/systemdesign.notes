AWG: ●\t It is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to the study of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit. ●\t It was established in 2009 as part of the Subcom- mission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS), a constit- uent body of the International Commission on Stra- tigraphy (ICS). Earth’s\tgeological\ttimeline: ● The geologic time scale is the calendar for events in Earth’s history. ● It subdivides all time into units of abstract time called (in descending order of duration) - eons (about a bil- lion years), eras, periods, epochs, and ages. ● Each of these categories is further divided into sub-categories. For instance, Earth’s history is char- acterised by four eons, including - ○ Hadeon (oldest), www.insightsonindia.com3 ○ Archean, ○ Proterozoic, and ○ Phanerozoic (youngest). ● The enumeration of these geologic time units is based on stratigraphy, which is the correlation and classification of rock strata - which contains differ- ent kinds of fossils characterising different intervals of time. ● Officially, we’re in the Phanerozoic eon, Cenozoic era, Quaternary period, Holocene epoch and the Meghalayan age. The Holocene epoch: ●\t The Holocene is the current geological epoch, which began approximately 11,700 years ago. ●\t It follows the Last Glacial Period and the Holocene along with the preceding Pleistocene forms the Qua- ternary period. ● The Holocene, which has been identified with the current warm period, corresponds with the rapid proliferation,\t growth\t and\t impacts\t of\t the\t human\t species worldwide. What is the Anthropocene epoch? The\t term\t was\t first\t coined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen and biology professor Eu- gene Stoermer in 2000 Denotes The\tpresent\tgeological\ttime\tinter- val, in which the Earth’s ecosystem has gone through radical changes due to human impact, especially since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Phenomena associ- ated with this epoch Such as global warming, sea-lev- el rise, ocean acidification, mass- scale soil erosion, the advent of deadly heat waves, deterioration of the biosphere and other det- rimental changes in the environ- ment. Impact Many of these changes will persist for millennia or longer and are al- tering the trajectory of the Earth System, some with permanent ef- fects. What have the geol- ogists found? In a major development that could change the Earth’s official geolog- ical timeline, distinct and multiple signals show the start of the An- thropocene epoch around 1950, when human activity started to have a significant impact on the Earth. Evidence The presence of plutonium (due to the detonation of nuclear weapons) gives us a stark indica- tor of when humanity became such a dominant force that it could leave a unique global ‘fingerprint’ on planet Earth. But\t these\t find- ings don’t mean that they have proved the advent of the Anthro- pocene epoch.

GS Paper 2 TENURE EXTENSION SYSTEM: SC ASKS ED CHIEF TO QUIT Syllabus: Statutory, Regulatory and various Quasi-ju- dicial Bodies Context: The SC asked the ED Director to quit (4 months before his third extension ends) even as it upheld statutory amendments which facilitate the tenures of Directors of the CBI and the ED to be stretched. The\ttimeline\twhich\tleads\tto\tthe\trecent\tverdict: ● The current Enforcement Directorate (ED) Director (Mr SK Mishra) was appointed for a two-year term in 2018. ○ In 2020, the original appointment was retro- spectively amended to make it a three-year tenure. ●\t In 2021, the SC directed the government to stop giv- ing extensions to the ED Director. ●\t In order to tweak the above verdict, amendments were enacted in 2021 to the Central Vigilance Com- mission Act, the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.○ This allows a maximum of 3 annual exten- sions (taking a total term of 5 years) to the Directors of CBI and ED on the recommen- dation of High-Level\tCommittees. ○ Earlier, CBI and ED chiefs have fixed tenures of two years. ● He was given two annual extensions in 2021 and 2022, despite crossing the age of superannuation. www.insightsonindia.com4 The\tHigh-Level\tCommittees:\t ● A five-member panel composed of the Central Vig- ilance Commissioner and Vigilance Commissioners had to recommend if an ED Director was worthy of an extension in service. ● In the case of the CBI Director, a High-Level Commit- tee of the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader and the Chief Justice of India had to recommend. ● These committees were required to record reasons in\twriting in support of their recommendations. The recent verdict: ● The back-to-back service extensions given to the ED Director in 2021 and 2022 were illegal, as they were not as per the recommendations of the High-Level Committees. ●\t By upholding the 2021 amendments, the court dis- agreed with the argument that the Centre could use the service extensions as a ‘carrot\tand\tstick’\tpolicy - against the principle of insulating these agencies from government pressure. Takeaways from the SC’s verdict: ●\t A\t setback\t to\t the\t cause\t of\t protecting\t institutional\t independence. ○ While the part of the judgement quashing the extensions given to the ED Director, may be welcomed, the rest of it is a free pass to the government to undermine the autono- my of these agencies. ● Even though Parliament can remove the basis for any judgement through legislation, it cannot nullify a\tcourt\tdirection. ○ The Court’s earlier observation that such ex- tension should be given to those who have attained superannuation only in “rare and exceptional\tcases”, was ignored by the gov- ernment. Conclusion: At a time when there is a cloud of suspicion over the mis- use of government agencies against political opponents, the Court’s endorsement of a tenure extension system designed to undermine their independence is not conducive to the rule of law.

What is Moral atonement? It refers to the act of acknowledging and taking responsi- bility for one’s moral wrongdoings or harmful actions and seeking to make amends or seek forgiveness. It involves a sincere effort to make things right on a moral level. Recent Example: Netherlands will return hundreds of co- lonial-era artefacts — including a bejewelled, ceremonial cannon—to Sri Lanka. Also, British and German museums returned the so-called Benin Bronzes stolen from Nigeria during a large-scale 1897 British military expedition. Other examples: •\t Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016 apol- ogised on behalf of Canada for denying permission for the Indian immigrants on the Komagata Maru to land in Vancouver (in 1914), thereby sending most of them to their deaths. •\t Willy\t Brandt\t (Chancellor\tof\t Germany) sank to his knees at the Warsaw Ghetto in 1970 to apologise to Polish Jews for the Holocaust. Example from daily life: Imagine you accidentally break your friend’s favourite mug while visiting their house. You feel guilty and understand that you have caused them distress. To make moral atonement, you would take the following steps: •\t Acknowledge your mistake: Admit that you broke your friend’s mug and understand that it was your fault. •\t Apologize: Express sincere remorse for your actions and apologize to your friend for the damage caused. •\t Take responsibility: Offer to replace the mug or compensate your friend for its value as a way of tak- ing responsibility for your actions. •\t Learn from the experience: Reflect on what hap- pened and learn from your mistake. Promise to be more careful and considerate in the future. www.insightsonindia.com5 Other ethical words involved: Restitution refers to the act of returning or restoring something that was taken, stolen, or lost to its rightful owner. It involves making amends or compensating for past injustices or wrongdoings. •\t For example, returning cultural artefacts or artworks to their country of origin, which were acquired through colonialism or looting, can be seen as a form of resti- tution. Reparation refers to the act of making amends or provid- ing compensation for harm or injustice caused. It involves acknowledging and addressing past wrongs to achieve justice. •\t For example, providing financial\tcompensation\tor\tsup- port\tto\tindividuals\tor\tcommunities\twho\twere\tvictims\t of slavery or other forms of historical oppression can be considered reparations. Insta Links: Essence Determinants and Consequences of Ethics Content for Mains Enrichment MUSK CALLS ZUCK A ‘CUCK’ The launch of Meta’s\tsocial\tmedia\tplatform\tThreads led to heightened tensions between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Musk called Zuckerberg a “cuck” in a tweet, follow- ing a screenshot of a conversation between Zuckerberg and Wendy’s. Ethical Issues: The ethical issues involved in Musk calling Zuckerberg a “cuck” include the use of derogatory language, perpetuating misogyny, and engaging in online harassment. This behaviour promotes a toxic online environment and undermines\trespectful\tcommunication. Usage: The example can be used to show how leaders/Ce- lebrities\tshould\tnot\tbehave\tin\tpublic\tspaces.\t HUMAN-STRAY\tDOG\tCONFLICT Context: The Supreme Court of India has agreed to hear dif- ferent perspectives to find\ta\thumane\tand\tlong-lasting\tsolu- tion to conflicts between humans and stray dogs, particular- ly in the state of Kerala. •\t The court was responding to a plea by the Kannur dis- trict panchayat to euthanize stray dogs deemed to be “suspected rabid” and “extremely dangerous.” Two views: •\t View 1: Advocates\trepresenting\tthe\tdistrict\tpanchayat highlighted the case of an 11-year-old boy who was fa- tally attacked by stray dogs. Several such cases of dog attacks have come across throughout India. •\t View 2: Animal\trights\tactivists emphasized that local au- thorities should strictly implement animal birth control rules and prevent cruelty towards stray dogs. Instances of hanging, poisoning, and drowning of stray dogs have been reported, and activists are advocating for their pro- tection The ethical issues involved in the human-stray dog conflict include the treatment of animals, the balance between hu- man safety and animal rights, and the implementation of ef- fective and humane solutions. Use: The issue can be taken as a case study from the ethical point of view and dilemmas involved in finding a humane solution. Facts for Prelims (FFP) KUI LANGUAGE Context: The state cabinet of Odisha has approved the rec- ommendation to include the Kui language in the eighth schedule\tof\tthe\tConstitution\tof\tIndia.\t Kui Language •\t Kui language is a vernacular tribal language of Odi- sha. •\t It is also referred to as Kandh, Khondi, Kanda, Kodu, Kuinga. •\t It is a South-Eastern Dravidian language mainly spo- ken by the Kandhas or Kondhs. •\t It\tis\twritten\tin\tthe\tOdia\tscript. According to information available on the UNESCO site, the Koi language status situation is potentially vulnerable. Significance\tof\tinclusion\tin\tthe\t8th\tschedule •\t The inclusion of the Kui language in the 8th schedule will help in the preservation,\tpromotion\tand\tpropa- gation\tof\tthis\tlanguage\tand\tassociated\tculture. SANGAM LITERATURE Context: The Tamil\tNadu\tText\tBook\tand\tEducation\tServices\t Corporation has published a collection of ten idylls called Patthuppattu, one of the earliest Sangam poetry collections. •\t The publication pays tribute to U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer, dedicated himself to finding ancient palm leaf manuscripts containing Tamil literary works. www.insightsonindia.com6 About Sangam Period: •\t The Sangam period or age, particularly referring to the third Sangam period, is the period of the his- tory of ancient Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Sri Lanka (then known as Tamilakam), spanning from c. 6th century BCE to c. 3rd century CE. •\t Historians and Ideologists regard the Sangam period as the ‘classical age’ of the Tamils analogous to the age of the classics in Greece and Rome and to that of the Renaissance of later period in Europe. •\t The term ‘Sangam’\tliterally\tmeans\t‘confluence’ SHELF CLOUD Context: A viral video on social media shows the formation of spectacular clouds known as shelf clouds or Arcus clouds during heavy monsoon rains in Haridwar, India. •\t The video, shared on Twitter, depicts a towering wall\t of\t clouds\t with\t a\t horizontal\t rotation. The au- thenticity of the video has not been independently confirmed. About Shelf Clouds: Shelf clouds are wedge-shaped\tformations\t that\t appear\t on the leading edge of storms. They occur when cold and dense air is forcefully driven into a warmer air mass during the\tdowndraft\tof\ta\tthunderstorm. How it is formed? Shelf clouds form when\twarm,\tmoist\tair\tis\tlifted\trapidly\tby\t an advancing thunderstorm or cold front. As the warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming a cloud. The rising air creates a boundary between the cool, downdraft air from the storm and the warm, updraft air ahead of it. The shelf cloud is usually dark and ominous-looking due to the con- densation and the presence of rain or hail within the storm. ASSOCIATION OF WORLD ELEC- TION\tBODIES\t(A-WEB) Context: Chief Election Commissioner Shri Rajiv Kumar led a delegation from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to attend the 11th\tmeeting\tof\tthe\tExecutive\tBoard\tof\tthe\tAs- sociation\t of\t World\t Election\t Bodies\t (A-WEB)\tin Cartagena, Colombia.

Advantages: The interoperability of QR codes will facili- tate\tmore\ttransactions\tusing\tcentral\tbank\tdigital\tcurrency\t (CBDC). Previously, merchants had to go through a separate onboarding process and have a specific QR code for CBDC, causing delays. In 2022, RBI launched CBDC, known as the Digital Rupee. It is a digital form of currency issued and regulated by RBI, representing a digitized version of India’s official currency. It is based on blockchain technology. It is being issued in the same denominations as paper currency and coins. CHANGE IN COLOUR OF WORLD’S OCEAN Context: A new study published in Nature reveals that cli- mate change has caused a change in the colour of 56 per cent of the world’s oceans. •\t The study found that waters in the tropics, partic- ularly the southern Indian Ocean, have turned green. Green-coloured water indicates an increase in phytoplankton, microscopic plant-like organisms that are crucial for marine life and carbon dioxide absorption.\t Phytoplankton, which are microscopic plant-like or- ganisms that live in the ocean. Phytoplankton contains chlorophyll, a pigment that gives them a green colour. The change in ocean colour is an indicator of alterations\t in\tthe\tphytoplankton\tcommunities. The researchers analysed data from the Moderate Resolu- tion\tImaging\tSpectroradiometer\t(MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite, which has been monitoring ocean colour for two decades. They observed long-term trends and used mod- els to simulate scenarios with and without greenhouse gas emissions. BRUCELLOSIS Context: A seven-year-old student from Kollam, India, has tested\tpositive\tfor\tBrucellosis, a bacterial infection that can spread from animals to humans. •\t The girl was admitted to the hospital with symptoms including severe fever, increased platelet count, and a swollen face. About Brucellosis: Brucellosis is commonly\tfound\tin\tcattle,\tand\thumans\tcan\t contract\tthe\tinfection\tthrough\tclose\tcontact\twith\tanimals\t or animal products. If not treated promptly, the infection\t can be life-threatening. GUILLAIN-BARRE\tSYNDROME Context: Peru has declared a state of national emergency due to a surge in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neuro- logical disorder that can lead to paralysis. •\t The country has witnessed an “unusual increase” in cases, prompting concerns about the strain on health services. The health minister expressed concerns about a potential shortage of immunoglobulin, a standard treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome. www.insightsonindia.com8 About Guillain-Barré syndrome: Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare disorder where the im- mune\t system\t mistakenly\t attacks\t the\t peripheral\t nervous\t system. It can range from mild weakness to severe paral- ysis.\tThe\tcauses\tare\tstill\tunknown.\tAlso,\tthere is no known cure. However, treatments can help alleviate symptoms and complications. DUDHWA TIGER RESERVE Context: Four tigers died within two months in the Dudhwa Tiger\tReserve\tin\tUttar\tPradesh, India. Dudhwa Tiger Reserve: •\t The Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is a protected area in Ut- tar Pradesh located on the India-Nepal border. •\t It stretches mainly across the Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich districts. •\t It is the only place in Uttar Pradesh where both Ti- gers\tand\tRhinos\tcan\tbe\tspotted\ttogether. •\t It is one of the finest examples of exceedingly di- verse\tand\tproductive\tTerai\tecosystems.

Mapping ECUADOR The port city of Guayaquil in Ecuador (a route for cocaine trafficking\t from\t neighbouring\t Colombia\t to\t the\t United\t States and Europe) is grappling with a devastating\tbattle\tfor\t control among criminal gangs, leaving the country broken. The violence has escalated dramatically in recent years, mak- ing Ecuador\tthe\tfourth\tmost\tviolent\tcountry\tin\tLatin\tAmer- ica, surpassed only by Venezuela, Honduras, and Colombia. Ecuador is on South America’s west coast. Its diverse land- scape encompasses the Amazon jungle, Andean highlands and the wildlife-rich Galápagos Islands. Ecuador’s role in the drug trade dates back to the 1980s, when it was a transit route for Peruvian coca base trafficked into Colombia.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
