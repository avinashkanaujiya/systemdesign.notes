Cooperatives in India and issues faced by them: Meaning: Co-operatives are voluntary, democratic, and au- tonomous organisations controlled by their members who actively participate in its policies and decision-making. Efforts to promote them: ● After independence, the first five-year plan (1951- 56) emphasised the adoption of co-operatives to cover various aspects of community development. ● 97th Amendment (2011): It inserted Article 43B in the DPSP of the Indian Constitution inserted, ○ As per Article 43B. States shall endeavour to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and profes- sional management of cooperative societ- ies. Issues faced by the co-operatives: ● Inadequacies in governance ● Politicisation and the excessive role of the govern- ment ● Inability to ensure active membership ● Lack of efforts for capital formation ● Inability to attract and retain competent profes- sionals ● Elections to co-operative boards have been post- poned indefinitely What are Multi-state Co-operative Societies? ● Regulated by the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act 2002, these are societies that have operations in more than one state (like FPOs). ● Part IXB (also inserted by the 97th amendment) of the Indian constitution is applicable only to multi- state co-operative societies (as per an SC verdict), as states have the jurisdiction to legislate over state co-operative societies. www.insightsonindia.com3 About the Multi-State Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill 2023: It seeks to amend the Multi-State Co-operative Soci- eties Act 2002. Key features 2002 Act 2023 Bill Election of board members Elections to the board are conducted by its existing board. Co-operative Election Authority: The central govern- ment will establish the Authority to conduct such elec- tions. It will consist of a chairperson, VC, and up to 3 members appointed by the central government on the recommendations of a selection committee. Amalgamation of co-operative soci- eties Amalgamation and division by passing a resolution at a general meeting with at least two-thirds of the members present and voting. Allows state co-operative societies to merge into an existing multi-state co-operative society, subject to the respective state laws. Fund for sick co- operative societ- ies Co-operative Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and De- velopment Fund: Multi-state co-operative societies that are in profit for the preceding three financial years shall finance the Fund. Restriction on re- demption of gov- ernment share- holding The shares held in a multi-state co-oper- ative society by certain government au- thorities can be redeemed based on the bye-laws of the society. Any shares held by the central and state governments cannot be redeemed without their prior approval. Redressal of com- plaints Co-operative Ombudsman: The central government will appoint one or more such Ombudsman with terri- torial jurisdiction. They shall complete the process of inquiry and adjudica- tion within 3 months from the receipt of the complaint. Appeals (within a month) → Central Registrar appoint- ed by the central government. Importance of the Bill: ● By increasing their transparency and implementing a system of frequent elections, it will strengthen cooperatives. ● The Bill aims to address issues with the operation and governance of cooperative societies as well as match its pro- visions with those in Part IXB of the Constitution. Issues related to the Bill: ● Imposing a cost on well-functioning societies: Sick multi-state co-operative societies will be revived by a Fund that will be financed through contributions by profitable multi-state co-operative societies. ● Dilute autonomy and independence of co-operatives: By empowering the government to restrict redemption of its shareholding in multi-state co-operative societies.

Founding members: ● As many as 39 multinational corporations (MNCs) from sectors such as steel, FMCG, electronics came together to join RECEIC. ● They pledged to adopt resource efficiency and cir- cular economy principles to address environmental challenges rising from waste, including plastics, mi- croplastics, e-waste, and chemical waste. What is the RECEIC? ● Conceptualised by India’s G20 Presidency, it is en- visaged to be industry-driven and a self-sustaining initiative continuing to function even beyond India’s G20 Presidency. ● The mission of this coalition is to - ○ Facilitate and foster greater compa- ny-to-company collaboration, ○ Build advanced capabilities across sectors and value chains, ○ Bring learnings from the diverse and global experiences of the coalition members, and ○ Unlock on-ground private sector action to enhance resource efficiency and accelerate circular economy transition. ● The coalition is structured around the 3 guiding pil- lars of partnerships for impact, technology coopera- tion and finance for scale. Significance of RECEIC: ● It would play a pivotal role in promoting alliances, encouraging technological cooperation and knowl- edge transfer, fostering innovation, and facilitating the exchange of insights to enhance access to fi- nance. ● It will contribute towards progress on key global goals and priorities set by the G20 and other inter- national fora. ● RECEIC will also act as an overarching platform en- abling industries to address information gaps and coordination challenges across the G20 members. Other efforts of the Indian government to promote a circu- lar economy: ● The E-Waste (Management) Rules 2016: To curb the improper disposal of electronic products and to pro- mote sustainable e-waste management practices. ● The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2022: ○ It establishes Extended Producers’ Respon- sibility (EPR) guidelines. EPR is an environ- mental protection strategy that makes the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life cycle of the product. ○ Under this, 2.6 million tonnes worth of EPR certificates had been generated by plastic waste processors and around 1.51 million tonnes of those certificates had been pur- chased by PIBOs (Producers, Importers and Brand owners). ● Swachh Bharat Mission - Urban 2.0: The focus is on source segregation of garbage, utilising the 3Rs (re- duce, reuse, recycle), scientific processing of munic- ipal solid waste, etc. Challenges for circular economy in India: ● Industries are reluctant to adopt the circular econ- omy model due to supply chain limitations, lack of incentives to invest in recycling and remanufacturing processes, etc. ● Many people in India are not familiar with the con- cept of a circular economy and its benefits. ● India’s current infrastructure may not be well- equipped to support a circular economy. For exam- ple, insufficient recycling facilities and waste man- agement systems. ● There is a cultural resistance to the idea of reusing and recycling products in India. Conclusion: Industry-led coalition on resource efficiency and circular economy has the potential to transform aspirations into con- www.insightsonindia.com5 crete actions. However, behavioural changes are an import- ant prerequisite for this transformation.

GS Paper 3 THE STATE OF CLIMATE IN ASIA 2022 Syllabus: Environment and Conservation Context: According to the State of climate in Asia 2022 report released by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Asia is the world’s most disaster-prone region. About the report: ● One of a series of WMO regional State of the Climate reports, it was released during a meeting of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s (ESCAP) Committee on Disaster Risk Reduc- tion. ● UN ESCAP (HQ: Bangkok; founded in 1947) is one of the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Highlights of the report: ● Over 50 million people were directly affected due to 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters in Asia during 2022. ● The number of disaster events in the region de- creased in comparison to 2021 (over 100 natural hazards). ● But the effects of such events in 2022 were much more pronounced, with an increase in the number of fatalities, people affected and economic damage. ○ For example, ~5,879 Asians died due to nat- ural disasters in 2022 - 55% more than in 2021. ● The economic cost of the damage has been over $ 36 billion and Pakistan accounted for 42% of this. Floods and droughts in 2022: ● The economic losses associated with floods exceed- ed the average over the past 20 years (2002-2021). ○ This was primarily due to the significant eco- nomic losses from floods in Pakistan (over $15 billion), China (over $5 billion) and India (over $4.2 billion) ● The economic losses associated with drought ($7.6 billion), mainly occurred in China, exceeding the 20- year average by nearly 200%. ○ If compared with 2021, the economic cost of drought had more than doubled. Challenges ahead: ● Asia, the continent with the largest land mass ex- tending to the Arctic, is warming faster than the global average. ○ In 2022, the estimated mean temperature over Asia was 0.73°C above the 1991-2020 average, making it either the second/ third warmest year on record. ● Global melting ice, glaciers and sea level rise, threatening more socio-economic disruption in the future. ○ For example, in the north-east Indian Ocean and western tropical Pacific region sea level is rising at the rate of above 4 mm per year. ● The expected increase in the frequency and severi- ty of extreme events over much of Asia will impact agriculture. ○ More than 25% of all climate-related loss and damage is associated with the agricul- ture sector. Way ahead: ● As early warnings are one of the most effective ways of reducing damage from disasters, significant gaps to be addressed to strengthen these systems. ● Agriculture sector must be central in all climate ad- aptation planning.

Based on simulations, if the glacier continues to retreat at a similar rate, the study predicts that three lakes of different sizes may form due to subglacial over-deepening. There are two main reasons for the rapid melting of the glacier: •\t First is global warming and increasing temperatures in the region •\t Second is that it is at a lower altitude than other gla- ciers in the Zanskar region About the glacier: Parachik Glacier is a mountain glacier in Kargil, Ladakh. It is a mass of ice moving slowly down the Nun-Kun slopes. This ice mass falls finally into the Suru River. It is one of the larg- est glaciers in the Suru River valley, covering an area of 53 square km and is 14 km long. The Suru River valley is a part of the southern Zanskar Ranges in the western Himalayas GULF STREAM Context: A scientific study has raised concerns that the Gulf Stream system, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturn- ing Circulation (AMOC), could collapse as early as 2025. •\t The AMOC drives the Atlantic’s currents and plays a crucial role in determining Europe’s weather. If it were to collapse, it could lead to lower tempera- tures and catastrophic climate impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most re- cent assessment suggests that the collapse of AMOC may not happen as quickly as the study proposes. The complexi- ty of the climate system makes it difficult to have certainty about the exact timing and occurrence of such a collapse. About Gulf Stream: The Gulf Stream is a powerful ocean current in the North Atlantic Ocean. It originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows north-eastward along the eastern coast of the Unit- ed States, then across the Atlantic towards Europe. It plays a significant role in regulating the climate by transporting warm water and heat from the tropics to higher latitudes, influencing weather patterns and temperatures in coastal regions. About AMOC: It is a large system of ocean currents. It is the Atlantic branch of the ocean conveyor belt or ThermoHaline Circu- lation (THC) and distributes heat and nutrients throughout the world’s ocean basins. •\t AMOC carries warm surface waters from the trop- ics towards the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools and sinks. It then returns to the tropics and then to the South At- lantic as a bottom current. From there it is distributed to all ocean basins via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The ACC is the most important current in the Southern Ocean, and the only current that flows completely around the globe. SELF-RELIANT INDIA FUND Context: As part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, the Indian government announced a Rs. 50,000 crore Equity In- fusion for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through the Fund of Funds. The initiative aims to provide equity funding to viable and promising MSMEs to help them grow and become larger units. •\t The Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund has been estab- lished to implement this plan, with Rs. 10,000 crores contributed by the Government of India and Rs. 40,000 crores from Private Equity and Venture Capital funds. •\t The SRI Fund operates through a mother-fund and daughter-fund structure for equity or quasi-equity www.insightsonindia.com7 investments. The NSIC Venture Capital Fund Limit- ed (NVCFL) is registered as the Mother Fund under the SRI Fund implementation. The government has also taken several other initiatives to support the MSME sector, including the launch of the Cham- pions 2.0 portal, the MSME Champions Scheme for financial assistance, budgetary support to Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro & Small Enterprises, and the “Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP)” program aimed at strengthening MSMEs’ access to credit and markets and promoting technology upgradation. COLOMBO SECURITY CONCLAVE (CSC) FRAMEWORK Context: A successful joint expedition of ocean scientists from India, Bangladesh, and Mauritius, organized under the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) framework. •\t The expedition onboard ORV Sagar Nidhi was the first of its kind under the CSC framework, Objective: •\t To enhance ocean observation and data collection to predict and manage changes in the Indian Ocean’s regional environment. •\t Fostering collaboration in measuring and model- ling ocean parameters for better forecasting and services in the region. About CSC Aspect Details What is Colombo Security Conclave? The CSC is a trilateral maritime se- curity grouping formed in 2011, consisting of India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Mauritius is the fourth member, and Bangladesh and Sey- chelles attended as observers with invitations to join the group.

It also aims to counter China’s influence in the region and reduce the Chinese footprint in member countries. RBI’S DIGITAL PAYMENTS INDEX (RBI-DPI) Context: According to RBI data, digital payments in India saw a year-on-year growth of over 13% at the end of March 2023. •\t The RBI’s Digital Payments Index (RBI-DPI) reached about 395 compared to 377 in September 2022. Reason for the increase: •\t The increase in the index was attributed to substan- tial growth in payment infrastructure and perfor- mance across the country. About DPI: The DPI (Digital Payments Index) assesses the level of digita- lization in payments nationwide and showcases the growth of different digital payment methods. It is released semi-an- nually and consists of five main parameters with varying weights: •\t Payment Enablers (weight 25%) •\t Payment Infrastructure – Demand-side factors (10%) •\t Payment Infrastructure – Supply-side factors (15%) •\t Payment Performance (45%) •\t Consumer Centricity (5%) SEMICONINDIA 2023 Context: Prime Minister inaugurates SemiconIndia 2023 in Gujarat, emphasizing India’s potential to become a global semiconductor hub and its commitment to innovation and technology.

It plays a crucial role in pro- viding services for weather, climate, ocean, hydrology, and seismology. ANCIENT PATHOGENS RELEASED FROM MELTING ICE COULD WREAK HAVOC ON THE WORLD Context: The article discusses the potential risks associated with the release of ancient pathogens from melting ice in response to global warming. •\t For example, recently a 30,000-year-old virus was revived from Siberian permafrost, and an anthrax outbreak was linked to the thawing of spores in western Siberia. •\t The warming climate, particularly in colder regions like the Arctic, is accelerating the melting of ice, potentially releasing vast numbers of microorgan- www.insightsonindia.com9 isms, including ancient pathogens. However, the ex- act risk posed by these pathogens to modern eco- systems remains uncertain. A new study published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology used simulations to estimate the ecological risks of releasing ancient pathogens. The results showed that just one percent of simulated releases of a single dormant pathogen could lead to significant environmental damage and widespread loss of host organisms worldwide. •\t While the risk from a single pathogen might seem small, the sheer number of ancient microbes being released increases the overall danger. •\t If these pathogens were to establish themselves in modern environments, they could become a po- tent driver of ecological change, potentially leading to species extinction. Although the study did not model the potential risk to hu- mans, there is a concern that these “time-travelling” patho- gens could enter human populations through zoonotic pathways, similar to how viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV likely originated from animal hosts. Mapping LAO PDR (LAOS) During the 3rd round of Foreign Office Consultations, five MoUs were signed between India and Laos for Quick Im- pact Projects in education, health, water facility, and IT. Both countries have deep religious and people-to-people con- nections, fostering excellent political relations. Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) are small-scale initiatives or programs that are designed to deliver tangible and immedi- ate benefits to specific communities or areas. These projects aim to address pressing needs, provide assistance, or create positive changes quickly and efficiently. Laos is a Southeast Asian country traversed by the Mekong River and is known for its mountainous terrain, French co- lonial architecture, hill tribe settlements and Buddhist mon- asteries. NIGER In Niger, the military coup has led to the detention of Pres- ident Mohamed Bazoum. The coup plotters have named General Abdourahamane Tchiani as the new leader, citing security concerns related to jihadist violence. Niger or the Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa. It is a unitary state bordered by Libya to the northeast, Chad to the east, Nigeria to the south, Benin and Burkina Faso to the southwest, Mali to the west, and Algeria to the northwest. Over 80% of its land area lies in the Sahara (Sahel Region). Niger’s history of coups and its vulnerable position in the Sa- hel region make the situation complex and closely watched by the international community. www.insightsonindia.com10 PAPUA NEW GUINEA India and Papua New Guinea signed a Memorandum of Un- derstanding (MoU) on sharing INDIA STACK, successful digi- tal solutions implemented at the population scale, following the Global DPI Summit organized by MeitY in Pune.
