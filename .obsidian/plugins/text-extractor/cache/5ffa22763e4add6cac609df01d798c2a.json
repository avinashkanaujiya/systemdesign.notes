Palliative care Introduction • India has experienced a steep rise in the burden of lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases. • Nearly 1.4 million people are diagnosed with cancer in India every year while diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory diseases are also on the rise. • All these diseases need palliative care sooner or later in the disease trajectory. Palliative care • Palliative care is the branch of medicine focusing on improving the quality of life and preventing suffering among those with life-limiting illnesses. • It aims to address the physical, psychological, spiritual, and social domains of the health of people suffering from life-limiting diseases. • It supports the affected families in a way that focuses on the person as a whole, not just the disease. • The global need for palliative care will continue to grow as a result of the ageing of populations and the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases. Palliative care in India • Palliative care in India has largely been available at tertiary healthcare facilities in urban areas. • It is accessible to only 1-2% of the estimated 7-10 million people who require it. National Programme for Prevention & Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD) Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • The programme envisaged the provision of promotive, preventive, and curative care from the primary to tertiary institutes. • Thus, it provides health services delivery across the continuum of care. Concerns / Challenges • 55 million people in India are pushed below the poverty line every year due to health-related expenditures. • The revised NP-NCD guidelines mention palliative care in synonymy with cancer only. • The guidelines have also skipped an opportunity to bring focus on children suffering from chronic diseases. • Palliative care is provided for relief rather than to cure the symptoms and suffering caused by cancer. • Lack of a dedicated budget has prevented the implementation of National Programme for Palliative Care (NPPC). • Regulations for morphine and other essential controlled palliative medicines deny access to adequate palliative care. Way Forward • Palliative care must be delivered at least at the health and wellness centre and sub-center level. • Palliative care must be integrated into health systems at all levels. • Include palliative care along with curative treatment. • It is high time we realise the pandemic of non-communicable diseases in India and strengthen the palliative care services.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
