[10/150] 2020 The judicial systems in India and UK seem to be converging as well as diverging in the recent times. Highlight the key points of convergence and divergence between the two nations in terms of their judicial practices. [10/150] PREVIOUS YEARS’ QUESTIONS Breaking down Basics ➢ Democratic System of governance is broken down into two basic forms: Parliamentary and Presidential forms. ➢ Systems with features of both forms also exist as hybrids. ➢ Democratic governments can be classified on the basis of the relationship between the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary,and the extent of separation of powers between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. ➢ Accountability of the Executive to the Legislature distinctly differentiates between the two basic forms. Forms of Government ➢ Form of governance in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is ➢ separate from the legislative branch. ➢ The Head of State is also the designated Head of Government – and is called the President. ➢ Executive is constitutionally independent of Legislature. ➢ Presidentialism is the dominant form of governance in mainland Americas – 19 out of 22 sovereign states – and is also widespread in Central Asia, Central and Southern West Africa.The only republics to follow this system in Europe are Belarus and Cyprus. ➢ The United States of America is the perfect example of Presidential governance. ➢ Each of the three branches – judiciary, executive and legislative – are independent of the others,deriving authority from the constitution. WHAT IS PRESIDENTIAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT? Forms of Government ➢ Separation of Powers:Executive and Legislature are at par.Neither President nor Cabinet members are part of/responsible to Legislature. ➢ System of Checks and Balances exists in the following forms – ➢ Executive in form of the President has Veto power over Legislative. ➢ Legislature is enabled with power to remove President by the process of impeachment. ➢ Judiciary – Supreme Court – has the power to declare the Legislature’s laws, and Presidents orders as unconstitutional. ➢ Single Executive:Unlike Parliamentary form,here the President is the real Head of State as well as Head of Government.There is no concept of a titular/nominal Head. ➢ Prominent Position:President occupies a pre-eminent position in the Government and has subordinate members of Cabinet whose advice he may accept or reject. ➢ Fixed Term: Removal before completion of the President’s fixed term is possible only through impeachment on the basis of constitutional violation. FEATURES OF PRESIDENTIAL FORM OF GOVERNANCE Forms of Government Merits Demerits Separation of Powers ensures each organ its individual liberty giving no single organ superior powers. Risk of being a despotic nature of governance, as President is not answerable to the Legislature. Presidential system is speedy and responsive in emerging situations. Since Cabinet secretaries are appointed directly by the President, personal loyalty and ties play an important role. Prompt decisions can be taken because the President is not constrained by directions of the Cabinet orLegislature. Expertise and merit might take a backseat in case of such appointments Efficient administration without influence of political parties, as Presidency is notdependent on majority support from the legislature. Conflict between Executive and Legislature in case opposition dominates the latter. This can lead to hampering of publicinterest. Impeachment is a complex and time-consuming procedure which can be resorted to only in emergency situations. MERITS & DEMERITS OF PRESIDENTIAL FORM Forms of Government ➢ The form wherein executive is selected from among the members of the legislature and is responsible to the legislature is called Parliamentary government. ➢ A.k.a.Cabinet form of Government as the real executive power lies with the Cabinet. ➢ Executive is held accountable by Legislature. Due to this feature it is also called “Responsible Government”. ➢ India’s current Parliamentary form of governance is an inheritance from its colonial past. ➢ Parliamentary governments can either be constitutional monarchies (United Kingdom etc.) or ➢ parliamentaryrepublics (Italy, Germany, Irelandetc.) ➢ Parliamentarianism is the most common form of governance in Europe, in the Caribbean etc. and throughout the world, usually in former colonies of the British Empire. ➢ Westminster model of Parliamentary governance – a system incorporating three arms of government - the executive, the legislature and an independent judiciary – is found in most former colonies including India. WHAT IS PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF GOVERNMENT? Forms of Government ➢ Houses of Parliament: Parliamentary governments can be either bicameral (two houses of parliament) or unicameral; most parliamentary democracies follow bicameral legislature. ➢ Accountability of Executive:The executive – Prime Minister and ministers – emerge from Legislature (Parliament) and are therefore always answerable to the Legislative. ➢ Dual Executive:There is a nominal,or a titularexecutive, the President (or monarch etc.) – Head of State – and a real executive,the Prime Minister – Head of Government. ➢ The Prime Minster is the acknowledged head of the Parliamentary system. ➢ Oath of Secrecy:Whatever is discussed in the cabinet stays in the cabinet.Divulsion of information can cost a Cabinet Minster his/her seat. FEATURES OF PARLIAMENTARY FORM ➢ The Parliamentary system is dealt with under Article 74 and Article 75 when it comes to Centre. ➢ The State Parliamentary system is highlighted under the articles 163 and 164. ➢ In our Parliamentary system, the Prime Minister is the senior-most minister of cabinet of the executive. ➢ Members of Cabinet are selected by the PM and may be dismissed by him. ➢ Executive powers are exercised by Union Council of Minister while the Union Cabinet,a smaller body,is the supreme body of executive powers: According to Article 75,Union Cabinet members are the Prime Minister and ministers of the rank of cabinetminister. ➢ Chief differences from the British Parliamentary system which we emulated – ➢ Appointed Speaker formally resigns from previous party unlike India where party membership continues and yet the Speaker must remain unbiased. ➢ Absence of a‘shadow cabinet’to monitor and criticize the majority government,keep them in check. Forms of Government Merits Demerits Less delay in passing laws etc, as Executive comes from Legislative. Unclear separation of powers – Legislators forced to follow party whip especially in case of a large majority in theHouse. Circumvents authoritarianism by holding Executive accountable; powers are not concentrated in onemind. Unnecessary interference of Legislators in administrative matter causing inefficiency of both Executive and Legislative. Diversity of parties – educative value – public builds opinions based on different party manifestos. Vote Bank Politics as a result of competition between various parties results in a Government that tends to be ElectionCentric. Easy availability of an alternate government shows the flexibility of this system. Relying on majority party, experts in the field are not hired for inputs on executive duties. Ministers may be underqualified, making them dependent on civil servants hence creating a ‘bureaucratic government’. MERITS & DEMERITS OF PARLIAMENTARY FORM Forms of Government FEATURES Parliamentary Presidential Executive Dual Executive Single Executive Relationship b/w Executive and Legislative Executive is accountable to the Legislative as it comes from the latter. Both are independent and Executive is not accountable. Tenure Unfixed Fixed Dissolution Prime Minister may dissolve the LowerHouse before expiration of term. President cannotdissolve the Lower House. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: PRESIDENTIAL & PARLIAMENTARY FORMS Forms of Government ➢ By definition, a cabinet is a body of high-ranking State officials – like leaders of executive branch. ➢ Functions of Cabinet may vary between decision making bodies with collective responsibility and purely advisory bodies that are assistant to Head of State/Government. ➢ The term used for Cabinet differs across countries. The Cabinet is known by names such as \"Council of Ministers\", \"Government Council\" or \"Council of State\",or by lesser known names such as \"Federal Council\" etc. CABINET Forms of Government PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM PRESID ENTIAL SYSTEM Collectively decides the government's direction, usually in regard to legislations passed by the parliament. Official role of Cabinet is that of official advisory council to the head of Government – President receives advice andopinions. Monarch/Ceremonial Head of State virtually always acts on advice of Cabinet. President can depart from Cabinet’s advice as seen fit by him. On ground, the Cabinet reports to real Head of Government – usually the Prime Minister – rather than the titular Head of State. Cabinet works directly under and for the President who is both Head of Government and State. The Cabinet in a parliamentary system must not only be confirmed, but enjoy the continuing confidence of theParliament. Members of the Cabinet are chosen directly by President, they may or may not have to be confirmed by Legislation. Cabinet influences Legislative policy to a large extent. Members of Cabinet focus on and have massive influence in their own Executive departments. ROLE OF CABINET Forms of Government In conclusion, a Cabinet is found in almost all forms of Government, the two major ones – Presidential, Parliamentary – and other hybrid versions such as semi- Presidential system etc. The members are responsible for daily management of the Government, response to emergency situations and sudden events. They play an important role in any form of Governance and help to keep things running smoothly. Forms of Government THANK YOU","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
