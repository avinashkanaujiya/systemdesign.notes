WHAT IS ARTICLE 368? (Introduction) Structure followed ARTICLE 368 ▪ Evolution of Art 368 is correlated to the evolution of amenability of Fundamental Rights and the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles ▪ Evolved through a series of Constitutional Amendments and landmark SC judgements ultimately giving birth to the doctrine of Basic Structure which set the course for expansive Judicial Review and Activism as they were a part of the doctrine of Basic Structure Art 368 Relationship b/w FR and DPSP FR Amenability [13(2)] HOW HAS IT EVOLVED OVER TIME? Article 368 ARTICLE 368ARTICLE 368 ▪ Art 13(2) invalidates any law that attempts to violate any Fundamental Right while Art 368 empowers the Parliament to amend the Constitution ▪ To address the inequalities of land ownership, nation wide land reform acts were enacted in different states (land is a State Subject) to enforce upper limits of land holding in excess of which would be compulsorily purchased by the State. ▪ This was construed an attack on an erstwhile fundamental right to Property and other rights such as Equality and Expression by the landowners. This led to multiple petition filed across the country challenging respective state land reform laws. ▪ The Parliament enacted the 1st Constitution Amendment Act, 1951 within one year of the new constitution in force adding Schedule 11 which prohibited Judicial Review of any law placed under it. Several state laws were also added to Schedule 11. ▪ Most of the landmark judgements arose out of landowners seeking their land rights which were restricted by laws placed under constitutional protection from Judicial review. ▪ Land reforms can be said to be starting point of it all as most of the amenability of fundamental rights originated from there which in turn impacted Art. 368. INSIGHTS & CONTEXT ARTICLE 368 ▪ Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (5 judge Bench) (1951) : 1 CA, 1951 challenged, SC held that the Parliament enjoys absolute constituent power to amend the any part of the Constitution including fundamental rights as constitutional amendments were not considered ‘law’ as the restrictions under Art. 13(2). Constitutional scheme gave demarcation between ordinary law (exercise of legislative power) and constitutional law (exercise of constituent power) ▪ Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (5 judge Bench : unanimous) : 17 CA, 1964 challenged, Procedure to amend the Constitution was challenged, but similar outcome as that of Shankari Prasad’s case. However, doubts were raised on whether law includes constitutional amendment or not. ▪ Golak Nath v. State of Punjab (1967) : (11 judge bench. 6:5) 1, 4, 17 CA Challenged, In a complete reversal, the SC held that the Parliament does not have absolute power and no fundamental right can be amended. It also categorically said that constitutional amendments were to be considered ‘law’ as the restrictions under Art. 13(2). Would only be applicable to subsequent amendments (American Doctrine of prospective ruling) KEY MILESTONES ARTICLE 368• Kesavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala (1973) (13 Judge Bench) (7:6) : • Kesavananda Bharti is unique in the history of international constitutional law : – Anxious Political Circumstances – Shift in the balance of democratic power it caused – Unprecedented number of separate opinions delivered by the court – Sheer length of the judgement itself (800 pages, 420,000 words long) - 11 separate opinions were issued, thereby no actual clear indication, first time in history, judges gave a summary of their decision (4 judges refused to sign that summary) – The Basic Structure Doctrine is the pinnacle of Judicial Creativity • The government passed a series of constitutional amendments (24, 25, and 29th) trying to reverse Golak Nath’s judgement. • The largest ever bench of the SC in India history delivered a balancing act judgment by – • 24 CA 1971 : Nullified Golak Nath : CA not Law under Art.13 : Upheld as valid • 25 CA 1971 : 39(b) (c) > 14, 19, 31 : Upheld as valid • 29 CA 1971 : Added two land reforms statutes to the 9th Schedule : Upheld as valid • Overruled Golak Nath which said that FR could not be nullified or taken away by the Parliament • There was no implied limitation on Parliament’s Power to amend Art. 368, however • Declaring that the Parliament can amend anything in the Constitution as long as it does not violate the Doctrine of Basic Structure (Teleological Approach) • Doctrine of Basic Structure (Originally, a German Idea) would be a series of principles that would be identified by the SC from time to time • Additions made to the IXth schedule, and all CAs passed in the future, post the judgment would also be subject to judicial review • Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980) : • Textile Mill in Bangalore which was nationalized in 1970s, and the same was challenged by the owners in 1977 – 42 CA, 1976 challenged • 42 CA : – Added FD : Upheld – Made DPSPs superior to any other part of the Constitution : Only if JR is allowed (art 31C) – Added Secular, Socialist to the Preamble : Upheld – Amended Art 368 by nullifying Kesavananda Bharti : Overruled » No amendment, regardless of when it is enacted, would be question by a court » No limitation on the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution – Minerva is the last case in which the government made a concerted effort to establish parliamentary supremacy over the Constitution • Marks the beginning of judicial supremacy of sorts, with SC entrenched as the final arbitrator of constitutional interpretation in India • Arguably, as significant as Kesavananda Bharti Case Art 368’s current status: Parliament can amend anything in the Constitution if it does not violate Basic Structure. Implications of Art 368’s current status: ▪ 104 Constitutional Amendments in less than 75 years of becoming a nation and 70 years of enforcing the Constitution ▪ Expansive Judicial Review as it is a part of Basic Structure ▪ Striking down of 99 CA (NJAC) which would have fundamental altered Judicial Appointments in the country ▪ 103 CA (2019) on EWS reservation currently challenged (Youth For Equality v. Union of India) ▪ Art 370 Abrogation Challenged (Manohar Lal Sharma v. Union of India) ▪ Constitutionality of Art 35 A (We the Citizens v. Union of India) ARTICLE 368 Kesavananda and Emergency ➢ 1973 : 3 judges who gave an adverse judgement against the Govt, including the next senior most judge, one of whom were to become the next CJI, were superseded, Justice A.N. Ray who ruled in favor was appointed as CJI ➢ 1975 : Post Allahabad HC judgement on Indira Gandhi’s election in 1975, SC stayed the matter, and Emergency was imposed; 39 CA. 1975 was passed, and was challenged, the first time, a CA was challenged not on the grounds of property or social welfare but an electoral law. ➢ Basic Structure was applied : free and fair elections, rule of law ➢ 39 CA was struck down, but not retrospectively. ➢ 1975 : Justice A.N. Ray : Set up a 13 bench to review Kesavananda during the Emergency but was dissolved after 2 days. Little information is available as press was restricted during the Emergency. BASIC STRUCTURE DOCTRINE Critical Review : BASIC STRUCTURE DOCTRINE Positive Impacts: ➢ SC was the unmatched authority when it came to Constitutional Matters ➢ Firmly, established Judicial Review ➢ Judges wanted a win-win for Parliament and the SC ➢ Protected the Indian State as well as our South Asian Counterparts from totalitarian, military, or other extra constitutional interventions. Points of debate: ➢ No mention in the Constitution ➢ Lengthy ➢ Lack of consensus BASIC STRUCTURE DOCTRINE Analysis and Future of Basic Structure Doctrine : ➢ If one had to choose between the Legislature and the Judiciary, as the custodian of the Constitution, it would most likely be the latter ➢ Does violate traditional notions of Judicial Review ➢ Was a rescue operation by the Judiciary of the Indian Democracy ➢ Minimum 13 judges would be required to reconsider Kesavananda Bharti case ➢ By its very nature, Basic Structure Doctrine cannot be overruled by a legitimate exercise of power, the only other means would be through extra constitutional methods, both of which are very unlikely BASIC STRUCTURE DOCTRINE ▪ The foundation of Constitutionalism is the creation of State limited by the Constitution. ▪ It the Parliament is bestowed with unlimited powers to amend the Constitution; it would defeat the purpose of having a Constitution in the first place. ▪ Governments have been known to enact questionable constitutional amendments to suit ulterior motives especially during the Emergency Era (42 CA, 1976). ▪ Absolute power corrupts absolutely. ▪ However, the SC must also respect the democratic mandate duly attained by the Government and collective morality in the interest of the people must always prevail. IS THE EVOLUTION OF ART 368 JUSTIFIED? (Conclusion) ARTICLE 368 ▪ “Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic set up. If democracy means government of the people by the people, it is obvious that every citizen must be entitled to participate in the democratic process and in order to enable him to intelligently exercise his rights of making a choice, free & general discussion of public matters is absolutely essential.” – Justice Bhagwati in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978 ▪ Under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution, all citizens shall have the Fundamental Right: ▪ to freedom of speech and expression ▪ to assemble peaceably and without arms ▪ to form associations or unions ▪ to move freely throughout the territory of India ▪ to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India ▪ to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business ▪ This was expanded to include the right to receive and disseminate information in. ▪ International conventions including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, European convention on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also guarantee freedom of speech and expression and its protection. Introduction🡪 Significance🡪 Judgements🡪 Reasonable Restrictions on freedom of speech & expression (in light of current affairs) INTRODUCTION Structure followedARTICLE 19 Restrictions on freedom – reasonable or unreasonable 1.Sovereignty and integrity of the country. 2.Friendly relations with foreign countries. 3.Public order. 4.Security of the State. 5.Decency or morality. 6.Defamation. 7.Contempt of court. 8.Incitement to an Offence. ARTICLE 19 1. In a democracy, the freedom of speech and expression is one of the prime liberties granted to the citizens. It forms a foundation for other rights granted to citizens, such as the freedom of the press. Freedom of the press, in turn, helps in inculcating a better- informed public and electorate. 2. It ensures that citizens can express their opinions freely and also hold their political leaders accountable. Also, this freedom ensures that important information is legally shared and circulated among citizens. 3. It also provides a platform to make the marginalized and minority voices heard. Issues that concern these groups can be highlighted and brought to the forefront by using the right to freedom of speech and expression. 4. The freedom of speech and expression protects the creative license of artists and allows them to develop and share ideas freely. These can be academic writings, satirical work, theatre, cartoons, visual arts, and stand-up comedies SIGNIFICANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION ARTICLE 19 Facets of free speech • Freedom of press : – The freedom of speech and expression as under Article 19 also includes the freedom of the press. During the Constituent Assembly Debates, Damodar S. Seth argued that freedom of the press should be explicitly included in the Article due to the present age where the press holds immense value. However, it was decided that a separate provision for the same is not required. • Right to Silence – The citizens’ right to stay silent has also been considered a part of the right to freedom of speech and expression. In the case of Bijoe Emmanuel & Ors. v. the State of Kerala, the court upheld the petitioner’s right to stay silent during the national anthem. • Right to report and broadcast – Under the freedom of speech and expression, citizens possess the right to circulate and publish content. It also includes the right to broadcast information. They also have the right to report proceedings of a court of law, this also ensures transparency. • The right to be informed – A citizen’s right to know, receive, and impart information as a part of their right to information has also been recognized as a part of the freedom of speech and expression. In the judgment of the Union of India v. the Association of Democratic Reforms, the court held that the voters’ have the right to know about candidates. ARTICLE 19 ➢ In Romesh Thappar v State of Madras, 1950 the Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes freedom to propagate ideas which is ensured by freedom of circulation of a publication. Moreover, freedom of speech and of Press was declared to be the foundation of all democratic organisations. ➢ In Sakal Papers v. Union of India (1962) Article 19(1)(a) affords protection to the freedom of speech and expression, and not effective or meaningful exercise of the freedom of speech and expression ➢ The cases of Bennet and Coleman & Co. v. Union of India, 1973 and Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) P. Ltd v. Union of India, 1986 extended freedom of expression to corporations and the SC declared that limitations on the right outside the purview of Article 19(2) are not valid. ➢ In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978 the SC ruled that freedom of speech and expression was not limited by geographical limitations or boundaries and claimed that Article 19(1)(a) encompasses both the right to speak and the freedom to express in India and also abroad. IMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS: Landmark ARTICLE 19 IMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS : Contemporary ➢ In People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of India, 1997 the SC declared that telephone tapping, violates Article 19(1)(a) unless it comes within the grounds of reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). ➢ The Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Assn. for Democratic Reforms, 2002 observed that one-sided facts, disinformation, misinformation, and non-information all lead to democracy is a farce.” ➢ The Supreme Court introduced a new dimension to freedom of speech and expression in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra & Anr. v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, 2013 (197) DLT 413: That our written Constitution guarantees not only freedom of speech but also freedom after speech ➢ Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, the Supreme Court struck down Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 on the ground that it gave unfettered discretion to the executive, in the absence of an elaborate definition of the words used in the provision, to initiate criminal prosecution against any person who caused annoyance in an indecent manner, a vague offense ➢ In Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India and Ors, 2020 the SC ruled that freedom to access the Internet is a fundamental right and is protected under Article 19(1)(a) ARTICLE 19 ▪ The Right to Protest is enshrined in the constitution – Article 19(1)(b) assures citizens the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. ▪ Public order as a reasonable restriction under Article 19(2) was added by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. Public order implies absence of violence and an orderly state of affairs in which citizens can peacefully pursue their normal avocation of life. It also includes public safety. However, criticism of the government does not necessarily disturb public order. ▪ A broader interpretation of Article 19 includes the right to freely express opinion on the conduct of the government. The right to association becomes the right to associate for political purposes. The right to peaceably assemble also allows political parties and citizenship bodies such as university-based student groups to question and object to acts of the government by demonstrations, agitations and public meetings, to launch sustained protest movements. ▪ Important Judgment: In Ramlila Maidan Incident v. Home Secretary, Union of India & Ors., 2012, the SC stated, “Citizens have a fundamental right to assembly and peaceful protest which cannot be taken away by an arbitrary executive or legislative action.” RIGHT TO PROTEST ARTICLE 19 SEDITION vs. RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND EXPRESSION ARTICLE 19 ➢ Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code penalizes anyone who by words, either spoken or written or by visible representation or by otherwise attempts to bring disaffection, hatred, or contempt against the government established by law. ➢ The colonial-era law of sedition has been widely criticized for serving as a restriction on free speech and expression. ➢ Even though the explanations to the section make it clear that only attempts to excite hatred, contempt, or disaffection lead to sedition and lawful criticism with a view of obtaining change does not amount to sedition, the law has been widely abused. ➢ For an act to amount to sedition, there must be an intention to cause public disorder or disturbance and hinder public peace. Sedition vs. right to free speech and expression ARTICLE 19 • The Supreme Court in the case of Kedarnath Singh v. State of Bihar put a limit on the scope of Section 124A, whereby only the individuals using free speech and expression to incite violence and disrupt the law can be penalized. • In the case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, the court emphasized that there has to be a degree of proximity between the words spoken or expressed and the public disorder that takes place. • In reality, there has been a continued trend where charges of sedition have been pressed against individuals for criticizing the government. Due to this abuse of the law, demands have been made to abolish the Section to protect the sanctity of free speech and expression. • Recently in a petition against the sedition case filed against the Senior journalist, Vinod Dua, Vinod Dua v. Union of India, the Supreme Court upheld his journalistic freedom and said that every journalist is entitled to protection and the sedition law has to be applied as provided in the Kedarnath judgment. A BJP leader in Himachal Pradesh had filed an FIR against Vinod Dua for criticising the Prime Minister and the Union government on his Youtube channel. The court quashed the FIR. ARTICLE 19 Hate Speech vs. right to free speech and expression • In contemporary times, it is often used as a tool to gain popularity. It manifests itself into a form that creates divisions in society by attempting to belittle specific groups of people based on their religion, culture, ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, language, occupation, ideology, appearance, etc. • It runs contrary to the objective of the fundamental right to free speech and expression that is to liberate people from all strata of society. • Hate speech often relies on and perpetuates stereotypes. Hate speech has been seen to be used post-elections to cause anti-minority incitement and is often related to the politics of violence and hatred. ARTICLE 19 • The Constitution of India by law seeks to prevent the delivery of hate speech under the garb of free speech and expression. It prohibits expressions that can be insulting to others. • According to Article 51A (h) of the Indian Constitution, citizens must develop scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform. Various criminal laws in India also penalize hate speech. • In the case of Dr Das Rao Deshmukh v. Kamal Kishore Nanasaheb Kadam, the appellant sought votes by using a poster that said: “teach a lesson to Muslims”. The Supreme Court held that the poster cannot be justified as it threatens to arouse communal feelings and create disharmony between the communities. It was offensive and went against the secular structure of the country. ARTICLE 19 ▪ Restriction on the freedom of speech and expression can be imposed if it exceeds the reasonable and fair limit and amounts to contempt of court. ▪ The first Indian statute on the law of contempt, i.e., the Contempt of Courts Act was passed in 1926. It was later replaced by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. The 1952 Act was subsequently replaced by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. ▪ According to the 1971 Act, Contempt of court may be either ‘civil or ‘criminal.’ Civil contempt is 'wilful disobedience to any judgment/ decree/ direction/ order/ writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.’ Criminal contempt includes the publication (in any form) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which scandalises the court or lowers its authority, or prejudices or interferes with courts proceedings or administration of justice in any manner. ▪ Indian contempt law was amended in 2006 to make “truth” a defence. The qualification however is that such defence should not cover-up to escape from the consequences of a deliberate effort to scandalise the court. ▪ However, even after such amendment, a person can be punished for the statement unless they were made in public interest. ▪ In Het Ram Beniwal v. Raghuveer Singh, 2017 judgment the SC held that the power of contempt has to be exercised sparingly and in cases when there is a calculated effort to undermine the judiciary, and not in a routine manner. CONTEMPT OF COURT ARTICLE 19 ▪ Unfeasibility of content verification has led to growing vulnerability of the unfettered flow of speech to the peddling of unverified (and false/fake) information. ▪ Fake news or disinformation in India usually takes three forms: ▪ Targeting a minority and spreading false news implicating them in violent activities. ▪ Targeting particular individuals and spreading false news to tarnish their credibility and reputation. ▪ Spreading fake news about public personalities and their supposed heroics that increases their standing and influences political outcomes. ▪ Another form of fake news is malicious fake news designed to spread paranoia and mistrust among people. ▪ Reasons for prevalence: ▪ It is increasingly used as a political tool by parties to influence and polarise opinion. ▪ Proliferation of technology, cheaper devices and affordable access to internet has reduced the cost of spreading fake news. ▪ Increased use of private encrypted messaging apps and social media platforms whose business models thrive on “viral content” and number of views. ▪ Judgment: In Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India, 2020 the SC recognized the problem of infodemics in India and passed an order asking the state governments to comply with the directions issued by the Centre to curb the menace of fake news. FAKE NEWS/DISINFORMATION ARTICLE 19 ▪ Conflation of Free Speech and Curbing Fake News in Legislation: ▪ Information Technology Act, 2008 (IT Act) – Contrary to 2011 rules under the Act which provided immunity to social media platforms as ‘intermediaries’ for inception, transmission and reception of fake content through their networks, they are now directed to proactively censor content by the government. This is detrimental to free speech. ▪ Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) – Section 54 of the DMA purports to deal with ‘false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic’. The offence is punishable with imprisonment up to 1 year and the imposition of a fine. The provision is limited to the period of the disaster. ▪ Indian Penal Code (IPC) – Section 505(1)(b) deals with the spreading of false and mischievous content that results in fear or alarm to public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or public tranquility. Its application to fake news is however dubious as the latter is disguised as real news and more importantly, its source is often difficult to trace. ▪ Recommendation: the government must consistently invest in increasing voter awareness, voter literacy, a robust fact-checking environment and critical thinking among the masses. Social media platforms — through which fake news spreads so rapidly — on their part, should take up efforts to identify and combat such news. ARTICLE 19 Censorship of Cinema – Proposed amendments in the Cinematograph Bill, 2021 » the proposed amendments to the Cinematograph Act come two months after the dissolution of the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) in April 2021 under the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance by the union » the MIB proposes to grant “revisionary powers” to the union government whereby “on receipt of any reference,” the latter can direct the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to re-examine a film that has already been approved for public exhibition. » a film duly passed by the CBFC can be re-censored at the will of the union government. » Recalling a film already released in the theatres would adversely affect producers who work with huge marketing and publicity budgets and are largely dependent on theatrical releases for revenue generation. » Bringing in a law that makes producers’ position financially precarious would inevitably encourage a practice of self- censorship in the film industry. » the amendment would effectively override the sovereignty of an autonomous body like the CBFC, and undermine the authority of its advisory committee members, who ironically are appointed by the union government in the first place » K M Shankarappa v Union of India case in 2000 : Categorically states that once a film has been certified in compliance with the Cinematograph Act, there should not be any further interference, for that would amount to a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers where the executive cannot override the decision of the judiciary. » Must also provide a clarification as to who would be authorised to send a “reference” to the government for recertification » A lack of clarity could encourage certain vigilante groups to take advantage of the provision and use it as a way of threatening film-makers for allegedly hurting “religious sentiments.” ARTICLE 19 New IT Rules, 2021 • The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 • Designed to further empower the state and allow the executive considerable powers to shape public discourses. • The state now demands access to all information about the content and origins of every digital communication, a measure that will weaken the right to privacy • On the other hand, digital content is now subject to both self-regulation as well as extensive surveillance and regulation designed to allow substantial control by the executive over content ARTICLE 19 New IT Rules, 2021 • Debates around the IT Act – How, for instance, should we negotiate the desire to curb hate speech and to simultaneously ensure freedom of expression? – How can we build governance systems which are just, equitable, transparent, and do not leave ordinary citizens at the mercy of both technology as well as the formidable powers of the state? – How do we protect the ordinary citizen from surveillance, even as we recognise that our lives in the contemporary world are increasingly lived in the digital domain where we are constantly generating and leaving data footprints in nebulous spaces? – Does the only solution to curbing the immense power of multinational tech companies lie in strengthening the powers of the state? • These questions, legitimate as they are, have animated debates and discussions not just in India but all over the world. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 announced recently have yet again opened up some of these debates. ARTICLE 19 • Companies like Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Koo, Sharechat, and LinkedIn have shared details with MeitY as per the requirement of the new norms. Twitter sought an extension of the compliance window and called for a constructive dialogue and a collaborative approach from the government to safeguard freedom of expression of the public. • WhatsApp also filed a case in the Delhi High Court against the government on grounds that the new rules violated customer privacy. • The new Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code have also been challenged by entities like The Wire, LiveLaw and The Quint. ARTICLE 19 Features of these Rules: • The IT Rules 2021 aim to empower ordinary users of social media platforms and OTT platforms with a mechanism for redressal and timely resolution of their grievance with the help of a Grievance Redressal Officer (GRO) who should be a resident in India. Special emphasis has been given on the protection of women and children from sexual offences, fake news and other misuse of the social media • Identification of the “first originator of the information” would be required in case of an offence related to sovereignty and integrity of India. A Chief Compliance Officer, a resident of India, also needs to be appointed and that person shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and Rules. A monthly compliance report mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken on the complaints would be necessary. • The OTT platforms, online news and digital media entities, on the other hand, would need to follow a Code of Ethics. OTT platforms would be called as ‘publishers of online curated content’ under the new rules. They would have to self-classify the content into five categories based on age and use parental locks for age above 13 or higher. They also need to include age verification mechanisms for content classified as ‘Adult’. • Three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been mandated. This includes the appointment of a GRO, self-regulatory bodies registered with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB) to look after the Code of Ethics and a Charter for the self-regulating bodies formulated by MIB. ARTICLE 19 Misuse of Social Media • WhatsApp currently has a user base of 340 million in the country, accounting for the largest number of subscribers in the world • Facebook has 290 million, Twitter 17 million, YouTube 265 million and Instagram, 120 million user base. • With such a huge population dependent on social media platforms, the tech-giants cannot choose to ignore the new and emerging challenges like persistent spread of fake news, rampant abuse of the platforms to share morphed images of women, deep fakes and other contents that threaten the dignity of women and pose a threat to security. • Instances of use of abusive language, defamatory contents and hate speech in these platforms have become very common. The algorithms used by these platforms to optimize views and advertisements often fail to distinguish between relevant or useful content and abusive content and fake news, thereby amplifying them in very little or no time. • The Supreme Court in 2018, in the Tehseen S. Poonawalla v/s Union of India case, directed the government to curb and stop dissemination of explosive messages and videos on various social media platforms which have a tendency to incite mob violence and lynching of any kind ARTICLE 19 Technological Hurdles with Respect to Traceability • Social media companies like WhatsApp have expressed apprehensions about the provisions in the new rules which require them to identify traceability when required to do so by authorities. They contend that this could possibly lead to the breaking the of end-to-end encryption, which in turn can compromise users’ privacy • The government, on the other hand, has stated that traceability would only be required in case of “very serious offences” that threaten the sovereignty and integrity of India. Further, it could also be implemented without breaking the end-to-end encryption. The onus, however, will lie on the companies to find a technological solution for the same. • Supplying metadata like phone number of the sender, the time of sending a message, the device it was sent from and its location, could also trace the origin of a message. Interestingly, WhatsApp’s new privacy policy itself has a provision of sharing metadata of its users with its parent company, Facebook, for personalised ads • As per latest reports, the Union government has sent a notice to WhatsApp for withdrawal of its new privacy policy which has caused a lot of controversy since its inception ARTICLE 19 The Free Speech Debate • The social media giant, Twitter, has raised concerns regarding free speech over the new IT guidelines. It stated that it would strive to comply with the law but if guided by principles of transparency and freedom of expression under the rule of law. • Failure to comply with the rules could lead to the removal of ‘intermediary’ status (a safe harbour to avoid liability for the content that their users publish) of the companies and could possibly invite sanction or even punishment under the law. ARTICLE 19 Right to internet • The right to internet access & the right to speak and express oneself over the internet, which are the positive negative and forms respectively • Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India : a negative right to the internet subject to restrictions under Articles 19(2) and 19(6) has been recognized. • K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India : Any restriction to the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business over the medium of internet, if imposed by the state, under Article 19 have to pass muster of the proportionality test which as enumerated. – A law interfering with fundamental rights must be in pursuance of a legitimate State aim; – The justification for rights infringing measures that interfere with or limit the exercise of fundamental rights and liberties must be based on the existence of a rational connection between those measures, the situation in fact and the object sought to be achieved; – The measures must be necessary to achieve the object and must not infringe rights to an extent greater than is necessary to fulfil the aim; – Restrictions must not only serve legitimate purposes; they must also be necessary to protect them; and – The State must provide sufficient procedural safeguards. ARTICLE 19 Right to internet under Article 21 • In its recent judgment in Faheema Shirin v. State of Kerala (2019), the High court has recognized that mobile phones and internet access through it are part and parcel of the day to day life • Resolutions adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the General Assembly which unequivocally point to the fact that how internet access plays a key role in accessing information and its close link to education and knowledge. • Technology, is an enabler of rights and not a right in and of itself. – The meaningful exercise of the right to freedom of speech and expression over the medium of internet is dependent, invariably and inextricably, upon the access to the available infrastructure. – Infrastructure in turn depends upon social and economic factors such as the distribution of resources; the policies of the State and its intervention in the nature of regulation of resources. ARTICLE 19 The Way Forward • Freedom of speech and expression is the basic tenet of any democracy. However, no freedom is absolute or completely unrestricted. • The imperative of striking the right balance between fundamental rights and ascertaining the reasonableness of a restriction has been a constant effort since the adoption of the Constitution. The debate has now reached the digital world. The on-going tussle between private, tech giants who own a substantial amount of Big Data, governments desirous of imposing reasonable restrictions and users worried about issues relating to data privacy and constraints on freedom of speech and expression, is likely to get more complicated before optimum solutions can be arrived at. • The IT Rules 2021 seek to address concerns of the citizens without infringing on their privacy and personal liberties, while maintaining digital sovereignty at the same time. ARTICLE 19 Introduction🡪 Significance🡪 Recent developments that have thrown light on Article 21 Article 21 reads as : “ No person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law.” The right has been held to be the heart of the Constitution, the most organize & progressive provision of our constitution, the foundation of our laws. INTRODUCTION Structure followed ARTICLE 21 ▪ Sexuality refers to choice and preference of sexual partners and personal sexual expression. It is not limited to one specific action, and can be expressed in outward non-sexual forms, for example, through clothing and Style. ▪ Gender on the other hand, is a social construction and refers to the conditioned understanding of how different genders (gendered roles are mostly restricted to masculinity and femininity) play specific normative roles. LGBTQIA+ ARTICLE 21 ▪ Gay and Lesbian – most basic classification on the basis of same sex-attraction; gay for men, lesbian for women. ▪ Bisexual & Pansexual – someone who is attracted to people of their gender or other gender identities is bisexual. It is considered restrictive since only the twin sexualities of men and women are included. Instead, the term pansexual is used to denote someone who is attracted to people of all gender identities. ▪ Asexual – someone who experiences little to no sexual attraction ▪ Intersex – individuals born with a combination of biological sex characteristics (including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals) which do not fit the typical definition of male and female bodies. ▪ Transgender – someone whose gender identity or expression is different from that of their biological sex. Someone born as a man (with male genitalia) who self-identifies as a woman, or vice versa is a transgender person. ▪ Non-Binary – someone who experiences a gender identity that is neither exclusively male nor female or is in between, or beyond both genders. They can be gender fluid (shifting between male and female), agender (without gender), third gender, or something else entirely. ARTICLE 21 ▪ Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in December 2000 when the Dutch parliament passed a landmark bill allowing same-sex couples to marry, divorce, and adopt children. ▪ Mexico allows same-sex marriages in some jurisdictions – Mexico City, Quintana Roo, and Coahuila. ▪ Going against its earlier position, the United States State Department under the Trump administration has worked closely with anti-L.G.B.T.Q. organizations and has systematically opposed the use of words like “gender” in United Nations resolutions. ▪ Same-sex relations are illegal in much of South and Central Asia, including in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Nepal has enacted some protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2015 a government-appointed panel recommended that lawmakers legalize same-sex marriage. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan allow people to register as a third gender in official documents. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON LGBTQIA+ ARTICLE 21 Historical Context ▪ Kinnar, or hijra as the third gender in India have been acknowledged and accepted by the society. Their presence is noted in ancient texts of Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Kama Sutra. They often held important political positions in court, as well as part of the entourage of kings and queens during the Mughal period, ▪ India also had a more open attitude to homosexuality before the Raj and there is ample evidence of it in medieval history, mythology and architecture. ▪ Criminalization of homosexuality, as well as the degeneration of the social position of kinnars can be traced to the British imperial rule. Modelled on the Buggery Act of 1533, Section 377 of the IPC was introduced in India in 1861, which made sexual activities \"against the order of nature\" illegal. ▪ As per section 377 it was a punishable act to have intercourse with any man, woman or animals against the order of nature – homosexuality and bisexuality were both outlawed. LGBTQIA+ IN INDIA ARTICLE 21 Current Indian Law ▪ The Preamble to the Indian Constitution mandates justice -- social, economic, and political equality of status – for all. ▪ The right of equality before law and equal protection under the law is guaranteed in Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. ▪ NALSA vs UoI (2014): Transgenders recognised as third gender. ▪ In August 2017, the SC held Privacy as a fundamental right. It also observed that “sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy.” ▪ The 2018 five-judge bench SC Judgment scrapped Section 377 of IPC in a historic unanimous verdict. It recognized sexual orientation as a natural and inherent biological phenomenon and decriminalized adult consensual same-sex relationships. ▪ Parliament passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 ▪ The government published the Draft Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 LEGISLATION AND AFFIRMATION ACTION ARTICLE 21 ▪ Definition of transgender – The Bill defines a transgender person as one whose gender does not match the gender assigned at birth. It includes transmen and trans-women, persons with intersex variations, gender-queers, and persons with socio-cultural identities, such as kinnar and hijra. ▪ The Act prohibits discrimination against a transgender person in relation to: ▪ Education ▪ Employment ▪ Healthcare ▪ access to, or enjoyment of goods, facilities, opportunities available to the public; ▪ right to movement ▪ right to reside, rent, or otherwise occupy property ▪ opportunity to hold public or private office ▪ access to a government or private establishment ▪ The Act contains special imperatives on behalf of the government to ensure proper health care facilities, employment and education opportunities for transgenders, and their right to reside and be included in their households. ▪ The Act states that the relevant government will take measures to ensure the full inclusion and participation of transgender persons in society. It must also take steps for their rescue and rehabilitation, vocational training and self-employment, create schemes that are transgender sensitive, and promote their participation in cultural activities. ▪ It calls for the creation of a National Council for Transgender persons (NCT) to advise the central government as well as monitor the impact of policies, legislation and projects with respect to transgender persons. KEY FEATURES OF TRANSGENDERS ACT, 2019 ARTICLE 21 ▪ The process by which a transgender certificate may be obtained is dubious and cumbersome. It also gives ultimate authority of issuing certification to the District Magistrate, without any specific guidelines. It does not recognize the right to self-identify one’s gender. ▪ It does not explicitly define what constitutes discrimination in the context of the transgender community. It also fails to specify punishment for those who discriminate against transgender persons. ▪ There is no mention of reservation in education and employment for the transgender community. ▪ It does not provide any means to improve the conditions related to begging. ▪ It does not mention any punishments for rape or sexual assault of transgender persons. ISSUES WITH TRANSGENDERS ACT DRAFT RULES, 2020 ▪ The centre released Draft Rules for Transgenders which specify the process of application and the manner of issuing identity certificate will be issued to them. ▪ Some key issues in the rules are problematic: ▪ The role of a clinical psychologist in the process of certification ▪ The mandatory 1 year residence period before application for certification ▪ Purpose for collection and sharing of certain data not specified ▪ Absence of specific welfare measures ARTICLE 21 ▪ The Transgenders Act, 2019 must be amended to make it more rational, inclusive and effective. ▪ Need for a multi pronged approach to deal with issue of prejudice and discrimination prevalent in society against them. Social sensitization forms the basis of an overhaul in perception of LGBTQIA+ persons. ▪ Initiatives like transgender bands, transgender police officers, and others should be encouraged as they can help in changing the approach of people /society. Increased visibility in the mainstream will also result in normalization of relations and higher acceptance. ▪ Need of sensitization of government bodies, especially related to Health, and Law and Order and increase awareness about the changed position of law among the masses. ▪ Need for a detailed anti-discrimination law that empowers the community. ▪ Indian Parliament should conduct a wide-ranging review of existing legal frameworks, repeal discriminatory laws, and address other gaps in the law that prevent LGBT persons from fully exercising their rights. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER TRANSGENDER RIGHTS ARTICLE 21 ▪ While there is no universally accepted and legal definition of privacy, it broadly relates to the diverse modes by which people, personal information, certain personal property, and personal decision-making can be made less accessible to others. ▪ It is a Human and Natural Right enjoyed by every human being by virtue of their existence. ▪ It is a Fundamental Right emerging from guarantee of life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. ▪ The Right to Privacy is determined on a case-to-case basis due to the dynamic meaning of privacy. PRIVACY ARTICLE 21ARTICLE 21 ▪ Article 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2012, recognizes the respect for private and family life, home and communications. Article 8 mandates protection of personal data and its collection for a specified legitimate purpose. ▪ Around 80 countries in the world have enacted laws regarding privacy including Australia, Canada, UK, and South Africa. While there is no separate law and the term privacy is not mentioned in the United States constitution, right to privacy is seen as a part of Fourth Amendment rights. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON PRIVACY ▪ In MP Sharma v. Satish Chandra, 1954 the SC questioned and disagreed to the existence of a constitutionally protected right to privacy. ▪ In Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1962 while the SC invalidated a Police Regulation for nightly domiciliary visits on the grounds that it constituted “unauthorised intrusion into a person’s home and a violation of ordered liberty”, it held that the right to privacy was not guaranteed under Article 21. ▪ Supreme court judgments in 1975 (Gobind v. State of M.P) and 1978 (Smt. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India) held that right to privacy should be denied only on account of superior reasons which allow for infringement of such a right, and that the law and procedure authorising interference with right of privacy must also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive respectively. The 1975 judgment also held that right to privacy should go through the process of case-by-case development. EVOLUTION OF PRIVACY AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT ARTICLE 21 ▪ The court held in the R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra case, 1972 that telephonic conversations are private in nature which make phone tapping a violation of privacy. ▪ The Harvinder Kaur v. Harmander Singh, 1983 judgment extended right to privacy to gender priority wherein private life is protected from public portrayal. ▪ The Right to Privacy Bill, 2011. ▪ Justice AP Shah Committee on Privacy – 2012 ▪ In the landmark judgment in case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, 2017 the SC declared Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21. The court held that privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. ARTICLE 21 ▪ Information Technology Act, 2000 ▪ The IT Act provides for safeguard against certain breaches in relation to data from computer systems. It contains provisions to prevent the unauthorized use of computers, computer systems and data stored therein. ▪ The Act provides for payment of compensation (in civil cases) and punishment (criminal cases) in case of wrongful disclosure and misuse of personal data and violation of contractual terms in respect of personal data. ▪ Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 ▪ The Rules deal with protection of \"Sensitive personal data or information of a person\", including information relating to: passwords; financial information such as bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details; physical, physiological and mental health condition; sexual orientation; medical records and history; and biometric information. ▪ It provides for rules and guidelines to be followed by corporate bodies while dealing with personal sensitive data or information of people, disclosure of which is punishable under section 72A of the IT Act. GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN PRIVACY ARTICLE 21 Justice B N Srikrishna Committee Report, 2018 ▪ The committee was formed in August 2017, after the 2017 SC Judgment. ▪ The report on A Free and Fair Digital Economy highlighted that the relationship between service provider and the individual must be viewed as a fiduciary relationship, which implies obligation on part of service provider to deal fairly with personal data and use it only for authorised purposed. ▪ Its recommendations include creation of Data Protection Authority; restrictions on processing and collection of data; right to be forgotten; data localization, explicit consent requirements for sensitive personal data, etc. ▪ The committee recommended amendment of related laws including Information Technology Act, 2000, the Census Act, 1948, and the Aadhaar Act, 2016 to bolster their data protection framework. ARTICLE 21 The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 ▪ After deliberations, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 was approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, and tabled as The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 in Lok Sabha. It was referred to the Standing Committee, and is currently pending in the Lok Sabha. ▪ The Bill provides a framework for safeguarding the privacy of personal data of individuals (data principals) which is processed by entities (data fiduciaries). Data processing requires express consent of the data principal except in cases of medical emergency or when the State provides benefits or services. ▪ The Bill allows exemptions from many of its provisions when the data is processed in the interest of national security, or for prevention, investigation or prosecution of offences. ▪ Issues with the Bill: ▪ The provision exempting processing of personal data from most provisions of the Bill for prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of an offence is too broad. ▪ Mandatory local storage of data may lead to extra costs for the fiduciaries. ▪ Fiduciaries are required to inform the Data Protection Authority of data breach in cases where the data principal may be affected. The fiduciaries may not do so to protect their reputation. ▪ Important concerns about internet privacy arise due to social media companies being required to identify their users with the prescribed aim of combating fake news. This will lead to massive scale of data transfer to private entities, which violates user privacy and anonymity, thus defeating the original purpose of data protection. ARTICLE 21 The Right To Be Forgotten ➢ The right to be forgotten refers to the power or competence of individuals to limit, de-link, delete, or correct the disclosure of personal information on the internet that is misleading, embarrassing, irrelevant, or anachronistic. ➢ In common parlance, the right to be forgotten provides a data principal (as defined in Personal Data Protection Bill 2019) with the right against the disclosure of an individual's data when the processing of such personal data has become unlawful or futile ➢ The Indian Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 (\"PDPB\") provides for rights of correction and erasure of personal data wherein the data fiduciary receives a request from a data principal to correct, update or erase personal data. ➢ K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India : Identified the right to be forgotten as an inherent aspect of privacy, stating removing unnecessary, irrelevant or incorrect information from the internet if there is 'no legitimate interest' in such data ➢ The right encompasses certain rights of correction and erasure namely the right to ➢ (i) correct inaccurate or misleading personal data, ➢ (ii) to complete any incomplete personal data, ➢ (iii) update personal data that is out-of-date, and ➢ (iv) erase personal data which is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed.
