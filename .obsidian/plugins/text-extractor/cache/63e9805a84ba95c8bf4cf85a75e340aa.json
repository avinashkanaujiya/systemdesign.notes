(Batch:PCB9-RAFTAAR) Mrunal’s Economy Pillar#2A1: Budget → Revenue Part → Direct Tax-Receipts → Page 258 ⇒ So, to avoid such crisis, government will put a motion for vote on account. ⇒ Here, parliament (= practically Lok Sabha) will allow the govt to spend some money from the CFI, till the (next) Appropriation Act for next financial year is passed. ⇒ Vote on Account is generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the total budget estimation. ✋Vote on Account is no longer necessary because (अब इसक� ज�रत नहीं) ⇒ Constitution has no compulsion to put budget on a specific date.

So they did not require vote on account in 2017, 2018. ⇒ (###) However, in 2019’s Interim Budget, Modi Govt demanded “vote on account” because they planned to place full-budget after general elections and perhaps they wanted to keep the ‘option’ open for tabling a big-sized appropriation bill after winning the election.
