ARTICLE 328 Provides power to Legislature of a State to make provision with respect to elections to Legislature. ARTICLE 329 Provides to create a bar on the court to make any interference by courts relating to electoral matters. ELECTIONS ▪ Money and Muscle Power ▪ Campaigning, publicity, general party expenses in almost every constituency exceed permissible limit of expenses. Expenditure which is accounted for and legitimate is a small percentage of actualcosts. ▪ High electioneering costs leads to corruption. ▪ Reports of violence, booth capturing, threatening, intimidation and other illegal means are common nationwide practices during elections. ▪ Illegal means of coercion such as giving out ‘freebies’, food supplies at cheapest rates, electronic devices, etc.to voters in return for their vote. ▪ Paid misinformation via news giving out fake reports on opposing parties in order to deceive voters destroy the concept of ‘free and fair’elections. ▪ Vote buying displaces able politicians from posts of MP/MLA, and gives it to rich candidates instead ▪ Floating of non-serious candidates by parties to cut down rival candidate’s votes. ▪ Caste/communal practices, such as providing incentives to certain caste/religious groups in return for their votes,or candidate winning over people on grounds of having same caste/religion etc., defeats the whole purpose of democracy and equality. ▪ Misuse of Government machinery by party currently in power during elections leading to misuse of public funds as well as unfair advantage on electoral playground. ▪ P OI – Out of 533 candidates elected to the 17th Lok Sabha (2019-present), 475 Parliamentarians (accounting for 88%) are ‘crore-patis’ (multimillionaires) implying‘Rich Parliamentarians,Poor Indians’.

ELECTIONSRoPA WHY WAS RoPA, 1950 ENACTED? • A. 171 of the Constitution lays down the maximum and minimum number of seats in a Legislative Council. The actual number filled by the method established has been left to be provided by law. • Hence, this act of 1950 was brought in. • The Act also sought to confer on the President, the powers to delimit, after consultation with the ECI, the various constituencies. • Limitations: It merely provided for allocation of seats and power to delimit. It did not contain all provisions related to elections. RoPA, 1951 This law was enacted to provide for the provisions that were lacking in the previous one. Broadly speaking, it contains: • Qualifications and disqualification for membership of Parliament and State Legislature • Notification of general elections • Administrative machinery for the conduct of elections • Registration of political parties • Conduct of elections • Disputes regarding elections • Corrupt practices and electoral officers Grounds of disqualification: • Section 8- if a person has been charged with any criminal charges or has been convicted for the same, earlier • Section 123- offense of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. Loophole, showing inadequacy: • Lily Thomas case- Any MP, MLA, MLC who is sentenced for a crime and granted at least two years of imprisonment, loses membership of the House (Example- Election of CM of Sikkim) • Lalu Prasad Yadav was not debarred until he was convicted. Reforms/ Suggestions: • The ECI suggested amending the RPA to include paid news and declare it a criminal offence. • Revising the list of corrupt practices, and taking prompt actions accordingly fast-tracked by means of setting up of special courts • Amending IPC and the RP Act • These would not let those who make the law break it.

CURRENT AFFAIRS CONTEXT Process of Constitutionalization of a Commission: When something is constitutionalised, it is made subject to the provisions of a country’s constitution. Some commission can make a decision to approach the government for granting it constitutional status. Usually, the demand, at large, is raised to constitutionalise a particular commission, and subsequently, parliament passes a bill to provide constitutional status to the commission. Article 368 provides for the power of parliament to amend the constitution. Parliament can amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of the constitution in accordance with the procedures. An amendment is initiated only by the introduction of a bill for the purpose in either House of parliament, and when the bill is passed in each House by a prescribed majority, subject to President’s assent, the constitution stands amended in accordance with the terms of the bill. Article 338 was amended and a new Article 338A was inserted in the constitution through the Constitution (89th Amendment) Act, 2003 to establish the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST). BODIES Arguments against Constitutionalization Arguments for Constitutionalization Way forward • NCST, NCSC lack effectiveness as they are mere advisory bodies • Lack of implementation of recommendations • Lacks the independence as appointments are made by executives dominantly • Mandatory discussion of reports • Powers of civil courts • Can directly interact with media without hinderances • Better implementation of A. 14, 15, 15(3), 16, 39(a), 39(b), 39(c) and 42 • Threats to vulnerable groups in the physical and virtual world need to be recognized • Need for legislative and social changes • Raising awareness & compliance with the law BODIES ▪ The global surge in independent regulatory agencies is a relatively recent phenomenon in much of the developing world, including India. Originating in the United States (US), the concept of independent regulation spread to the European Union (EU), and to the developing countries in the 1990s ▪ Independent regulators are defined as “a body with its own powers and responsibilities given under public law, which is organisationally separate from ministries and is neither directly elected nor managed by elected officials.” ▪ While regulators have independence in performing their role, they still fall within the broad definition of the executive branch of the state, and are accountable to the legislature. ▪ Given this, the question arises as to how the performance of regulators is monitored to ensure that the public interest is properly served. To simultaneously ensure regulatory independence and implementation of regulations consistent with government policies, legislative oversight of regulators is necessary. INTRODUCTION ▪ India’s economic liberalisation in the 1990s opened the economy allowing the private sector to operate in areas which were earlier government monopolies. ▪ The shift in the approach necessitated the regulation of sectors where private operators were permitted. ▪ Following the broad model adopted by several countries, India established independent regulators to guarantee a level playing field for public and private agencies and to ensure their independence from governmentdepartments. ▪ It established independent regulators through statutes in a variety of sectors such as electricity, telecommunications, insurance, securities market, and oil and gas. ▪ Primary regulators are :RBI,TRAI, SEBI, CERC, IRDA, PNGRB, CCI, AERA, PFRDA ▪ Policymakers find significant advantages in governance through a regulator. It generally does not share the “social” obligations of the government; nor is it expected to be affected by the pressures of “interest” groups. ▪ It can provide a level playing field to all participants without fear or favour. It can build expertise matching the complexities of the task and evolves processes to enforce authority rapidly and proactively. It is better placed than the government to take unpleasant, but necessary decisions ▪ But regulators need to be accountable for their actions too.Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which their activities are monitored by the Parliament and to what extent they are accessible to the public and the regulated. REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW ▪ The challenge is to strike a balance between the advantages of governance through the regulator and the apparent threat to democratic accountability. This can be achieved, to some extent, through parliamentary oversight of regulators. ▪ In India, the Parliament scrutinises regulators by the following means: (i) question hour (ii) discussions in Parliament (iii) parliamentary committees- Committee on Estimates & Public Accounts Committee. An example through ad hoc committees is the scrutiny of the working of SEBI and RBI by the JPC on the stock market scam ▪ Other means of legislative oversight, such as annual submission of reports by regulators to Parliament, are sometimes provided in enactments or are laid down in the Rules of Procedures of theParliament. REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW ▪ The Planning Commission in 2008 and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) in 2009 have made recommendations on strengthening parliamentary oversight of regulators. Both of them recommended that regulators should be present before the standing committees to explain their actions and be subjected to legislative questions. They have also suggested that regulators submit annual reports periodically which should include the progress made on achieving their objectives. ▪ These reports should be accessible to the public. The second ARC suggested that regulators be scrutinised by sector-specific committees. It also advised that once in five years, a body of reputed experts should be constituted to propose guidelines for the evaluation of the regulator, which should be taken into account by the government while finalising the principles on which the regulator should be held accountable. REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW • In 2013, the Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission delineated four arguments in favour of having independent regulators: (a) the regulator is able to set up a specialised workforce that has superior technical knowledge; (b) this is assisted by modified human resource and other processes, when compared with the functioning of mainstream governmentdepartments; (c) with such knowledge, and close observation of the industry, an independent regulator is able to move rapidly in modifying regulations, thus giving malleability to laws;and (d) the presence of independent regulators improves legal certainty by ensuring that the regulatory approach does not fluctuate with political changes The report also pointed out that independence was a mixed blessing.When unelected officials are given strong powers, this needs to be accompanied by appropriate accountability mechanisms. However,its preferred mode of accountability was not parliamentary scrutiny but judicial review, which came under severe criticism from Raghuram Rajan,the ex-RBI Governor. • Direct accountability of regulatory bodies to Parliament was recommended by the Damodaran Committee in 2013 • In addition, a draft regulatory reform bill, approved by the government in 2013,which also made similar recommendations, did not come up for consultation. REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW INDEPENDENCE OF REGULATORY BODIES ▪ The appointment process can make regulators more accountable. In the United Kingdom and the US,the appointment of a regulator is subject to ratification by Parliament or an agency appointed by Parliament. In contrast, the appointment of a regulator in India is at the discretion of the executive. ▪ Second, currently, most regulators are financially self-sufficient, raising fees and charges for services, and consequently come under less scrutiny by Parliament.Requiring the approval of Parliament for budgets may be a way to exercise control on regulators. ▪ Third, effective scrutiny depends on the skill and resources available to the parliamentary committees. Committees, as compared to the regulators they seek to oversee, may often be under-resourced and thus fail to ensure accountability. ▪ Fourth,ad hoc scrutiny of the regulator was not adequate for effective oversight.There needs to be parliamentary reporting requirements on a regular basis. ▪ Fifth,Parliament should address the question of coordination in its scrutiny of regulators. Different regulators, while complying with their respective statutes, and executive orders, may take regulatory decisions that are in conflict with the overarching policy or the objectives of other regulators. Establishing a dedicated joint parliamentary committee to oversee regulatory bodies would address thisissue. ▪ Sixth, there needs to be a proper mechanism for appeals against regulatory orders. Each regulator needs to come out with a charter and timelines for the provision of their services (PRS Legislative Research 2012 and Select Committee on the Constitution 2004). ACCOUNTABILITY OF REGULATORS REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW ▪ Some regulators have achieved useful outcomes. However, the creation of independent sectoral regulators in India has not been accompanied by critical reflection on their role, or attention to the political, legal, and institutional contexts within which theyoperate. ▪ The existing mechanisms of legislative oversight over regulators’ performance need to be strengthened considerably to be more effective. The centrality of legislative oversight comes from the design of regulators— the functions of the executive, legislature and judiciary are combined in the role of the regulator. REGULATORY POLICY REVIEW ▪ Article 148 of the Indian Constitution mandates the appointment of Comptroller and Auditor General of India by the President of India by warrant under his hand and seal and shall only be removed from office in like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court ▪ The C AG shall perform such duties and exercise such powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and of the States and of any other authority or body as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament ▪ Thus, the Parliament accordingly enacted the CAG’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 which specifies the CAG’s duties and powers pertaining to government accounts, audit of receipts and expenditures of three tiers of the governments at the union, states and urban and rural local bodies ▪ As per Article 151, the reports of the CAG relating to the accounts of the Union shall be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before each House of Parliament. ▪ The reports of the CAG of India relating to the accounts of a State shall be submitted to the Governor of the State, who shall cause them to be laid before the Legislature of the State ▪ Duties of CAG includes audit of public companies, autonomous bodies, regulatory bodies and other public entities, where there is a specific legislative provision to make CAG audit mandatory in the acts by which these bodies were created. CAGCAG ▪ Compliance Audit: It is sometimes called transaction audit in which some selected transactions of an entity for a particular financial year are chosen for audit scrutiny. It is seen whether transactions are done as per rules and regulations, with proper sanctions and whether it adheres to principles of financial propriety ▪ Financial Audit: Under this, audit reports prepared by various departments, statutory corporations, government companies and other autonomous bodies and authorities are checked for their veracity and truthfulness and whether financial statements are presented with adequate disclosures ▪ Performance Audit: It seeks to establish at what cost and to what degree the policies, programme and projects are working. In addition to all the financial audit checks, the Performance Audit seeks to assess whether a pro- gramme, scheme or activity deploys sound means to achieve its intended socio-economic objectives ▪ Propriety Audit: Look into the ‘wisdom, faithfulness and economy’ of government expenditure and comment on the wasteful essay. This, however, is discretionary ▪ The Secret service expenditure is a limitation on the auditing powers of CAG ▪ It’s role in auditing of public corporations is limited. CAG • Uphold the Constitution of India and laws of Parliament in the field of financial administration • In a way, agent of the Parliament as it conducts audit of expenditure on behalf of the Parliament • Britain vs. India- CAG of Britain has powers of both Comptroller as well as Auditor General, unlike India. We only have the latter. • In other words, in Britain, the executive can draw money from the public exchequer only with the approval of the CAG • Much of the government expenditure is kept out of CAG Audit by Governments: Now only 60% of the government expenditure comes under CAG. PPPs are also out of it’s ambit. • Politicization of the office- former CAGs have been appointed as Chairman of Bank Board Bureau and joined political parties to contest elections • Issue with redacted pricing- in the Rafael case, citing security concerns. • In India, Internal Audit is very weak and government departments see the external audit mechanisms as fault finding exercise rather than constructive recommendations for their working. • Government agencies don’t give the information required by the CAG because of mistrust. There is no provision regarding time frame VARIOUS ISSUES CAG THANK YOU","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
