What consequences follow when such a declaration remains in force?  Role of Governor  Emergency Review  Judiciary- pendency, PIL, AIJS PREVIOUS YEARS’ QUESTIONS Focal Areas 3 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish GOVERNOR APPOINTMENT OF THE GOVERNOR  Article 153 states that every state shall have a governor  Article 154 states that the executive power of the state shall be vested in the Governor  U/a 155 it is the President of India who appoints the Governor; however, he exercises this power on the aid and advice of PM/ CoM. Over the period of time, in order to ensure smooth function of the affairs of the state, a convention has grown where the Chief Minister of the state is consulted before appointment.  Hence, the office of the Governor is a nominated one and not elected. The reasons for this are:  Nominated governor will promote all India unity and not separatist provincial tendency.  Since he is only a nominal head, no point of spending huge amount of money or energy for his election.  An elected governor will belong to a party, hence, will not be impartial and neutral  Conflicts will arise between C M and Governor if both are elected by people. TENURE/REMOVAL  Article 156(1) clearly states that the governor holds the office during the pleasure of the President i.e. as long as the central executive wats him in the office. Hence, he can be removed by the Centre on any grounds which the President is not bound to disclose.  Subject to this overall condition, he holds the office for a term of five years [(Article 156(1)] and can resign early by writing to the President.  Unlike the President, the governor is not impeached because he holds the office during the pleasure of the President. Since he is a political appointee of whose appointment is made on political conditions, it can also be terminated on political considerations. Therefore, no grounds have been specified for his removal. 4 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Over time, the governor’s tenure became a very burning federal issue as it was believed that central government used uncertainty of tenure, including his transfer, as a ground to influence his decision, thereby making it difficult for him to function with complete impartiality and as an independent constitutional authority. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF GOVERNOR’S REMOVAL  Therefore, in order to prevent governors being completely at the mercy of Centre, the SC in B.P Singhal V Union of India held –  Governors can’t be dismissed arbitrarily on the ground that center has lost confidence in him and he does not agree with Centre’s ideologies and policies.  Just because he holds office during the pleasure of the President does not make him an employee or servant of the Union Government.  The constant threat of removal makes him subservient to the Union Govt, hence certain safeguards have to be read into article 156(1).  Hence, the court held that if an aggrieved person can show that his removal was arbitrary, mala fide, capricious or whimsical, he can call upon the central government to disclose to the court the material upon which the President took the decision.  Therefore, even if the reason for his removal is not to be assigned, a limited judicial review is allowed if the removal is arbitrary, mala fide etc.  ‘Doctrine of Pleasure without limitation’ cannot be applied in India where the rule of law prevails. POSITION OF GOVERNOR IN A STATE  The governor plays a dual role – he is the head of the State as well as a representative of the Centre in the State.  As representative of the Centre he is a vital link/ channel of communication between the Centre and the state. It is his duty to keep the Centre informed of the affairs of the state. This helps the Centre discharge its constitutional responsibilities towards the State. He acts as an agent of the Centre when a proclamation of emergency is made u/a 356  As a Constitutional Head of the State, he appoints the Chief Minister and other Ministers and discharges several important functions in relation to the state legislature. As he has a fixed term, he assures continuity in state administration while the CMs come and go.  Thus, he is a key functionary in the system envisaged by our Constitution. 5 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION/RELATION WITH COUNCIL OF MINISTERS  The relation between the governor and his Council of Ministers is similar to that between President and the Union CoM, i.e. he has to act on the aid and advice given by the CoM except in all the cases where the Constitution authorizes the Governor to exercise powers ‘in his discretion’.  Article 163(1) says there will be Council of Ministers to aid and advice the Governor except in the cases he has to act in his discretion.  Article 163(2) then says if any questions arises with respect to whether a matter falls under Governors’ discretionary power or not, the decision of the Governor with regards to the question shall be final and anything done by the governor in his discretion will not be called into question.  Article 163(3) does not allow the courts to inquire into what advice was tendered by the CoM to the Governor.  The Constitution makers conferred explicit and far wide discretionary power on the Governor because as the representative of the Centre governor has to serve as eye and ears of the Centre and so needs independence and discretion in certain matters and also because he is an important link between the center and state to maintain unity and integrity of India.  Though various articles of the Constitution expressly require Governor’s discretion but in all other matters he has to act in harmony (on advice) with his CoM (Shamsher Singh V State of Punjab) because constitution does not aim to provide parallel administration within the state by allowing governor to go against the advice of CoM. Constitutional position of governor is different from that of the President as:  firstly, constitution explicitly provides for governor to act in his discretion but no such possibility has been envisaged for the President,  secondly while the President can ask the Union CoM to reconsider any advice, no such provision is there with respect to Governor and,  thirdly, 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act , 1976 made ministerial advice binding on President but with respect to Governor no such provision is there. But this hardly makes difference in reality because the position is similar to what existed prior to the amendment. 6 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish DISCRETIONARY POWER OF THE GOVERNOR  The Governor has to discharge certain functions in his discretion ‘by or under’ the constitution. This means that his discretionary power need not be always express but may be necessarily implied.  In the following cases governor has Constitutional discretion i.e. constitution mentions governor to exercise these functions in his discretion/opinion/ independently of the CoM.  Reserving a bill for President’s consideration u/a 200.  Governor’s report recommending imposition of governor’s rule in the State u/a 356.  While exercising his functions as the administrator of an adjoining Union Territory u/a 239(2).  Determining the amount payable by the Government of Assam to the district councils as royalty accruing from licenses of mineral exploration.  In addition to the above the Governor has certain ‘special responsibilities’ to discharge u/a 371,which practically means his discretion and though he is, in case of special responsibility, to consult CoM but the final decision will be his individual judgement. These include establishing separate development boards of certain areas in Gujrat and Maharashtra, administration of tribal areas in Assam, hill area in Manipur, law and order in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland etc. SITUATIONAL DISCRETION Appointment of the Chief minister u/a 164(1): When no party has achieved a clear cut majority in the elections or when the chief Minister suddenly dies and there is no obvious successor ,in those situations' governor can call any person to form the government who he thinks can command majority.  In Pratap Singh Raojirao vs Governor of Goa , the court held that for the purpose of the appointment of the Chief Minister, Governor acts in his sole discretion and while taking decision in his sole discretion he enjoys immunity under Article 361 of the Constitution.  About the appointment of a non-legislator as the Chief Minister in B.R. Kapur vs State of Tamil Nadu, court held that a non-legislator can be made Chief Minister only if, he has the qualification for membership of the Legislature prescribed by Article 173 of the Constitution and is not disqualified from the membership thereof by reason of the disqualification set out in Article 191 of the Constitution on the date of his appointment.  In Anil Kumar Jha v UOI ,governor appointed the leader of a party which was not commanding majority as C M .court held into be arbitrary and mala fide exercise of power  Dismissal of Ministry when it cannot prove the majority in the house: Since CoM u/a 164(2) is collectively responsible to the state legislative assembly hence if a ministry has lost confidence of the house but refuses to resign, in that case Governor can dissolve the Ministry 7 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  In Mahabir Prasad Sharma vs Prafulla Chandra Ghose, the Calcutta High Court has ruled that if the Council of Ministers refuses to vacate the office of ministers, after the defeat of the confidence motion in the House, then the Governor may withdraw his pleasure. The Court also held that the right of the Governor to withdraw his pleasure during which the minister is to hold office is absolute, unrestricted and unfettered and the exercise of discretion in withdrawing the pleasure cannot be called in question in a court of law.  In Jagdambika Pal vs State of U.P., the Supreme Court directed to convene a special session of Legislative Assembly and to have a composite floor test between contending parties to ascertain who out of two (Sh. Kalyan Singh and Sh. Jagdambika Pal) enjoys a majority in the Assembly. It shows that the Governor’s discretion to dismiss the ministry should be exercised only when the Chief Minister fails to prove the majority on the floor of the House by any means.  In Jogendra Nath vs State of Assam, commenting about the discretionary power of the Governor in appointing or dismissing the Chief Minister, the Gauhati High Court observed that 'the repository of power to appoint Chief Minister or to withdraw the pleasure contemplated under Article 164 and/or dismissal of ministry are exclusively pleasure-cumdiscretion of the Governor. He is the sole and exclusive authority to appoint a Chief Minister’. Dissolution of State Legislative Assembly:  Various Governors have adopted different approaches in similar situations in regard to dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.  The advice of a Chief Minister enjoying majority support in the Assembly to dissolve the house is normally binding on the Governor.  However, where the Chief Minister had lost such support, some Governors refused to dissolve the Legislative Assembly on his advice, while others in similar situations, accepted his advice, and dissolved the Assembly. IS GOVERNOR AN AGENT OF CENTRE?  Governor is an appointee of the President, and holds office “during the pleasure of the President.”  President is bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers (Article 74), in effect it is the Central Government that appoints and removes the Governors:  “Pleasure of the President \"actually refers to will and wish of the Central Government.  The Constitution is strictly against compromising the relative autonomy of the States. Appointing Governors due to:  Common political ideologies 8 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  or to reward past acts of the persons  Leads to over-centralization, hence giving rise to negative terms such as ‘agent of center', 'rubber stamp’, etc.  Recent appointments of Governors do not abide by Constitutional mandate. Keeping in mind that BJP is in power at center:  In Congress governed Rajasthan, Kalraj Mishra (who is a politician and former cabinet minister in the BJP led NDA government of Narendra Modi) was appointed as Governor(2019)  Shri Bandaru Dattatreya (former Lok Sabha member for BJP) was appointed as the Governor in Himachal Pradesh in 2019.  Smt.Tamilisai Soundararajan was appointed as the Governor of Telangana; former state head of BJP in Tamil Nadu.  BJP member C.Vidyasagar Rao is replaced by another veteran BJP leader Bhagat Singh Koshyari in Maharashtra.  Arif Mohammed Khan has been appointed as the Governor in Kerala; he earlier quit the Rajiv Gandhi government over the Shah Bano case, has been cited many times by BJP.  Unless the party ruling the State is a non-BJP party, there is no check over the appointed Governor.  Though Constitution separates Centre and State, granting the latter relative autonomy, due to this biased nominated appointment of Governors is shrinking Governor’s roles down to clearly and distinctly become Agent of the Centre, implying, Governor was never meant to be Agent of the Centre, but is in danger of getting reduced to it due to biased practices.  There exists urgent necessity for depoliticization of the post of Governor. REFORMS IN THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR  “The governor is the linchpin of the constitutional apparatus in the state” , said the Sarkaria Commission. His role has emerged as one of the key issues in Union state relations and has been criticized for want of ‘impartiality and sagacity’.  Regarding appointments Sarkaria commission said the effective consultation between the center and the C M should be there by amending Article 155. Further governor should be eminent, come from outside the State, be not too intimately connected with the local politics of the State; and not recently haven taken too great part in politics. particularly in the recent past. 9 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  However the Punchhi Commission said that phrases like eminent ,detached figure is too vague and hence strict guideline should be adopted.  As regards the removal, the Sarkaria commission recommended that governors five year term should not be disturbed except very rarely and that too compelling reasons and should the governor be transferred or his tenure terminated, the central government may lay and explanatory statement before the parliament.  Punchhi Commission recommended that the phrase during pleasure of president should be removed from article 155 and governor should be impeached on same ground as the President. Commissions to improve Centre-State Relations Summary of Commission Recommendations for Governor’s Office Sarkaria Commission (1983)  Submitted report in 1988.  Recommended changes in Centre- State relation, especially in areas relating to legislative matters, the role of Governors, and the use of Article 356.

The great Hindu Jurist of ancient times Manu-the law giver, recognize \"Appad Dharma\" as one of the Supreme duties or Dharma of a king as protector of his subjects against disorder and anarchy.  The emergency provisions under Indian constitution can be traced back to the British rule in India, when by Act of parliament crown established its sovereignty over company's territories in India in 1861.  The Governor General under the provisions exercised wide powers both legislative and executive. He was also given power to legislate for emergencies.  These powers were very sparingly used till the outbreak of First World War, but between 1914 to 1918 it was used for about 26 times. Judicial challenges to invocation of these powers were met with unsuccessful attempts.  In 1919 the famous Rowlett Act was passed. This law was intended to be used as an emergency measures, very stringent in nature, it was set out to control the terrorist activities in India.  Then came the Government of India Act 1919 which reaffirmed the powers of Governor General to promulgate ordinances in emergency.  Similar powers were conferred by the Government of India Act 1935.Under this Act. The Governor General could issue a proclamation whenever he believed 'a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India was threatened by war or internal disturbance . It was used in 1939 for the first time following declaration of war between Britain and Germany. CENTRAL POWER CONSOLIDATION EXERCISE  National – 352:  War, external aggression, Armed Rebellion  Applied to a specific part of India (42CA, 1976) or even the whole country  Three times- 1962, 1971, 1975  State – 356:  Failure of constitutional machinery in a state  Imposed more than 125 times  Financial – 360:  Threat to financial stability or credit of India. Not imposed so far 12 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO EMERGENCY  Art 22 : Nation had gone through the experience of harshness of such powers so there was discontent about its inclusion. Tremendous misuse of the power was feared which proved right in the future  Article 123 and 213: Presidents and the Governor were empowered to issued ordinances if the situation in their opinion so demands. This power was misused many times by both central and state governments. The Supreme Court declared that this powered is not immune from judicial review EVOLUTION 38th Constitution Amendment Act of 1975-  It excluded judicial review of the satisfaction of President under Article 352(1)  The amendment provided for another proclamation of emergency even when there was already one proclamation was in existence. 39th Amendment Act of 1975-  It introduced changes in the method of deciding election disputes relating to the four high officials of the State, viz, president, Vice President, Prime Minister and the Speaker. 13 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  As regards the President and Vice- President, the basic change introduced was that jurisdiction was taken away from the supreme Court to decide any doubts and disputes and disputes arising in connection with their election.  Elections of the Prime Minister and the speaker to the Parliament were also taken out of the election dispute settling mechanism envisaged in Art.329. 42 nd CA, 1976  It is the most controversial and debatable of constitutional amendments ever undertaken in India  The most objectionable feature was that it was undertaken during emergency period, when most of the opposition leaders were detained in jail under preventive detention.  Some of the changes were intended towards more powerful executive away from Judicial scrutiny 44th CA, 1978  The expression \"internal disturbance\" was substituted with the expression \"armed rebellion.\"  The advice to the President to proclaim emergency shall be rendered by the Cabinet in writing. The Emergency Proclamation, which was to be approved by both houses of parliament by resolution, passed by a simple, majority was amended to be approved by special majority.  The proclamation once approved could remain in force for any length of time without fresh parliamentary approval. Now this amendment provided for its continuance for the period, which could be continued for a further period of 6 months if approved again.  Ten percent or more members of Lok Sabha can consider a bill for disapproving the proclamation.  The jurisdiction of the high court to issue writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus will not be suspended so far as Articles 20 & 21 is concerned.  It provided that a person cannot be detained beyond 2 months unless the detention has been approved by the Advisory board and the power conferred on the parliament to provide for longer period has been taken away.  The most remarkable change the amendment made to Article 359 was to the effect that fundamental rights guaranteed by the Articles 20 & 21 could not be suspended by Presidential order under Article 359  SC review instated 14 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish ISSUES  Armed rebellion has not been defined. How many rebels or what types of arms, over what territorial area would constitute armed rebellion.  Does the written cabinet advice to the President provide additional safeguards against the misuse emergency powers? According to him only 'ministers with moral courage' could be trusted under this provision.  Structural weakness of the proposed safeguards against emergency control mechanism is that they do not prevent the dissolution of Lok Sabha during emergency  As malafide proclamation of emergency is being made justiciable there is doubt that judiciary alone can provide an institutional safeguard for ensuring that the emergency powers are not misused. 15 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish JUDICIARY INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY  Separation of Powers - 3 main branches of the State, namely the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary; each endowed with separate powers and functions, such that the operation of one is not subservient to the other. Thus, each wing of the State is independent and autonomous in itself.  Courts of the country not answerable to any other branch of the Government.  Judiciary can serve as an unbiased third party in the adjudication of cases.  Freedom in appointment of members of the higher judiciary. SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHEREIN BIAS WAS REFLECTED? (To build context)  During the era of the Emergency, wherein the State dictated the functioning of the Courts.  Three senior judges were superseded in the appointment of Justice A.N. Ray as CJI  Government returned the recommendation for elevation of Justice KM Joseph, Uttarakhand High Court to the Supreme Court  Justice Ranjan Gogoi's appointment to the Rajya Sabha after several pro- government decisions by the Supreme Court SINCE WHEN IS INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY PART OF BASIC STRUCTURE? (SC JUDGEMENT)  Independence of the Judiciary was declared as being part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution in SP Gupta vs. Union of India (1981), popularly known as the First Judges Case  Reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of Supreme Court Advocates-on- Record vs. Union of India (1987), popularly known as the Second Judges Case. APPOINTMENT & REMOVAL NOTES:  Judges of the Supreme Court (SC) as well as High Court (HC) are appointed by the President of the country [SC Judges under Article 124 (2) and HC Judges under Article 217 (1)]. 16 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  The Chief Justice of India (CJI) is appointed by the President, in consultation with judges of the SC as well as the HCs. However, as per convention, usually, the senior most judge of the SC is appointed as the CJI.  The Chief Justice of a HC is appointed by the President, in consultation with the CJI and the Governor of the state. In HCs too, convention dictates that the senior most judge of the HC is appointed as the Chief Justice.  The process for appointment of judges of the SC was streamlined in the Third Judges Case of 1998, which established a Collegium, consisting of the 4 senior most judges of the Supreme Court excluding the CJI.  The Collegium recommends names to the President, who then appoints the recommended persons as judges of the SC.  Judges of the HC are appointed by the President on the basis of recommendations made by a Collegium consisting of 2 of the senior most judges of the SC excluding the CJI and in consultation with the Chief Justice of the respective HC. QUALIFICATIONS  For SC -  Must be a citizen of India; and  Judge of a High Court for 5 years; or  10 years' experience as a practicing advocate of a HC; or  Distinguished jurist as per the President  For HC -  Must be a citizen of India; and  Holding any judicial office for 10 years; or  10 years' experience as a practicing advocate of a HC.  The current process reflects plurality and concurrence in the system of appointment of judges.  Current Affairs: The Parliament enacted the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019, pursuant to which the number of SC judges increased from 31 to 34. 17 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish REMOVAL OF JUDGES  Judges of the SC as well as the HC are removed by President upon the impeachment of the judge by the Parliament.  The Parliament may remove (not impeach) a sitting judge on grounds of proved misbehaviour and incapacity.  The Judges Enquiry Act, 1968 provides the detailed procedure for removal of judges.  A judge is removed by the Parliament by way of a motion passed by a special majority of the members of the House, i.e. two-thirds majority of members present and voting such that the said number is greater than half of the total strength of the House. IMPACT OF APPOINTMENTS AND REMOVALS ON INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY?  The current system of appointment of judges is primarily controlled by the Judiciary itself.  The Collegium system ensures that senior members of the Higher Judiciary are directly involved in the appointment of Judges to the Higher Judiciary with minimal to no interference from the Legislature or the Executive.  The recommendations of the Collegium are customarily accepted by the President. This ensures that the Independence of the Judiciary remains sacrosanct.  However, given that the President always acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Government does play a role in the appointment of Judges. [e.g. of when recommendation not followed - Justice KM Joseph of Uttarakhand High Court, Justice Krishna Bhat (sessions judge)]  Process of removal of judges rests entirely with the Parliament. This acts a measure for checks and balances within the wings of the State. PRIMARY PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT PROCESS?  Primary problem - Judiciary appoints itself - possibility of backdoor politics,  lack of transparency, objectivity and accountability.  lack of detailed and specific guidelines for appointment of judges further  process for impeachment of judges is extremely detailed and tedious, therefore, judicial appointments are rarely challenged.  [hollow independence of the judiciary. Although the President, as the Head of State, appoints the judges, the President is, in reality, bound by the recommendation of the Council of Ministers, or the elected representatives. Consequently, the Government/Executive is 18 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish indirectly involved in the appointment of judges, and as a result, in the functioning of the Judiciary]. WHY DOES INDIA HAVE SUCH A PROCESS?  Process of appointment and removal of the Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts is reflective of the separation of powers between the three wings of State  System of inter se checks and balances between wings of Government in place within the constitutional machinery of the country, where no one wing of the State becomes vested with ultimate power. STEPS TAKEN SO FAR TO BETTER THE PROCESS (NJAC, Collegium reforms)  Process of appointment of judges was sought to be amended by the introduction of the National Judicial Appointment Commission Act, 2014.  The NJAC Act sought to address the criticisms that the Judiciary appointed itself, which led to lack of transparency and objectivity in the appointment process.  NJAC Act was struck down by the SC in the year 2015:  for failure to follow the due procedure laid down to enact such a statute, and  on account of the NJAC Act violating the Independence of the Judiciary, and resultantly the Basic Structure of the Constitution.  Simultaneously, the SC revived the Collegium System and subsequently directed the Government to supplement the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of Judges of SC and HC taking into account factors like eligibility, transparency in the appointment process, establishment of Secretariat and Complaint mechanism in consultation with the SC Collegium/CJI.  Reforms to the Collegium System - such as online disclosure of meetings of the collegium.  Office of CJI brought under the scope of the RTI Act, by SC, which held that Office of CJI is a 'public authority'. 19 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMITTEES ETC. AS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS?  14th Law Commission Report (LCR) suggested that every appointment to the High Court and the Supreme Court should be made with the concurrence of the CJI.  80th LCR suggested that the CJI consult three senior most colleagues during appointments  121st LCR recommended the constitution of National Judicial Commission  High Courts Arrears Committee in the 1970s suggested that exercise for filling the vacancy must start well in advance so that the selection can be finalized by the time the vacancy occurs. It recommended that if the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not dealt with within one month from the date of its receipt, the State Government must be deemed to have accepted the recommendation and action must be taken by the Central Government for expeditious disposal of the proposal.  The NCRWC recommended the setting up of NJAC with detailed suggestions as to composition, procedure of appointment and even removal of judges. WOMEN & JUDICIARY • For the first time there are four sitting women judges in the SC. • While the primary criteria for SC appointments has always been seniority, some argue that gender should also be an important consideration. • 76 out of the 650 occupied High Court judges are currently women. This amounts to 11.7% of all the current judges of the 25 High Courts in India • In its 71-year history, the SC has developed certain unwritten criteria for the selection of judges, outside of what is prescribed by the Constitution. The most relevant criteria is seniority, with the most senior High Court (HC) judges being preferred for appointment. Usually, Chief Justices are appointed to the SC. Some argue that this unwritten criterion does not take gender diversity into account, and that it should be included. • In August 2021, three women judges were appointed to the Supreme Court. B.V. Nagarathna J is in line to become the first woman Chief Justice of India (CJI) in 2027. It appears that alongside seniority, ensuring gender diversity was also an important consideration with this round of appointments. • It appears that appointing diverse judges has been given priority while seniority has taken a backseat. For instance, although Akhil Kureshi (Chief Justice of the Tripura HC) is one of the senior-most HC judges, he was not appointed to the SC. Meanwhile, Nagarathna J was 33rd in the High Court seniority list before she was elevated to the Supreme Court. 20 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish Judicial Appointments: Merit, Transparency and Diversity • Since 1950, there have been 247 Supreme Court judges. Only eight have been women. As of June, only 76 out of 650 HC judges were women. Hima Kohli CJ (Telangana HC) was the only woman HC Chief Justice. She has now been appointed to the SC which leaves the HCs with no woman Chief Justices. • The higher judiciary has not taken active measures to ensure gender diversity. Merit has been seen as the primary criteria for appointments. Seniority of HC judges has been considered to be a proxy for merit in discussions regarding Supreme Court appointments. This stems from the 14th, 79th and 80th reports from the Law Commission of India where communal, political and regional considerations were rejected. • The Supreme Court has always considered seniority as a convention for appointments. This was briefly rebuked by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when she appointed Justice A.N. Ray as CJI in 1973. CJI Ray was appointed despite there being three sitting judges more senior than him. Following the Emergency, the Court further prioritised seniority in order to limit the interference of the executive. • However, making seniority the guiding principle for appointment arguably excludes marginalised groups in India, including women. These groups face multiple barriers of entry in gaining positions in the higher judiciary. • Along with this, India is the only constitutional democracy where the judiciary appoints its own judges. Some argue that this results in a lack of transparency and accountability in the collegium’s decisions. The considerations and the discussions behind these decisions are not available to the public There is a lack of clarity on the criteria for appointment. • On the other hand, the South African Constitution provides for a Judicial Service Commission comprising members of the judiciary, executive and legislature. Further the Constitution expressly provides that the judiciary should reflect the racial and gender composition of the country. This has resulted in a radical change in the composition of the South African Judiciary. Between 1994 and 2011, the number of women in the judiciary had increased from 9 to 61. SC & SUO-MOTO • A ‘suo-moto’ power is granted by S. 23 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 in regard to contempt of court. Many other common law jurisdictions give Courts this power. However, the use of the procedure in writ or judicial review jurisdiction has been novel to India, where it is used to scrutinise or test executive (in)action. • Courts often exercise their suo-moto jurisdiction by taking up matters based on media reports or act on letters written to them. • Articles 32 and 226 confer the Supreme Court (SC) and High Courts (HC) wide constitutional and public law powers. These powers have been interpreted to take up cases of their own 21 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish volition – without any petition being formally filed. Suo moto powers have historically developed contemporaneously with public interest litigation, where procedural requirements were relaxed in the interest of justice. • Courts often take up matters based on media reports or act on letters written to them. For example, in Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration (1980), the Supreme Court took up the matter based on a letter written to a judge about the torture of prisoners and violations of prisoners’ fundamental rights. Suo moto powers have also been widely used to tackle environmental issues, including air pollution in Delhi and the remediation of polluted rivers. • Since 1990, the SC has heard nearly 50 suo moto cases, often dealing with human rights and government policy. Several cases have been criticised for allowing the courts to undertake ‘heroic interventions’ that often infringe upon the powers of the legislature and the executive. • Media support and public applause received by suo moto petitions encourages activist judges to focus on the ‘immediacy and effectiveness’ of providing a solution, without carefully considering the views of parties involved leading to rule of law concerns. • Earlier this year, the HC and SC used their suo moto powers to hear COVID related issues, such as access to essential supplies. The SC COVID related orders effectively compelled the Union to draft a policy, and change their crisis management method. Judicial intervention in this instance was largely welcomed, in light of executive inaction, perceived or otherwise. 22 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONTEMPT OF COURT WHAT IS THE CONTEMPT OF COURT?  Contempt of Court refers to the offence of showing disrespect to the dignity or authority of a court.  As a concept, Contempt of court proposes to protect judicial institutions from motivated attacks and unwarranted criticism.  Used as a legal mechanism to punish those who lower its authority, in order to safeguard the interests of the public and public confidence in the administration of justice.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their contempt powers from the Constitution (contempt of court is one of the restrictions on freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(2))  Article 129 of the Constitution conferred on the Supreme Court the power to punish contempt of itself.  Article 215 conferred a corresponding power on the High Courts.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (“the Act”), gives statutory backing to the idea. The Act was significantly amended by the 2006 Amendment to the Act. THE CONTEMPT OF COURTS ACT, 1971  The Act specifies that the Supreme Court as well as the High Courts have the power to try and punish the offence of contempt.  High Courts also have the power to punish acts of contempt against courts subordinate to them.  In addition to these courts, certain administrative tribunals also have been given the power to punish for contempt, in their governing statutes  The Contempt of Court Act, 1971, outlines the procedure in relation to investigation and punishment for contempt.  According to the Act, contempt is divided into civil and criminal contempt.  The Act provides that a charge of contempt may be brought against a judge, magistrate or any other person acting judicially, for contempt of her own court or any other court in a manner similar to any other individual. The provisions of the Act shall be applicable in the same manner to such persons, as any other individual. 23 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish *‘Scandalising the Court’ broadly refers to statements or publications which have the effect of undermining public confidence in the judiciary. The punishment for contempt of court is simple imprisonment for a term up to six months and/or a fine of up to ₹ 2,000. WHY IN THE NEWS? Contempt of Court has recently been in the news for the infamous case against Advocate Prashant Bhushan for two of his tweets, regarding the functioning of the Apex Court as well as the Chief Justice of India (Justice Bobade), which have held to be in contempt by the Supreme Court. Prashant Bhushan was fined Re. 1 as a penalty for the contempt. SPECIFIC POINTS  What is not contempt of court?  Fair and accurate reporting of judicial proceedings.  Fair criticism on the merits of a judicial order after a case is heard and disposed of.  Is truth a defence against a contempt charge? 24 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Initially Truth not a defence against a contempt charge.  Amendment to the Contempt of Court Act in 2006 introduced truth as a valid defence, if it was in public interest and was invoked in a bona fide manner. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR  Reduction in respect to the Judiciary: Amendment to the definition of contempt may reduce the overall impact of the law and lessen the respect that people have for courts and their authority and functioning.  Constitutional Source of Contempt Power: Supreme Court and High Courts derive their contempt powers from the Constitution. The Contempt of Court Act, 1971, Act only outlines the procedure in relation to investigation and punishment for contempt. Therefore, deletion of the offence from the Act will not impact the inherent constitutional powers of the superior courts to punish anyone for its contempt.  Impact on Subordinate Courts: The Contempt of Court Act allows High Courts to punish for contempt of subordinate courts. Thus, if the definition of contempt is removed, subordinate courts will suffer as there will be no remedy to address cases of their contempt. The Court reject that Law or any of its parts which is found to be unconstitutional or against the constitution.  Ambiguity: Amending the definition of contempt will lead to ambiguity; superior courts will exercise power of contempt under the constitution and may give multiple definitions and interpretations to what constitutes contempt. Retaining the definition fulfils the purpose of clarity according to the commission.  Adequate Safeguards: The Law Commission of India noted that there are several safeguards built into the Act to protect against its misuse. For instance, the Act contains provisions which lay down cases that do not amount to contempt and cases where contempt is not punishable. ARGUMENTS AGAINST CONTEMPT OF COURT  Against Civil Liberties: Contempt law in conflict with freedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right.  Use of contempt law by judiciary causes chilling effect on exercise of freedom of speech.  Former Justice of Supreme Court, V.R. Krishna Iyer, famously termed the law of contempt as “having a vague and wandering jurisdiction, with uncertain boundaries; contempt law, regardless of the public good, may unwittingly trample upon civil liberties”. 25 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Wide Scope of Contempt: The definition of criminal contempt in India is extremely wide, and can be easily invoked. Courts may also initiate proceedings suo motu.  Truth and Good Faith as Defences are seldom entertained, although included as defences under the Contempt of Courts Act.  International Disuse: Contempt of court has practically become obsolete in foreign democracies, with various jurisdictions recognising it is an archaic law.  England abolished the offence of “scandalizing the court” in 2013.  Canada ties its test for contempt to real, substantial and immediate dangers to the administration.  American courts also no longer use the law of contempt in response to comments on judges or legal matters. CONCLUSION The Law Commission of India looked into the issue of Contempt and recommended that the provision for contempt of courts be retained. However, it also recommended the definition of contempt in the Contempt of Court Act should be restricted to civil contempt, i.e., wilful disobedience of judgments of the court. 26 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish PENDENCY STATE OF PENDENCY IN INDIAN JUDICIARY  Pendency of cases at the SC has increased in 2021 by 7.3%. Currently 69,555 cases are pending.  Approx. 3.5 crore cases pending in the judicial system (approx. 88% of pending cases in lower judiciary, i.e. district and subordinate courts).  More than 64% of all cases are pending for more than 1 year.  Ease of Doing Business Report of the World Bank for 2018 and 2019 shows that the time taken to decide a case has remained static at 1,445 days.  Consistent increase in pendency of cases in the last decade, with the highest number of cases pending in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  Number of under-trials in prison is more than double that of convicts. REASONS OF PENDENCY  Increased awareness of rights of common man due to socio-economic advances, which has also improved capacity to sue.  New mechanisms that have simplified the process of judicial cognizance (E.g.: Public Interest Litigation) and new rights granted to the general public (E.g.: Right to Information), which increases awareness and emboldens litigants.  Vacancies in Judicial posts and lack of sufficient judges, especially in lower judiciary.  Insufficient number of courts.  Increased litigation from the Government (e.g. tax and revenue cases).  Current Affairs POI - Vodafone tax case that has continued and fresh suits filed by the Government, despite a Supreme Court judgement in the matter.  Poor judicial quality in lower courts, dissatisfaction amongst litigants.  Archaic/Vague Laws requiring interpretation from higher judiciary.  Lack of strict timelines for strict proceedings. Repeated adjournments (Tareekh pe tareekh!). 27 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONSEQUENCES OF PENDENCY  Denies the poor man and under-trial prisoners their due justice.  Economic reforms - only on paper without speedier justice system.  Foreign investors hesitate to invest in India due to the delayed delivery of justice, which affects the success of programs like ‘Make in India’.  Judiciary becomes overburdened; loses efficacy and efficiency.  Erodes social infrastructure.  Overcrowding of prisons.  Financial drain of the coffers of the State; judicial delays cost India an estimated 1.5% of its GDP annually.  High time, energy and money costs for litigant/common man, resulting in loss of the common man’s faith in the justice system. RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS PENDENCY  Introduce time limits for all cases and having a definite time frame to dispose the cases by setting annual targets, and action plans for the subordinate judiciary and the High Courts (E.g. Introduction of rigid time frames for filing of pleadings in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, by way of Amendment to the Civil Procedure Code.)  Increase in number of judges (E.g., The increase in the number of Supreme Court judges from 31 to 34 in 2019.)  Decentralize working of the Supreme Court by introducing Regional Benches (this recommendation was also put forth by the Law Commission.)  Increase working hours of courts.  Increase functioning and efficiency of ADR; effective utilization of mechanisms such as Lok Adalats and Gram Nyayalayas.  Establishment of Tribunals, Fast Track Courts and Special Courts to dispense important cases at the earliest.  Introduction of the All-India Judicial Services (AIJS) for appointment of members to the lower judiciary.(The Union Government plans to introduce a bill for implementation of the AIJS after consultation with the higher judiciary)  Better case and court management.  Revamping of National Judicial Data Grid. 28 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Use of Information technology (IT) solutions:  Digitization of court registry.  E-filing of suits across courts.  Video conferencing hearings.  Digitization of court database, use of ERP tools for database management.  Real time updates of case status, cause list etc.  (Supreme Court and most High Courts as well as several tribunals and registries have effectively engaged IT solutions for conduct of court proceedings during the SARS- COV-2 pandemic related lockdown.)  Malimath Committee Report  Increase in number of courts and judges.  Reduction in period of vacations for the Courts by 21 days.  ‘Arrears Eradication Scheme’ – pending cases prioritized and settled through Lok Adalats; no adjournment allowed. MEASURES IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE PENDENCY  Centre has introduced a mobile application ‘JustIS’ for efficient court management by judges. (App developed by the National Informatics Centre.)  Introduction of “fast-track” courts, jail-adalats (“prison courts”), and plea-bargaining.  Campaign Mode to reduce pendency through Pendency Reduction Campaign in second half of the year 2011.  Resolution aimed at prioritization of disposal of cases through Mission Mode was passed in April 2016.  The Supreme Court, in the case of Hussain & Anr. v. Union of India (2017), issued timelines for completion of criminal trials and appeals and directed High Courts to plan and monitor the speed of trials.  The Supreme Court has, in recent times, given strict guidelines to not allow pleas for unnecessary or groundless adjournments, used as dilatory tactics. 29 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish ALL INDIA JUDICIAL SERVICES WHAT IS ALL INDIA JUDICIAL SERVICES (AIJS)? - OVERVIEW  AIJS first proposed by the 14th Report of the Law Commission of India in 1958.  The recommendation aimed at creating a centralised cadre of District Judges that would draw better talent.  At present, various high courts and state service commissions hold exams to recruit judicial officers.  The idea was proposed again in the Law Commission Report of 1978, which discussed delays and arrears of cases in the lower courts.  In 1992, the Supreme Court in All India Judges’ Assn. (1) v. Union of India directed the Centre to set up an AIJS. In a 1993 review of the judgment, however, the court left the Centre at liberty to take the initiative on the issue.  In 2006, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice in its 15th Report backed the idea of a pan-Indian judicial service, and also prepared a draft Bill.  In 2017, the Supreme Court took Suo-motu cognizance of the issue of appointment of district judges, and mooted a “Central Selection Mechanism”. WHY IT IS REQUIRED?  Recruitment in lower judiciary happens state-wise resulting in lower standard of district court judges.  Many judicial posts remain vacant despite an extraordinarily high number of pending cases.  To standardise process of appointments to lower judiciary.  To create a carder of dedicated, professional judicial officers. WHO RECOMMENDED AIJS?  The idea of judicial service was introduced as early as in the 1950s.  The provision of AIJS was also included in Article 312 of the Constitution through the 42nd amendment in 1976.  NITI Aayog, in its report, ‘Strategy for New India@75’, also mooted the creation of an All India Judicial Service (AIJS) for making appointments to the lower judiciary. 30 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish AIJS IN THE NEWS  Draft bill to introduce AIJS prepared by the Government, to be introduced to the Union Cabinet after seeking the views of the Higher Judiciary  2019 - The Union Govt spearheaded a consultative process to create an AIJS  Initially, only 4 states and 2 HCs supported the proposal; 8 rejected it, 5 States proposed changes, and 11 are yet to respond  July 2021 - Recently, the Centre took the ordinance route to effect changes in the appointment of members to various tribunals, many were even abolished CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS  Article 233(1)- appointment, promotion, posting of District Judges in any State shall be done by Governor, in consultation with that State’s High Court  42ndConstitutional Amendment, 1976-  Article 312(1) was amended- it empowered the Parliament to make laws for the creation of one or more AIS, common to both Union & States  Article 312(3) places a restriction that such a service shall not include a post inferior to that of a district judge  A significant change was also brought about in the Seventh Schedule- Entry 3 of List II (State list) in its entirety was placed at Entry 11A in List III (Concurrent List- where the Union Law prevails over the State law, generally) {“Administration of Justice; constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts”} ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR  It could be an ideal solution for equal representation of marginalised and deprived sections of the society.  Most States already have a reservation policy in place.  TN provides a roster-based policy of 69%, of which 30% are for women.  States like UP can immensely benefit from the AIJS - there is merely 20% reservation for women.  Efficiency and efficacy of judiciary would be increased.  Transparent and efficient method of recruitment would be followed. 31 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  The issue of pendency and issue of delay of cases would be solved to a great extent.  Corruption, nepotism etc. would be strongly dealt with.  Best legal talent across the country would be selected on the basis of merit.  Better qualified judges in the lower judiciary would translate into more experienced judges in the higher judiciary.  Public faith in the judiciary would be restored.  Favoured by various eminent Bodies- Chief Justices’ Conference, Law Commissions  Supreme Court: ➤ Judgements in favour of AIJS- All-India Judges Case of 1992, All India Judges Association vs. UoI of 2002. ➤ The Court accepted most recommendations of the Shetty Commission and directed the government accordingly. ARGUMENTS AGAINST  Article 233 vs. 312- What was initially, essentially intended to be the prerogative of the State will now be that of the Union. When such fundamental powers of the States get curbed, it affects the basic principle of federalism and is against the basic structure doctrine.  May lead to conflict between Centre & State as the power to recruit judicial officers so far rests with the states- it would take away the powers of the States and HCs to appoint and administer subordinate judges.  Issue of differences in local laws of each state.  Local languages and dialects would pose problems in a hyper technical field such as law.  Legal Education in India is mismanaged. Except for a few well reputed law schools across the country, legal education is not prioritized.  It will be difficult for the less privileged to enter the profession.  Currently, the judges of subordinate courts are appointed by the governor in consultation with the High Court which will not be so if AIJS is implemented. This may be construed as a violation of the Independence of Judiciary as some other body will have a control in appointments.  There is no substantial improvement in the existing efficacy of the procedure for filling the vacancy in the judiciary. 32 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish CONCLUSION  Although AIJS proposes to solve the problem of judicial vacancies, it would be crucial to first conduct a detailed investigation into the reasons for judicial vacancies in poorly performing states so as to structure AIJS in a manner to solve the inherent issues.  Moreover, after the selection of candidates, a Judicial service officer can be provided sufficient training to handle the job, similar to the training imparted to candidates of IAS, IPS, IFS and other civil services, in order to resolve state-specific issues. A meritocratic judiciary is the need of the hour which is possible with a competitive recruitment process. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the AIJS would depend on its potential to efficiently address existing issues and impartiality in its implementation.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
