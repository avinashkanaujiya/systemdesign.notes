Elucidate. 1- What is SHG-SBLP? Short note on it being India’s own innovation 2- Features of the Program that are meant to benefit poverty-stricken and women 3- Effectiveness of these features and provisions 4- Cite examples & suitably conclude INTRODUCTION ➢ Definition and Features: SHG is a voluntary group of 10-20 people having similar socio-economic background in small contiguous area who aspire to improve their living standards. ➢ They operate on the principles of self-help, solidarity and mutual interest. ➢ They can serve many different purposes depending on the situation and the need. ➢ They collectively manage their savings and credit needs. ➢ Each group has a constitution or list of rules, created and accepted by the members themselves. ➢ Functions: ➢ Initiate and maintain savings within the group. ➢ Lending loans to the members ➢ Solving common problems ➢ SHGs must work on getting a collective guarantee system so that they can avail loans from official sources ➢ Prevent exploitation of or discrimination against member groups ➢ Different from traditional lending: ➢ Acceptance of these informal groups both for accepting deposits and credit delivery. ➢ Lending without specification of purpose, activity or project. ➢ All loans are collateral free. SHGs Three Stages of Evolution: ➢ Formation of group ➢ Funding or Formation of Capital ➢ Development of required skills to boost income generation for the group SHG and Bank Linkage Models: ➢ The Self Help Group – Bank Linkage Programme is the largest microfinance programme in the world, with a total membership of around 10 million groups (covering nearly 120 million households) across India. ➢ As of March 31, 2019, it has extended collateral-free loans of over 870 billion rupees to more than 5 million SHGs. ➢ There are 3 kinds of SHGs on the basis of the nature of Bank-SHG Linkage: ➢ Banks, themselves, form and finance the SHGs. ➢ SHGs are formed by NGOs, government and other agencies but financed by banks. ➢ Banks finance SHGs with NGOs and other agencies as financial intermediaries. ➢ They facilitate empowerment by building social capital among the poor, especially women and the disabled. ➢ By facilitating access to credit and financial services for the poor, SHGs play a critical role in poverty alleviation and financial inclusion. ➢ They also provide the marginalized sections an opportunity to improve their economic situation and become visible members of society. ➢ SHGs help people earn alternate livelihood by providing vocational training, and also help improve their existing source of livelihood by offering tools, training, etc. They also help ease the dependency on agriculture. ➢ Financial independence through self-employment results in improved literacy levels, especially banking literacy. SIGNIFICANCE SHGs FRAMEWORK FOR PROMOTION OF SHG ➢ NABARD, through its’ Micro Credit Innovations Department has continued its role as the facilitator and mentor of microfinance initiatives in the country. ➢ The NABARD and the RBI provide guidelines for basic requisites to form a “self-help” group and specifications about the loan requirements. ➢ In 2000, the central government included micro-credit/ rural Credit in the list of permitted Non Banking Financial Company (NBFC) activities for being considered for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)/ Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCB)/ Non-Resident Indian (NRI) investment to encourage foreign participation in micro credit projects. ➢ Since the efficiency and survival of SHGs depends on transparent transactions especially on behalf of the banks, NABARD introduced the Banking Ombudsman Scheme in 2006 to address grievances of borrowers. ➢ Other actors: ➢ Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) - a statutory body –acts as the Principal Financial Institution ➢ The Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK) is an autonomous statutory society under the Ministry of Women and Child Development which works for socio-economic empowerment of women. ➢ The NGO sector has played a prominent role of working as a Self Help Group Promoting Institution (SHPI) by organizing, nurturing and enabling credit linkage of SHGs with banks. ➢ NABARD also co-opted other organizations such as SHPIs including the rural financial institutions (RRBs, DCCBs, PACS), Farmers’ Clubs (FCs), SHG Federations, Individual Rural Volunteers (IRVs) etc. These stakeholders were encouraged to take up promotion of SHGs by way of promotional grant assistance from NABARD. SHGs Rangarajan Committee Report, 2008 - Financial Inclusion ➢ The report defines financial inclusion as “a process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an affordable cost.” ➢ It highlighted four major reasons for lack of financial inclusion in India: ➢ Inability to give collateral security ➢ Weak credit absorption capacity ➢ Insufficient reach of institutions ➢ Weak community network ➢ In India, the primary responsibility of ensuring financial inclusion lies with the commercial banks subject to guidelines of the RBI. ➢ Owing to the large size and diversity of population, commercial banks take assistance of various social and financial entities like cooperative banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), self-help groups (SHGs), and other non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). SHGs ➢ Lack of financial literacy among members of SHGs, most of whom are women from poor households. This makes management of micro enterprises difficult. Financial investment and management also suffer as a result. ➢ Ignorance of members/participants about the facilities available to them. ➢ Lack of proper training to members regarding product selection, quality of products, production techniques, managerial ability, packing, and other technical knowledge leads to no competitive advantage. ➢ Due to the small scale of enterprise, procuring raw materials in small quantities at affordable prices becomes a challenge. There is a lack of channels with big suppliers, as well as of proper storage facilities. ➢ Marketing of products created by SHGs is a bug hurdle to their prosperity. Various challenges include: ➢ Fewer orders ➢ Lack of linkages with marketing agencies ➢ Inadequate sales promotion ➢ Issues of quality with products due to usage of traditional technology ➢ No permanent market for SHG-based products. ➢ Competition from the major players ➢ SHG products often result in low margins of profit for the members. ➢ SHGs, especially those of women lack stability and unity, due to movement of women with their families, as well as due to interpersonal issues in the group. ➢ Financial assistance provided to SHGs is often found to be inadequate and unable to meet the group’s requirements. CHALLENGES SHGs ➢ The approach to financing of SHGs from the government’s end should be that of a facilitator rather than regulator. ➢ The state should however, put in place a mechanism to monitor SHGs and their activities in different states. ➢ The attitude of government officials towards SHG members seeking loans should reflect respect, cooperation and coordination. ➢ Efforts should be made to design new and updated financial products for the SHGs. ➢ Issues arising out of variation in location of SHG group and individual bank accounts should be addressed by the NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India). ➢ The spectrum of services provided on the Bank Correspondent (Bank Sakhi) platform for financial inclusion should be expanded. ➢ The government must invest in literacy of the poor – digital, financial and digital-financial. ➢ Entrepreneurship development which involves enhancing entrepreneurial skills and knowledge through structured training and institution building programmes should be a priority effort for SHG members. ➢ Innovation should also be encouraged in the functioning of SHGs. ➢ The importance of understanding environmental, social and localized issues in promoting sustainable SHGs should be acknowledged and promoted. ➢ Focus on expansion of SHGs into remote credit-deficient areas of the country. ➢ Use technology and communication advances to expand the financial infrastructure in remote regions of states. ➢ Due to increasing urbanization and the number of urban poor, there is a need to develop and strengthen the SHG network in urban areas. RECOMMENDATIONS SHGs ➢ Self-help groups are well-suited to play a critical role in rebuilding the social and economic order damaged by COVID-19. They already serve as community resources in health, farming and nutrition programmes, and they have generated enormous social capital which can be leveraged to design effective responses to the pandemic. ➢ According to the ministry of rural development, more than 132 lakh masks were produced by 14,522 SHGs involving 65,936 members in 399 districts, spread across 24 states of India, in just a period of 15 days from March 15 to March 30, 2020. ➢ Women SHG members, who also work as banking correspondents, known as ‘Bank Sakhis’, have continued to provide doorstep banking services to remote areas. They are distributing pensions as well as enabling the most vulnerable to access credits into their accounts through direct benefit transfers (DBT). ➢ In Kerala, an SHG named Kudumbashree is helping dispel fake news through its network of WhatsApp groups with more than 100,000 women as members. These platforms are specifically leveraged to disseminate urgent and authentic information regarding the pandemic. It is also delivering free ration and grocery kits in the remote tribal hamlets in the district and is running about 1,300 kitchens around the state ➢ The Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal (MAVIM) and the numerous women SHGs operating under it played a crucial role in combating the socio-economic impact of the pandemic in rural Maharashtra. These women even contributed approximately Rs. 11 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund through a MAVIM-driven donation campaign. SHGs & Covid-19 SHGs ➢ In Jharkhand, SHG women use the Aajeevika Farm Fresh mobile app to sell vegetables, ensuring that social distancing guidelines are not flouted. They also use their networks to identify vulnerable households, flagging to the administration the pockets in need of food. ➢ A Women-led SHG in Orissa has set up kitchens in 5,247 gram panchayats and 108 urban local bodies. ➢ Prerna, an SHG in Uttar Pradesh, has attempted in communicating messages on social distancing by street art and wall paintings. ➢ They have also faced some challenges in this period: ➢ Due to scarcity of resources, many NGOs are unable to provide capacity-building support to SHGs. ➢ Lack of transport and marketing facilities, delays in procuring loans etc. are affecting income. ➢ Future challenges include defaulting on loans taken by banks and a possibility of group dissolution due to reduction in income and viable market linkages. ➢ Government responded with announcing doubling collateral free loans to women Self Help Groups (SHGs) from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. This is expected to help 63 lakh SHGs covering 7 crore families. ➢ Post lockdown, there is an imperative need for economic revival and reconstruction. More SHG loans should be sanctioned and enhanced in order to facilitate spending or investment. SHGs & Covid-19 (contd.) SHGs How is micro-finance and the economy of ‘thrift’ helping income of rural India: ➢ The SHG-Bank Linkage programme is the largest microfinance programme in the world (covers 120mn households, 870bn rupees collateral free loan to more than 5mn SHGs) ➢ NABARD’s MicroCredit Innovation Dept ➢ 2000- microfinance NBFC could attract FDI/NRI investment ➢ NABARD’s Banking Ombudsman- grievance redressal ➢ Others: SIDBI, RMK, RRBs, PACS Women in SHGs: ➢ Over 90% of all SHGs are composed of women ➢ Café Kudumbashree (Kerala), Maize producer company (Bihar), Shaurya Dals (MP), MYRADA (Mysore), SEWA of Ela Bhatt ➢ These groups act as catalyst for their social and economic empowerment ➢ Higher income = food security = nutrition for entire family ➢ Enterprising women can reap dividends by investing in small businesses Introduction: voluntary group, similar socio-economic background in, aspire to improve their living standards Functions: financial access and inclusion, solving common problems, preventing discrimination & exploitation Microfinance: granting loans to impoverished borrowers, to become self-employed; many times, without collateral. Idea is to give them the initial boost required to gain entry into an industry. SHGs have proven to be helpful on this front. To sum up, SHGs ➢ What are NGOs? ➢ The World Bank defines NGOs as private organizations that pursue activities to relieve suffering, promote the interests of the poor, protect the environment, provide basic social services, or undertake community development. ➢ NGOs are legally constituted organizations which operate independently from the Government and are generally considered to be nonstate, nonprofit oriented groups who pursue purposes of public interest. ➢ India vs Rest of world: According to the reports of the Central Bureau of Investigation, India has one NGO for every 600 people.

The step was taken to ensure only one custodian monitors flow of foreign funds to these organisations. ➢ For example, International donors such as the Ford Foundation, the U.K.’s Department for International Development etc are registered under FEMA but not the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) 2010. This makes it difficult to monitor the flow of funds effectively. ➢ A transaction under FEMA is called a fee or a salary while the same under FCRA is called a grant or a contribution. Non-State Actors Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 2010 ➢ Purpose- ➢ Regulates the foreign funding of voluntary organizations in India ➢ Ensures that the recipients of foreign contributions adhere to the stated purpose for which such contribution has been obtained ➢ Under the Act, organisations are required to register themselves every five years ➢ Implemented by- Ministry of Home Affairs ➢ Who can accept foreign contributions? ➢ Organizations working for definite cultural, social, economic, educational or religious programs, if and only if they are ➢ Registered with the Home Ministry ➢ Maintaining a separate account listing the donations received from foreigners, getting it audited by a Chartered Accountant and submitting it to the Home Ministry, every year ➢ Who is debarred from accepting foreign contributions? ➢ A candidate contesting an election ➢ Cartoonist, editor, publishers of a registered newspaper ➢ Judge ➢ Government servants or employee of any corporation ➢ Member of any legislature ➢ Political parties Non-State Actors ➢ Aim: to enhance the transparency and accountability in the matter of foreign funds inflow and utilisation. ➢ There is now a capping of the administrative expenses of NGOs at 20% of their foreign donations- only 20% of the foreign funds can be used for administrative purposes while the limit was 50% in FCRA 2010. ➢ The new amendment requires them to have a State Bank of India account at a Delhi Branch. ➢ It also prohibits the transfer of grants received under FCRA to any other outfit. ➢ It also gives sweeping powers to the Ministry of Home Affairs to cancel the FCRA certificate of an NGO. ➢ Makes Aadhaar mandatory for persons who control recipient organizations. ➢ Prohibits \"public servant\" from receiving foreign contributions. Proposed Amendments to FCRA Non-State Actors Positive impacts Negative impacts ➢ With increased accountability, NGOs indulging in dubious activities will be controlled better ➢ This amendment appears to be preventive in nature and seems to enable the Government to prevent illegal receipt and utilisation of foreign contributions ➢ It provides flexibility to the recipient to also open another FCRA Account in any of the scheduled banks in India for the purpose of keeping or utilising the foreign contribution which has been received from its \"FCRA Account\" in the branch of State Bank of India at New Delhi ➢ The misuse of funds could be checked ➢ With increased accountability, NGOs indulging in dubious activities will be controlled better ➢ This amendment appears to be preventive in nature and seems to enable the Government to prevent illegal receipt and utilisation of foreign contributions ➢ It provides flexibility to the recipient to also open another FCRA Account in any of the scheduled banks in India for the purpose of keeping or utilising the foreign contribution which has been received from its \"FCRA Account\" in the branch of State Bank of India at New Delhi ➢ The misuse of funds could be checked ANALYSIS Non-State Actors Accountability Efficiency Transparency Problems ➢ Accreditation remains a big challenge as it is very difficult to distinguish whether an organization wants to work for the cause or has been set up only for the purpose of receiving government grants ➢ Logistical difficulties and hurdles could create confusion as there are two separate Ministries overlooking the functioning of NGOs ➢ Misappropriation of funds ➢ CBI records filed in the Supreme Court show that only 10% of the total registered NGOs under the Societies Registration Act file annual financial statements ➢ FCRA mentions restrictions can be imposed if it \"public Solutions ➢ A National Accreditation Council consisting of academicians, activists, retired bureaucrats should be made to ensure compliance by NGOs ➢ Avoid tussle between Home Ministry and Finance Ministry by bringing the regulation of NGOs under one head. ➢ Annual audits by a third independent party to keep a check on financial activities ➢ FCRA mentions \"public interest\" Conclusion- A democratic state needs a democratic civil society and a democratic civil society also needs a democratic state. They must mutually reinforce each other. SECTOR REVIEW Non-State Actors ➢ Represents socio-economic and political interests of a particular section in political system. e.g. farmers, industrial workers etc. ➢ Organized on the basis of common goals and share similar values. ➢ Seek support of party leaders, legislators and bureaucracy in vigorous pursuit of their goals. ➢ Exert pressure on government in order to obtain laws and administrative measures in favor of their specific interests. ➢ Termed as “anonymous empire”.

NEP,2020 CIVIL SERVICES: HISTORY & EVOLUTION ➢ Lord Cornwallis- Father of Civil Services in India ➢ The Civil Services Examination was first conducted as an open competitive examination in the year 1855, in London. At that time, it was called the Indian Covenant Civil Service (ICCS) Examination and was conducted by the British Civil Services Commission. ➢ In 1926, the Public Service Commission (India) was set up which began to conduct the Indian Civil Service (ICS) Examination in India on behalf of the British Civil Services Commission. Under the Government of India Act 1935, Federal Public Service Commission was set up. ➢ After 1943, recruitment to the Indian Civil Service, the Indian Police Service, the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and the allied services were suspended upto 1946. ➢ With the promulgation of the new Constitution for independent India on January 26, 1950, the Federal Public Service Commission was accorded Constitutional status as an autonomous entity under Article 315 and given the title Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). ➢ An AIS can be created by Parliament under Art 312 on the basis of a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha. Civil Services CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO CIVIL SERVANTS ➢ The Doctrine of Pleasure has been embodied in Art 310, subject to provisions of Art 311 ➢ Art 310: All persons (members of defense/ civil service/ AIS) hold office during pleasure of President ➢ Restrictions: Certain constitutional offices have been excluded from the subject of this doctrine like SC/HC Judges, CAG, CEC, UPSC Chairman ➢ Safeguards under Art 311: There shall be no removal by subordinate authority, Reasonable opportunity to defend himself ➢ Principles of Natural Justice: no bias, cant be Judge of her own case, both parties to be heard, notice to be given ➢ Exceptions to PNJ: ➢ Person dismissed/ reduced/ removed in rank on account of misconduct that has led to conviction ➢ Where it is impracticable to give civil servant such an opportunity ➢ If President/Governor is satisfied that in the interest of the Security of the State, it is expedient to hold such an inquiry Civil Services The first major review of the civil services examination undertaken by Kothari Committee in 1974-77 and followed by the second review by Satish Chandra 1988- 89. The Third Review Committee report, under the chairpersonship of YK Alagh was presented in 2001. The PC Hota Committee in its report in 2004 also made recommendations regarding selection and examination structure. The recommendations of the review committees have not been accepted in totality and in only in parts. The importance of the Civil Service to governance stems from the following: ➢ Service presence throughout the country and its strong binding character ➢ Administrative and managerial capacity of the services ➢ Effective policy-making and regulation ➢ Effective coordination between institutions of governance ➢ Leadership at different levels of administration. ➢ Service delivery at the cutting edge level ➢ Provide ‘continuity and change’ to the administration IMPORTANCE REVIEW COMMITTEES Civil Services CHALLENGES The ailments afflicting Indian civil services are: ➢ Lack of professionalism and poor capacity building ➢ Inefficient incentive systems that do not appreciate upright and outstanding civil servants ➢ Outmoded rules and procedure that restrict efficiency ➢ Systemic inconsistencies in promotion and embankment ➢ Lack of transparency and accountability procedures ➢ Arbitrary and whimsical transfers ➢ Political interference and administrative acquiescence ➢ Gradual erosion of ethics and values It is well recognized that Civil Services Reforms is not only necessary but also inevitable. It has as much value in governance as in Socio-Economic development. ISSUES The reform mandate may throw in the following challenges, which could be countered using the following: ➢ Political support and will ➢ Management capacity to implement reforms ➢ Nurturing support from civil servants themselves ➢ Safety nets for people adversely affected ➢ Developing communication between stakeholders Civil Services Interlinkage between robust bureaucracy & economic growth ➢ Bureaucracy: the body of nonelected officials involved in public administration ➢ Economic growth: quantitative expansion of the national economy over time, either through resource accumulation or through improvements in productivity, typically measured through the growth of the gross domestic product ➢ Governmental economic policy is, without doubt, one of the major factors influencing economic growth. However, the growth performance depends not only on what policy measures the government decides to implement but also on how these policies are implemented – and therefore, is influenced by the behavior of the bureaucracy. Inefficient and poorly functioning bureaucracy can undermine even the most insightful and most visionary policy. ➢ Instances of policy paralysis IN NEWS- Recently, the Bhilwara model (in Rajasthan) has become a successful example for the world to emulate in tackling the Covid-19 crisis because of the efforts of local bureaucracy. This earmarks the importance of the role of civil services in containing the spread of disease at community level. Civil Services MAJOR COMPONENTS Civil Services E-initiatives: ➢ Robust Vigilant Mechanism: Strengthen institutional mechanisms for prevention and detection of corruption. Thus, there is a need to review existing vigilance mechanisms. ➢ There is a need to strengthen implementation of a Centralized Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System (CPGRAMs). ➢ Implementation of e-Office : Implementation of e-Office may be expedited in all ministries/ departments; all states/UTs may also be encouraged to adopt it. ➢ Prompt delivery of services: Every department should seek to simplify their processes to cut administrative delays and ensure participatory feedback mechanisms for efficient service delivery. IN NEWS: Recently, eight professionals were recruited for joint secretary-level positions in various ministries under the lateral entry scheme. Lateral entry means when personnel from the private sector are selected to an administrative post of the government despite them not being selected in or being part of a bureaucratic setup. Lateral entry is needed because contemporary times require highly skilled and motivated individuals at the helm of administrative affairs, without which public service delivery mechanisms do not work smoothly. However, the success of lateral entry hinges entirely on how it is designed. Civil Services Mission Karmayogi ➢ It is an upskilling initiative for government officials that aims to fix and galvanize India’s administration. ➢ As envisaged, the Karmayogi training mechanism will cover an estimated 4.6 million officials at all levels. ➢ Due to the scale of the exercise elaborate multi-tier command structure is expected to be put in place for it. ➢ At its apex would be a Human Resource Council, headed by the Prime Minister. ➢ Human Resource Council shall approve and monitor various skill-enhancing programmes as well as review the performance of employees routinely. Apex bodies under the mission ➢ The Prime Minister’s Public Human Resource Council will be set up as the apex body to direct the reforms. ➢ There will be an autonomous Capacity Building Commission to be established to manage the reformed system and harmonize training standards across the country so that there is a common understanding of India’s aspirations and development goals. ➢ A wholly government-owned, not-for- profit special purpose vehicle will be set up to own and operate the digital platform and its content. Civil Services Challenges Solutions Rule-book bureaucracy Focus should be role- rather than rule-specific Structural issues- Generalist officers Specialist officers for domain knowledge at policy level Political interference Accountability through participatory & representative decision-making Allegations of being status quoist Role and responsibility clarity Recruitment: rationalization & harmonization of services Ethical underpinning through Code of Ethics Online SPARROW to be instituted in all cares (for continuous evaluation) Strengthen implementation of CPGRAMs In short, Civil Services According to the World Bank, “E-Governance refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies (such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) that have the ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. These technologies can serve a variety of different ends: ➢ better delivery of government services to citizens ➢ improved interactions with business and industry ➢ citizen empowerment through access to information ➢ or more efficient government management The resulting benefits can be less corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience, revenue growth, and/or cost reductions.” According to UNESCO, “e-Governance may be understood as the performance of governance via the electronic medium in order to facilitate an efficient, speedy and transparent process of disseminating information to the public, and other agencies, and for performing government administration activities.” What is E-governance? E-Governance ➢ Fast, Convenient and Cost Effective Service Delivery: With the advent of e-Service delivery, the government can provide information and services at lesser costs, in reduced time and with greater convenience. ➢ Transparency, and Reduced Corruption: Dissemination of information through ICT increases transparency, ensures accountability and prevents corruption. An increased use of computers and web based services improves the awareness levels of citizens about their rights and powers. It helps to reduce the discretionary powers of government officials and curtail corruption. ➢ Expanded Reach of Governance: Expansion of telephone network, rapid strides in mobile telephony, spread of internet and strengthening of other communications infrastructure would facilitate delivery of a number of public services. ➢ Empowering people through information: Increased accessibility to information has empowered the citizens and has enhanced their participation. With easy access to the government services, the faith of the citizens in the government increases and they come forward to share their views and feedback. ➢ Improve interface with Business and Industry: Industrial development in India has been hampered in the past with complex procedures and bureaucratic delays. E-governance aims to expedite the various processes important for industrial development. POTENTIAL OF E-GOVERNANCE E-GovernanceE-Governance Government to Citizen (G2C) This model of e-governance refers to the government services which are shared by the citizens. This model strengthens the bond between government and the citizens. Type of services which are provided by this model: ➢ Payment of online bills such as electricity, water, telephone bills etc. ➢ Online registration of applications ➢ Online copies of land-record ➢ Online filing of complaints ➢ Availability of any kind of online information Government to Government (G2G) This model refers to the services which are shared between the governments. There is a lot of information that needs to be shared between various government agencies, departments and organizations. These types of services or information include: ➢ Government document exchange which includes preparation, approval, distribution, and storage of all governmental documents is also done through e-governance. ➢ Most of the finance and budget work are also done through e-governance. E-Governance Government to Businessmen (G2B) Through this model, the bond between the private sector and government strengthens. The information shared through this model include: ➢ Collection of taxes ➢ Rejection and approval of patents ➢ Payment of all kind of bills and penalty ➢ Sharing of all kind of information, rules and data ➢ Complaints or any kind of dissatisfaction can be expressed Government to Employees (G2E) This model increases the transparency between the government and its employees and thus strengthens their relationship. Information that can be shared by this model are as follows: ➢ All kind of data submission(attendance record, employee record etc.) from various government offices ➢ Employee can file complaints and dissatisfaction ➢ Rules & regulation and information for employees can be shared ➢ Employees can check their payment and working record E-Governance INITIATIVES E-Governance Fourth IR & E-governance ➢ First IR: driven by steam power ➢ Second IR: driven by electric power ➢ Third IR: electronic power ➢ Fourth IR: driven by data and AI Data set: India is undergoing a Digital Revolution ➢ Smartphone penetration- from 19%, in 2016 to estimated 31%, in 2022 ➢ Internet cost- India has the cheapest mobile broadband prices worldwide ➢ Online transactions- UPI transactions more than doubled in a year (2020-2021) E-governance: use of ICT for delivery of government services; G2B, G2C, G2G Government initiative Benefit / Objective Digital India Digital infrastructure as utility to every citizen, Governance & services on demand, Digital empowerment of citizens Bhoomi project (KNT), Lokvani project (UP), Project FRIENDS (Kerala) Digitization of land records, grievance redressal, single window facility to pay taxes, respectively Jeevan Pramaan Aadhaar based biometric authentication system MyGov, Digital Locker System Establishes link between Govt and its citizens E-courts, MCA21, DARPAN Reduced cost, better turnaround time, facilitates real time data of selected projects, respectively Shillong Declaration- IndAE Interoperability & integration among e-govt apps E-GovernanceE-Governance Following are some of the important recommendations of 2nd Administrative Commission on e- governance: ➢ Building a Congenial Environment: Building a congenial environment is a sine-qua-non for successful implementation of e-Governance initiatives. This should be achieved by: ➢ Creating and displaying a will to change within the government ➢ Providing political support at the highest level ➢ Incentivising e-Governance ➢ Creating awareness in the public with a view to generating a demand for change. ➢ Business Process Re-engineering: Governmental forms, processes and structures should be re- designed to make them adaptable to e-Governance, backed by procedural, institutional and legal changes. ➢ Capacity Building and Creating Awareness: Capacity building efforts must attend to both the organizational capacity building as also the professional and skills up gradation of individuals associated with the implementation of e-Governance projects. ➢ Developing Technological Solutions: Develop a national e-Governance ‘enterprise architecture’ framework as has been done in some countries. Recommendations of 2nd ARC on e-governance E-Governance Ease of Governance ➢ The idea of ease of governance was mooted very recently by the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and pensions. ➢ As per this idea, the main aim of e-governance should be ‘ease of governance’ leading to ‘ease of living’ of people. This is essential for the emergence of a ‘New India’. ➢ Ease of Governance essentially means Ease of access to governance where public policies are people centric with empathetic and responsive government mechanism with ear on the ground and connects far more effectively. ➢ One example of such governance is the swift move by the Ministry of aviation to ask airline operators to do away with high cancellation fees on flight booking- Cancellation fees up to Rs. 3000 were quite high and even sometimes, more than actual cost of the ticket.
