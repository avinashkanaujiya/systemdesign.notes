Projects will benefit 9.48 lakh families of 4,036 villages. PM inaugurated integrated e-GramSwaraj & GeM portal. PM handed over 35 lakh Swamitva property cards to beneficiaries. Around 1.25 crore property cards distributed under Swamitva Y ojana Scheme was launched by Prime Minister Modi on 24th April 2020, aim to promote socio-economically empowered, self-reliant rural India. Success of Panchayati Raj Gandhiji’ s dream of Gram Swaraj and Oceanic Circles of Power were realised through the Panchayati Raj System. The PRIs are the local self-governing bodies that ensure the opportunity for people’ s participation and involvement in the formulation and implementation of rural development programmes. The main objective of Panchayat System in India is to strengthen the base of democracy at the grass root level. It was introduced as a real democratic political apparatus which would bring the masses into active political control from below , from the vast majority of the weaker , poor sections of rural India. They play the role of a catalytic agent in integrating development of tribal masses in rural areas. Plan documents of both the central and state governments and various committees have emphasised the importance of these bodies in the polity . Five-year plans have also laid special emphasis on the role of Panchayats in rural developments. Rural Development includes measures to strengthen the democratic structure of society through the PRIs. PRIs have been used to improve the rural infrastructure, income of rural households and delivery systems pertaining to education, health and safety mechanisms. These institutions are to be galvanised to become ef fective instruments of social and economic change at the local level. Reservation for women (33%) has increased their presence in the public life. Failures of democratic decentralisation especially in Panchayats: 2 /3 Overwhelming dependency on government funding: Panchayat’ s own resource base to raise finances is low and the financial resources are tied to certain schemes and initiatives. When Panchayats do not raise resources and instead depend on external funding, people are less likely to enforce social audit and ef ficacy of the schemes. Eg: In case of Urban local bodies, majority of municipalities have not increased property tax since many years and have not leveraged the municipal bonds for betterment of city infrastructure. Creation of Parallel Bodies: Parallel Bodies have usurped the legitimate space of local bodies. For instance, Smart City scheme is being implemented in major cities through Special Purpose V ehicles, squeezing the limited space of urban local governance in municipalities. Lack of adequate Devolution: Many states have not devolved the 3F’ s of function, funds and functionaries, to enable local bodies to discharge their constitutionally stipulated functions. Excessive control by bureaucracy In many Gram Panchayats, Sarpanches have to spend an extra ordinary amount of time visiting block Of ficers for funds and/or technical approval. These interactions with the Block staf f of fice distort the role of Sarpanches as elected representatives. Multiple institutions like parastatals, development authorities, public works departments, and ULBs themselves report to dif ferent departments of the state government and have been entrusted with overlapping responsibilities. Poor Infrastructure: It is found that nearly 25% of Gram Panchayats do not have basic of fice buildings. Capacity building of elected representatives is another hindrance in the grass roots democracy . In case of urban local bodies, Mayor position is merely cermonial. Measures Need to strengthen Panchayats: Central Government has started the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan. The campaign is undertaken under the name of “Sabka Sath, Sabka Gaon, Sabka V ikas”. It aims to draw up Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) in the country and place them on a website where anyone can see the status of the various government’ s flagship schemes. Gram Panchayats have been mandated for the preparation of GPDP for economic development and social justice utilizing the resources available to them. Government of India formulated E-Panchayat Mission Mode Project for e- enablement of all the Panchayats, to make their functioning more ef ficient and transparent. Social Audit: The power of social audit was proven by Jan Sunwai in Rajasthan. T ransparent, third party Social Audit can enable people to hold the representatives accountable. 3 /3 Citizen Participation : In case of Gram Sabhas, their functions and roles must be clearly defined as in the PESA Act, to enable to function ef fectively . Conclusion: The need of the hour is to bring about a holistic change in the lives of people among the villagers by uplifting their socioeconomic and health status through ef fective linkages through community , governmental and other developmental agencies. People’ s demands for the sustainable decentralisation and advocacy should focus on a decentralisation agenda. The framework needs to be evolved to accommodate the demand for decentralisation.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
