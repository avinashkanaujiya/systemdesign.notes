Microplastics: ● These are tiny plastic particles (less than 5 mm long) that result from both commercial product develop- ment (microbeads in personal care products, syn- thetic fibres from clothing, etc) and the breakdown of larger plastics. ● They are found everywhere, from terrestrial ecosys- tems to freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, seas and oceans, even in Antarctica. Threats posed by microplastics: ● Microplastics are not only toxic for the ecosystems but also act as vectors to transport other toxic chem- icals in the aquatic ecosystems. ● As a pollutant, microplastics are a significant envi- ronmental problem and pose risks to marine life, terrestrial organisms and human health. ● As a result, many scientists are using a new histori- cal epoch - Plasticene, due to the global distribution and abundance of microplastics. Factors contributing to microplastic pollution in India: ● Rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and popula- tion growth have led to increased plastic consump- tion and waste generation. ● Inadequate waste management systems, including limited recycling infrastructure and improper dis- posal practices. For example, ○ Municipal areas in India generate 133,760 metric tonnes per day (TPD) of municipal solid waste (MSW). ○ Of which only 91,152 TPD waste is collected and 25,884 TPD treated. ○ Of which only 9,250 TPD plastic waste is re- cycled. ● The vast coastline and numerous rivers make it sus- ceptible to the transport of microplastics from in- land areas to the marine environment. Challenges India is facing: ● Most populous country in the world with a popu- lation of 1.42 billion → Demand for water is rising. ● Access to water plays a critical role in all 17 SDGs either directly or indirectly. ● Misuse, poor management and contamination of freshwater systems have amplified the water stress. www.insightsonindia.com3 ● Thus, achieving SDGs by 2030 is a mammoth task amid microplastic pollution. Some SDGs that have direct and intricate relations with water: ● SDG 2: Zero hunger ● SDG 3: Good health and well-being ● SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation ● SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy ● SDG 14: Life below water ● SDG 15: Life on land Steps taken in India: ● The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules 2021 prohibited single-use plastic items by the end of 2022. ● The permissible thickness of plastic carry bags was increased from 50 to 75 microns and then 120 microns from December 31, 2022. ● Several nonprofits and civil society organisations (Bengaluru-based Saahas) are actively working to tackle the issue through research, advocacy and community engagement. Way ahead: ● Focus on the key targets of SDG 6: ○ Achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. ○ Improve water quality by reducing pollution and increasing water treatment. ○ Increase water-use efficiency in all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater. ○ Implement integrated water resources management to support the sustainable use of water resources. ○ Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. ● India should focus on improving waste management infrastructure, promoting recycling and responsible consump- tion and raising awareness among the public and industries. ● It is essential to implement stricter regulations, enhance monitoring and research on microplastics and promote sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics. Conclusion: It is important to note that managing microplastics is a complex task that requires a comprehensive approach involving government agencies, industries, communities and individuals working together to reduce plastic waste and pro- tect the environment.

About the Manual for DMP: ● Developed by: The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, based on the Advisory issued by the National Disaster Manage- ment Authority (NDMA), under the Disaster Man- agement Act 2005. ● Objective: ○ To ensure safety, uninterrupted supply and minimum loss of Water, Sanitation and Hy- giene (WASH) assets and services involving stakeholders at the national, state, district, and village levels. ○ Enhance WASH resilience to reduce disaster vulnerability. ○ Establish a robust environment, fund and coordination mechanism to achieve the de- sired goals. ○ Develop a plan which caters to disaster pre- paredness, response, recovery, reconstruc- tion, and mitigation. ● The plan includes Gender-based vulnerabilities, and issues concerning SC/ST, elderly, children and people with disabilities. ● The Plan aligns with The two-flagship programmes on WASH implemented by the Department namely the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) and Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G). In case of disaster, 3 kinds of assessment need to be con- ducted: ● Before the disaster: A Hazard-Vulnerability-Capacity mapping to guide the preparedness activities most needed, ● During Response: A Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) which can be completed in a day and point out the immediate needs of the affected population, ● During Recovery and Reconstruction: A detailed Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) which - ○ Highlights the long-term needs of the com- munity and ○ Helps the administration “build back bet- ter” and “update” to mitigate against future disasters. Other Indian efforts towards reducing the risk of disasters: ● G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Working Group: India has established the first G20 Working Group on DRR to elevate DRR as a priority for G20 through its presidency. ● Expanding disaster early warning: During Cyclone Biparjoy, effective systems for end-to-end early warning and action helped achieve zero deaths from the event in India. ● UN Secretary General’s Early Warnings for All Ini- tiative: India is working to realise the goal of the ini- tiative, which seeks to create universal coverage for everyone by the end of 2027. ● Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CRDI): India launched CRDI with the UN in 2019, to spur policy development and capacity support for disaster resilient infrastructure, especially in devel- oping countries. Best practices - Disaster response in Odisha: ● Sneha Abhiyaan: Under this, self-help groups (SHGs) in the village are entrusted with managing cyclone shelters, including the distribution of cooked food. ● Mamta Gruhas: These safe spaces provide compre- hensive care for women, children and other vulnera- ble sections of society. ● Training and capacity building of frontline workers (ASHAs, SHGs): SDRF provides training in first aid, shelter management, rescue operations, govern- ment regulations concerning trafficking and com- pensation norms. Way ahead: ● To build resilience within affected communities, it is essential to focus on long-term rehabilitation. ● The leadership of women collectives plays a vital role in this process. Conclusion: As the world is at the midpoint of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, a re- newed sense of urgency and a people-centred approach can significantly reduce disaster losses by 2030.

His virus level remained undetectable 20 months after discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. •\t However, his cells are still susceptible to HIV, leav- ing the possibility of the virus returning. What is a stem cell transplant? A stem cell transplant (SCT) is a medical procedure in which healthy stem cells are infused into a patient to replace dam- aged or diseased stem cells. Stem cells are special human cells that can replicate and differentiate into various types of cells in the body. The transplant aims to restore the body’s ability to produce healthy blood cells, boost the immune system, and treat certain diseases like leukaemia and lym- phoma. Can SCT be used for treating all HIV patients? Stem cell transplant is unlikely to become a routine treat- ment for HIV due to challenges in finding matching donors and the mutation being mainly found in Caucasians. Stem cell transplantation also comes with risks, such as the risk of patient rejection and the virus finding other ways to infect cells. Why Caucasians are able to recover while other races are not? The recovery of HIV through stem cell transplantation has been more commonly observed in Caucasians because a specific gene mutation known as CCR5 delta 32 is more prevalent in this racial group. People who inherit two copies of this mutation (one from each parent) are naturally resis- tant to certain strains of HIV due to the lack of receptors on their immune cells that the virus uses to enter and infect the cells. Effective antiretroviral therapy remains the primary treat- ment for HIV, suppressing the virus and allowing CD4 im- mune cell count to bounce back. Although it doesn’t remove the virus completely, it reduces viral particles to undetect- able levels and prevents transmission to others. Other patients who have achieved HIV remission through stem cell transplantation include the Berlin patient, the Lon- don patient, and the New York patient. Stem cell therapy using umbilical cord and adult stem cells may make trans- plants possible in people from other races as well. WHO NEW GUIDELINES FOR HIV Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) released new guidance for HIV at the International AIDS Society Con- ference on HIV Science. Key points of the guideline: •\t It emphasizes the critical role of HIV viral suppres- sion and undetectable virus levels in enhancing in- dividual health and preventing transmission of the virus. •\t Countries integrate Mpox (monkeypox) detection, prevention and care with existing and innovative HIV and sexually transmitted infection prevention and control programmes. •\t People living with HIV who achieve an undetectable level of the virus through consistent use of antiret- roviral therapy (ART) do not transmit HIV to their sexual partner(s) and are at low risk of vertically transmitting HIV to their children. CONTROLLED HUMAN INFECTION STUDIES (CHIS) Context: India is taking its first step towards introducing Controlled Human Infection Studies (CHIS), a research mod- el used in other countries for vaccine and treatment devel- opment. What is CHIS? It is a research model used to intentionally expose healthy volunteers to pathogens in a controlled environment to study diseases and develop vaccines and treatments for dis- eases like malaria, typhoid, and dengue. The goal is to gain insights into disease pathogenesis and find efficient and cost-effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases. The issues with CHIS (Controlled Human Infection Studies) include: •\t Ethical Sensitivity: CHIS involves intentionally ex- www.insightsonindia.com8 posing healthy volunteers to pathogens, raising con- cerns about deliberate harm and protecting partici- pants’ rights. •\t Disproportionate Payment: Concerns about induce- ments and potential financial incentives for volun- teers to participate in risky studies. •\t Third-Party Risk: The risk of transmission of the pathogen to individuals outside the study, leading to potential community spread. •\t Research with Vulnerable Participants: Ensuring that vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant wom- en or children, are not exposed to undue risks during CHIS. •\t Technical and Clinical Challenges: Ensuring proper scientific procedures and safety protocols are fol- lowed in the controlled environment. •\t Legal Contentions: Addressing potential legal issues related to participant consent and liability. •\t Socio-Cultural Context: Considering unique so- cio-cultural factors that may impact the acceptabil- ity and feasibility of CHIS in different communities. The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) Bioethics Unit has introduced a consensus policy statement, open for public comment, to address the ethical concerns associated with CHIS. The aim is to conduct research in India while pro- tecting human participants and ensuring ethical principles are upheld. UNIFYING QUANTUM THEORY AND GENERAL RELATIVITY How are scientists trying to unify the two theories? Scientists are researching how atoms falling into a black hole emit radiation and its quantum behaviour, resem- bling Hawking radiation. Their calculations on this radiation, known as “horizon brightened acceleration radiation en- tropy,” reveal insights into the Einstein principle of equiv- alence. This work aims to unify quantum theory and general relativ- ity into a single theory called “quantum gravity,” enhancing our understanding of the universe from tiny particles to im- mense galaxies. LUDWIGIA PERUVIANA Context: The invasive weed Ludwigia peruviana is threaten- ing elephant habitats and foraging areas in Valparai, Tamil Nadu. About Ludwigia Peruviana: The Ludwigia peruviana, an aquatic plant with pale yel- lowish flowers, is causing significant challenges in various swampy areas worldwide. Originally introduced as an orna- mental plant for its tiny yellow flowers in Tamil Nadu, it now grows rapidly, particularly in wetlands, due to the pre-mon- soon temperature and monsoon rains. This fast growth is disrupting the balance of perennial foraging grounds, hin- dering the growth of grass and native plants that elephants and other animals such as Gaur, rely on for food. •\t Origin: It is popularly called primrose willow, it is a native of Central and South America. •\t It is among the 22 priority invasive plants in Tamil Nadu. •\t It has infested the majority of the hill station’s swamps, locally known as vayals . www.insightsonindia.com9 Mapping GODDA (JHARKHAND) Bangladesh will get power supply from the 1600 MW Ultra Super-Critical Thermal Power Plant (USCTPP) at Godda, Jharkhand.
