What is palliative care? ● Palliative care is the branch of medicine focusing on improving the quality of life and preventing suf- fering among those with life-limiting illnesses like heart failure, kidney failure, certain neurological dis- eases, cancer, etc. ● Often misinterpreted as end-of-life care, it focuses on the person as a whole, not just the disease. Objectives of palliative care: ● To identify patients at risk of over-medicalisation at the expense of quality of life and financial burden on the family. ● To address the physical, psychological, spiritual, and social domains of the health of people suffering from life-limiting diseases. ● It also includes bereavement/grieving support for the caregivers in case of the death of the patient. How many need palliative care in India? ● India has experienced a steep rise in the burden of lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases. ● Nearly 1.4 million people are diagnosed with can- cer in India every year while diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory diseases are also on the rise. ● Estimated 7-10 million people need palliative care sooner or later in the disease trajectory. Status of palliative care in India: ●\t Skewed\t availability\t of\t palliative\t care\t services → largely been available at tertiary healthcare facilities in urban areas → only to 1-2% of those who require it in the country. ● 55 million people in India are pushed below the poverty line every year due to health-related expen- ditures (over-medicalisation plays a significant role). Steps taken: ● A three-tier health system, multiple national health programmes and schemes (like the Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance Scheme). ● National Programme for Palliative Care (NPPC): It was announced in 2012, however, the lack of a ded- icated budget has prevented the implementation of the programme since its inception. ● National Programme for Health Care for the Elder- ly: Launched in 2010, to provide accessible, afford- www.insightsonindia.com3 able, and high-quality long-term, comprehensive and dedicated care services to an Ageing population. ● Some best practices: NGOs like Pallium India, Karunashraya, and CanSupport are trying to fill the gap in palliative care in India. ○ However, NGOs have limitations on how much they can spend and that doesn’t com- pare in any way with how much the govern- ment can spend. ● National Programme for Prevention & Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD): ○ Launched in 2010 to counter the rising bur- den of noncommunicable diseases in the country. ○ The programme envisaged the provision of promotive, preventive, and curative care from primary to tertiary institutes. ○ In order to strengthen palliative care, the GoI revised the operational guidelines of NP-NCD. What are the gaps in the guidelines? ● Mention palliative care in synonymy with cancer only: However, the need for palliative care was high- er for non-cancer illnesses. ○ Cancer is just one of 20 common health con- ditions that require palliative care. ● No mention of home-based palliative care services: Since most patients who need palliative care are suf- fering from debilitating diseases, home-based care forms the ideal mode of healthcare delivery. ○ However, palliative care service delivery starts only from the district hospital in the revised guidelines. ● No mention of paediatric palliative care: The guide- lines skipped an opportunity to bring focus on chil- dren suffering from chronic diseases. ● Linking of 11 programmes (including NPPC) to pro- mote convergence: The mechanisms of the linkage with a programme (NPPC) that has not yet been fully implemented are unclear. Way ahead: ● Broaden the sphere of palliative care to include multiple diseases and services. ● Palliative care needs to be integrated into health systems at all levels. ● Include palliative care along with curative treat- ment. ● Increased focus should be given to the impact as- sessment of palliative care programmes. Conclusion: It is high time for India to realise the ongoing pandemic of non-communicable diseases and strengthen its palliative care services.

Why are CO2 emissions the problem? ● As we continue to burn fossil fuels and destroy nat- ural habitats, CO2 continues to accumulate in the atmosphere. ● Heat reflected by the earth doesn’t all escape to space, some of it is trapped by atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs. ● This leads to warmer land and oceans, accelerating ice melt, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events and triggers food shortages, disease, loss of lives and property, forced migrations, etc. A linear model of economy The alternative - the circu- lar model The required natural re- sources from the ground are taken to make products out of them, used and then thrown away at the end of their lives. Take, make, use, recycle, reuse. Here, the product life is extended and the waste created is used as a resource to recreate similar or other products. This model is not sustain- able Sustainable. This way, de- pendence on natural re- sources can go down with- out compromising comforts or economic growth. The circular economy for carbon dioxide (CO2): Meaning: ● A circular carbon economy is a framework for man- aging and reducing emissions. ● It is a closed-loop system involving 4Rs: reduce, re- use, recycle, and remove. www.insightsonindia.com4 Need for the circular economy for CO2: ● To stop emitting ‘new’ CO2 as well as remove some of the CO2 piled up in the atmosphere. ○ For the latter, carbon capture and utilisa- tion techniques are useful. ○ These are technologies developed to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, which can be used to make items such as carbonated drinks, dry ice, and fire retardants, and to synthesise clean high-efficiency fuel. ● The energy transition to renewables is a slow pro- cess. The shift to electric vehicles, and decarbonisa- tion (of steel, cement, and plastics manufacturing) will take time. Challenges towards creating a circular economy for carbon: ● Approaches and methods are not well developed: Some of these are already commercial but only at a small scale, while others are still being prototyped and tested. ● The energy required to capture and repurpose the CO2: More energy is required to capture CO2 and convert it into a litre of fuel than the energy that this new litre of fuel will produce. ● The energy we use to capture and repurpose CO2 should be clean energy. Way ahead: ● Net-zero CO2 additions can be achieved by using the stock of atmospheric CO2 over and over again. ● The rest of captured CO2 can be stored in the ground and lie there for a long period of time. Conclusion: Reducing real and perceived hurdles to Carbon, Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) by formulating comprehensive strategies is essential for a swift, secure, and sustainable recovery that meets affordable energy access and climate goals. Insta Links: Mains Links: GS Paper 3 THE PROBLEM WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES Syllabus: Environment/ Science and Technology - De- velopments and their Applications and Effects in Ev- eryday Life Source: IE Context: The government of India is solely promoting bat- tery electric vehicles (BEVs), regardless of the problems as- sociated with them. Types of EVs: Types Description Examples Hybrid EVs (HEVs) These are the vehicles which combine a conven- tional internal combus- tion engine (ICE) system with an electric propul- sion system → hybrid drivetrain that substan- tially lowers fuel usage. Toyota Hyryder in India Plug-in h ybr id v ehic le s (PHEVs) A hybrid drivetrain uses both an ICE and electric power for motive pow- er, backed by recharge- able batteries that can be plugged into a power source. Chevrolet Volt BEVs They run on a fully elec- tric drivetrain powered by rechargeable batter- ies. They have no ICE or fuel tank. Tata Nexon in India Fuel cell v ehic le s (FCVs) They combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, which runs the motor, and the only residue of the chemical process is water. Honda’s Clarity Initiatives for Promoting EVs in India: ● National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMPP) ● The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme www.insightsonindia.com5 ● Production-linked incentive (PLI) Scheme - National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Bat- tery Storage ● Go Electric Campaign Why are these initiatives launched? To cut emissions and reduce costly fuel imports. Impact of these initiatives: ● EV sales have increased by more than 2,218% in the last 3 years. ○ Overall sales of EVs in India crossed the 1 million milestone (over 60% of these are two-wheelers) for the first time in 2022-23. However, the total EV sales are ~5% current- ly. ○ The government target for EV sales is 30% for private cars, 70% for commercial vehi- cles and 80% for two and three-wheelers by 2030. ● Other alternatives are ignored: Currently, the Indian government offers clear tax advantages/incentives primarily for one type of vehicle - BEVs - with almost all other vehicle technologies grouped together un- der the heavy tax bracket. Issues with BEVs: ● State subsidies cornered by few: The problem is that much of the subsidy or tax breaks end up in the hands of the middle or upper middle class- es, who are typically the buyers of battery electric four-wheelers. ● Poor charging network: Only about 2,000 public charging stations are currently operational across the country. ● Different charging demands: For example, e-2W and 3W models in India are suited to slow charging, unlike cars and buses. ● Non-renewable electricity source: In India, the grid is still fed largely by coal-fired thermal plants. ● Import dependence: India is almost entirely de- pendent on imports from a small pool of countries (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Australia and China) to ca- ter to its demand for Li for the production of Li-ion batteries. Way ahead: ● Investing in charging infrastructure is 4-7 times more effective in EV adoption than providing up- front purchase subsidies (WB). ● Adopting a battery-swapping mechanism as an al- ternative for cases where fast charging is required. ● Exploring other alternatives: ○ Hybrids, ○ Flexible/flex fuel vehicle has an ICE, but un- like a regular petrol or diesel vehicle, it can run on more than one type of fuel or even a mixture of fuels such as petrol and ethanol. ○ Hydrogen FCVs are practically zero emission. ○ German manufacturer Porsche is develop- ing a synthetic fuel that can make an ICE as clean as an EV. GS3 CHANDRAYAAN-3 Syllabus: Science and Technology: Space Context: Chandrayaan-3 is India’s upcoming lunar mission, which aims to be the world’s first mission to soft-land near the lunar south pole. What is Chandrayaan-3 Mission? Chandrayaan-3 is India’s third moon mission and is a fol- low-up of Chandrayaan-2 (2019) which aimed to land a rover on the lunar South Pole. The Mission will have three major modules- the •\t Propulsion module ( will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit) •\t Lander module (capability to soft land and deploy Rover) •\t Rover (will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface) Challenges of landing on the South Pole: Previous spacecraft have mostly landed near the equatorial region of the Moon, a few degrees latitude north or south of the lunar equator. Landing near the equator is easier and safer due to the hospitable terrain, smooth surface, ab- sence of steep slopes, and ample sunlight for solar-powered instruments. The lunar south pole, on the other hand, presents a chal- lenging terrain with extreme temperatures and areas that are in permanent shadow, receiving no sunlight. Why ISRO wants to explore the Moon’s south pole? •\t Water Resources: The south pole region is believed to have water molecules in substantial amounts, possibly trapped as ice in the permanently shad- owed craters. o Exploring and confirming the presence of water is essential for future human mis- sions and the potential utilization of lunar resources. •\t Scientific Discoveries: The extreme environment and the presence of permanently shadowed regions provide a preserved record of the Moon’s history and the early Solar System. •\t Clues to Earth’s History: The Moon is thought to have formed from debris generated by a giant im- www.insightsonindia.com6 pact between a Mars-sized object and the early Earth. o By studying the lunar south pole, scientists can gain insights into the materials and conditions that existed during the formation of the Earth-Moon system. •\t Global Collaborations: ISRO-NASA successfully confirmed the presence of water from the data taken by Chan- drayaan-1. Indo-Japan collaboration, LUPEX aims to send a lander and rover to the Moon’s south pole around 2024. •\t Technological Advancements: By undertaking missions to this region, ISRO can develop and demonstrate innovative technologies for soft landing, navigation, resource utilization, and long-duration operations that can be applied in future space missions. Comparision of Chandrayaan-1, 2 and 3 Mission Chandrayaan-1 Chandrayaan-2 Chandrayaan-3 Launch Year 2008 2019 Scheduled for 2023 Objectives Study lunar surface Study the lunar surface and land rover on the lunar South Pole Demonstrate landing capabilities for Lunar Polar Exploration Mission Components Orbiter, Moon Impact Probe Orbiter, Lander (Vikram), Rov- er (Pragyan) Propulsion module, Lander, Rover Findings Confirmed presence of lunar water, lunar caves, tectonic ac- tivity, faults, and fractures Building on the evidence of water molecules shown by Chandrayaan-1 - Communication Communication issues after 312 days of operation Lander crash-landed, rover un- able to operate - Launch Vehicle PSLV GSLV-Mk 3 LVM3 Landing Site - Lunar South Pole Lunar South Pole Major Partners - - Japan (for Lunar Polar Exploration Mission) About LVM3: Launch Vehicle Mark 3 (LVM3) (previously known as GSLV-MK III) is a three-stage launch vehicle consisting of two solid propellants S200 strap-ons on its sides and a core stage comprising L110 liquid stage and C25 cryogenic stage. The vehicle is also dubbed as one of the heaviest for its ability to carry satellites up to 8,000 kg. Insta Links: Chandrayaan-3 Mains Links: Q.

Other initiatives for sustainable dining: •\t Restaurant Edible Archives in Goa uses local ingre- dients and practising on-site composting •\t Frea in Berlin and Rest in Oslo have been recognized for their sustainable practices, including using blem- ished or misshapen vegetables and on-site compost- ing. •\t Pisticci in New York practices organic farming and composts its organic waste. •\t Silo in London manages production waste effective- ly and features dining furniture made from upcy- cled materials. Use: The examples can be used in the Environment paper as an initiative to reduce food waste and address climate change. Facts for Prelims (FFP) SANGAM-AGE STUD, BEAD UN- EARTHED IN TAMIL NADU Context: Archaeologists conducting excavations at Porpa- naikottai in Tamil Nadu, India, have discovered several ar- tefacts, including a gold stud, a bone point, and a carnelian bead. •\t These findings provide insights into the culture and trade during the Sangam Age, a period in ancient Tamil history. Key findings: •\t The carnelian bead, a round-shaped red stone, was also discovered at the site. Similar beads have been found in other parts of Tamil Nadu, indicating a sys- tem of domestic trade. Carnelian stones were com- monly sourced from Gujarat. •\t In addition to these artefacts, the excavation has re- vealed a three-course brick structure and over 150 other antiquities, such as potsherds, glass bangles, beads, a terracotta lamp, a coin, a spindle whorl, and rubbing stones. Overall, these discoveries shed light on the material culture, trade networks, and social organization during the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu. About Sangam Age: Sangam Age refers to the period of the history of ancient Tamil Nadu, Kerala spanning from the 6th century BCE to c. 3rd century CE. LAMBANI ART Context: PM has praised the Guinness World Record achieved for the “largest display of Lambani items,” total- ling 1755 items, during the 3rd G20 Culture Working Group Meeting held in Hampi, Karnataka What is Lambani art? It is a traditional form of art and craft practised by the Lam- bani community, also known as the Banjara community in Karnataka. It is characterized by its vibrant colours, intricate embroidery, and mirror work. It has quilting stitches with borders of “Kangura” patchwork. Lambani art includes a wide range of products, such as clothing, textiles, accesso- ries, home decor items, and jewellery. It received the status of Geographic Indication (GI) tag in 2010 from Karnataka. About Banjara Community: The word ‘banjara’ is derived from Vanaj meaning to trade, and Jara meaning to travel. Banjara (sometimes called Gyp- sies) are commercial nomads. With roots in Rajasthan, Ban- jaras now live in several states and are known by different names like •\t Lambada or Lambadi in Andhra Pradesh •\t Lambani in Karnataka •\t Gwar or Gwaraiya in Rajasthan The language of Banjara is known as “Gorboli” “Gor mati Boli” or “Brinjari” an independent dialect ( under the cate- gory of Indo-Aryan language) NARI ADALATS The Indian government is launching a unique initiative to establish women-only courts (known as Nari Adalats) at the village level as an alternative dispute resolution forum for issues such as domestic violence and property rights. •\t The pilot project will start in 50 villages each in As- sam and Jammu and Kashmir in August and will lat- er be expanded to the rest of the country. www.insightsonindia.com8 Composition: The Nari Adalat of each village would have 7-9 members – half of which (Nyaya Sakhis [legal friends]) would be the elected members of the gram panchayat and the oth- er half women with social standing like teachers, doctors and social workers – who would be nominated by the villagers. •\t The head of Nari Adalat called the Mukhya Nyaya Sakhi [chief legal friend] will be chosen among the Nyay Sakhis. Tenure of Head: The tenure of the head will be generally six months after which a new one will be selected. Aim: The courts aim to address individual cases, raise aware- ness about social schemes, and provide accessible and af- fordable justice through alternate dispute resolution, coun- selling, and grievance redressal. Part of Mission Shakti: The initiative is part of the Sambal sub-scheme of Mission Shakti (Ministry of Women and Child Development), which focuses on strengthening women’s safety, security, and empowerment. •\t The scheme draws inspiration from the Parivarik Mahila Lok Adalats, which were run by the Nation- al Commission for Women until 2014-15 and ad- dressed family and matrimonial disputes. Implementation: Collaboration between the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Rural Development and Common Service Cen- ters operated by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. PERFORMANCE GRADING INDEX FOR DISTRICTS (PGI-D) 2.0 Context: The Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSE&L), under the Ministry of Education, has released the Performance Grading Index for Districts (PGI-D) combined report for 2020-21 and 2021-22. •\t This index assesses the performance of the school education system at the district level by creating a comprehensive analysis. •\t PGI is aligned with new initiatives of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, to monitor indicators relating to Goal 4 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Findings: •\t None of the districts secured the top two grades — Daksh and Utkarsh. Most districts were in the bot- tom three grades (less than 10% to 30%). •\t It is grouped under 6 categories viz., Outcomes, Ef- fective Classroom Transaction, Infrastructure Facili- ties & Student’s Entitlements, School Safety & Child Protection, Digital Learning and Governance Pro- cess. This is the PGI 2.0. The first PGI was released in 2017-18. PGI 2.0 has classified states/UTs into ten grades, where the highest achievable grade is ‘Daksh’ and the lowest grade is ‘Akanshi-3’. Assessment is done in the 6 domains, viz., Learning Out- comes (LO), Access (A), Infrastructure& Facilities (IF), Eq- uity (E), Governance Process (GP) and Teachers Education and Training (TE&T).

INDIA JOINS THE CHAMPIONS GROUP OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS RESPONSE GROUP Context: India has accepted an invitation from United Na- tions Secretary-General António Guterres to join the Cham- pions Group of the Global Crisis Response Group (GCRG). About GCRG •\t The GCRG was established (in 2022) by the UN Sec- retary-General to address urgent global issues re- lated to food security, energy, and finance, and to coordinate a global response. •\t It is overseen by the Champions Group consisting of heads of state or government from Bangladesh, Barbados, Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, and Sen- egal. India’s decision to join the group signifies its growing global leadership and commitment to addressing contemporary global challenges. India’s participation will enhance the United Nations’ efforts in finding effective solutions for de- velopmental issues that affect the world, particularly de- veloping countries. EXPORT CONTROL Context: China has implemented export restrictions on gal- lium and germanium, two elements crucial for chip produc- tion, solar panels, and fibre optics. What is Export control? Export control refers to the regulations and restrictions imposed by governments on the export of certain goods, technologies, and services. It is designed to protect national security, prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass de- struction, and ensure compliance with international agree- ments. www.insightsonindia.com9 Why this move? This move is seen as a retaliation to the export restrictions imposed by the US and Western allies on cutting-edge tech- nologies. Impact: •\t Negative: Countries may face chip shortage: China’s control over the supply chain and the licensing sys- tem of these minerals could give them more lever- age in trade negotiations, and create constraints for other countries. o This development further escalates the on- going technology war between nations (par- ticularly between US and China) •\t Positive: With China’s restrictions, other countries can ramp up their production to substitute for Chi- na’s supply. However, It remains to be seen how oth- er countries will respond and diversify their supply chains for these critical materials. About Gallium Gallium is a soft, silvery metal that is often found in small amounts in various minerals. Gallium has a low melting point, making it useful for applications such as thermom- eters and as a component in alloys. It is also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, LEDs, and various elec- tronic devices. About Germanium: Germanium is a lustrous, hard, greyish-white metalloid that is commonly found in trace amounts in certain miner- als. Germanium has semiconductor properties, making it useful in electronic devices such as transistors and diodes. It is also used in infrared optics, fibre optics, and solar cells. Germanium has a high refractive index and excellent ther- mal conductivity, which makes it valuable in optical and thermal applications. CAPTIVE BREEDING OF FISHES Context: The Centre for Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Visakhapatnam is engaged in captive breeding and seed production of Groupers, John’s Snapper, and Indian Pompano at its mariculture lab. Fish Species Local Name Groupers (Up to 9 kg) Bbonthalu John’s Snapper (Up to 8 kg) appalu chepa Indian Pompano (2.5 kg - 5 kg) chanduvapara These fish species, typically found in deep waters, are being bred to provide sustained income to coastal fish farmers af- fected by frequent cyclones. Captive breeding of fishes refers to the practice of breed- ing and rearing fish species in controlled environments such as fish farms, hatcheries, or aquariums. India’s Status in Fish Production: India is the third largest fish-producing country, contribut- ing 8 per cent to global fish production and ranks second in aquaculture production. About CMFRI: The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (HQ: Kochi, founded: 1947; Ministry: Ministry of Agriculture and Farm- ers Welfare; under ICAR) is the leading tropical marine fish- eries research institute in the world FIRST-EVER VIEW OF THE MILKY WAY Context: Scientists have used data from the Ice Cube Neutri- no Observatory in Antarctica to obtain the first view of the Milky Way galaxy through the lens of neutrino particles. •\t This breakthrough provides researchers with a new perspective on the cosmos, as neutrinos offer a dif- ferent way to study cosmic rays. Neutrinos, which are low-mass particles that interact weak- ly with matter, are emitted when cosmic rays collide with interstellar matter. Key Findings: •\t By analysing the data, scientists were able to differ- entiate between neutrinos of astrophysical origin and those generated from cosmic ray collisions in the Earth’s atmosphere. •\t The study revealed that nearly 7% of the observed neutrino events were astrophysical in nature, re- jecting the hypothesis that all events were due to cosmic rays hitting the Earth’s atmosphere. •\t This research opens new avenues for studying high- ly energetic processes in the galaxy and promises further insights as the IceCube-Gen2 experiment expands in the future. www.insightsonindia.com10 EVIDENCE OF SUPERBUG FOUND IN DELHI’S STRAY DOGS Context: Scientists from Delhi University and McMaster Uni- versity in Canada have discovered and isolated the first live culture of the drug-resistant fungus Candida auris (C. auris) from the ear canals of stray dogs in Delhi. About C. auris: •\t C. auris is a dangerous fungus known for causing persistent and severe infections, often leading to widespread outbreaks in hospitals. The research highlights the need to address the role of ani- mals in the spread of drug-resistant infections and the po- tential risks they pose to human health.
