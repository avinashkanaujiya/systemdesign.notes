Background: The new guidelines come after the SC’s ruling seeking modification in the guidelines issued by the SC (in 2018) aftermath of its Indira Jaisingh ruling (2017). How were advocates designated before the 2017 ruling? ● The Advocates Act 1961 states two classes of advo- cates - senior advocates and other advocates. ● A senior advocate must be a deserving candidate [ by virtue of his ability, standing at the Bar, or special knowledge or experience in law] in the opinion of the SC or an HC]. ● It was the Chief Justice and the judges who desig- nates an advocate as a ‘senior’ advocate. What did the court decide in the Indira Jaising case? ● Indira Jaising (India’s first woman Senior Advocate) challenged the existing process as opaque, arbitrary and fraught with nepotism. ● The SC (in 2017) decided to lay down guidelines for itself and all HCs on the process of designating se- nior advocates. ● It decided the setting up of a permanent committee and a permanent secretariat. ● Permanent secretariat - ○ Is a body tasked with receiving and compil- ing all applications for designation. ○ Published the proposal for designation on the official website of the concerned court, inviting suggestions and views. ○ Forward these suggestions to the perma- nent committee for scrutiny. ● The committee then interview the candidate and made an overall evaluation based on a point system that gave marks for - ○ years of practice ○ pro-bono work undertaken ○ judgements ○ publications and ○ a personality test ● Once a candidate’s name was approved, it was for- warded to the Full Court to decide on the basis of the majority. ● The Full Court could also recall the designation of a senior advocate. www.insightsonindia.com3 ● The SC had acknowledged (in its 2017 ruling) that the guidelines are not exhaustive and left them open for consideration by this Court. The Guidelines to Regulate the Conferment of Designation of Senior Advocates 2018: ● These were released to bring greater transparency to the designation process. ● The guidelines discouraged the system of voting by secret ballot, except in cases where it was unavoid- able. ● A permanent committee was created and empow- ered with powers of conferment. ○ The CJI-chaired committee was to consist of two senior-most SC judges, the Attorney General of India, and a member of the Bar nominated by the chair and other members. ○ The Committee was to meet at least twice a year. ● The CJI or any other judge could recommend the name of an advocate for designation. ● Alternatively, advocates could submit their applica- tions to the Permanent Secretariat. Issues with the 2018 guidelines: ● The point-based system (which awarded 40% weightage to publications, personality and suitabil- ity) is subjective, ineffective and dilutes the esteem and dignity of the honour being conferred tradition- ally. ● The rampant circulation of bogus journals could be published by paying a nominal amount. ● Discontinuation of a secret ballot disincentivises the judges from expressing their views about the suitability of any candidate. New vs Old guidelines Dimensions 2023 guidelines2018 guidelines Minimum age to apply for the senior ad- vocate desig- nation 45 years No minimum age How can the CJI/ a judge recommend a name? The CJI along with any Judge of the SC may recom- mend in writing the name of an advocate for the designation The CJI along with “any judge” can recommend an ad- vocate’s name for designation Relaxation in age limit Can be given by the Committee/ the CJI or an SC judge if they have recommended an advocate’s name Points for pub- lication Only 5 marks will be given for the combined - pub- lication of aca- demic articles, the experience of teaching in the field of law, and guest lectures de- livered 15 marks were set aside for publica- tions Weightage giv- en to reported and unreport- ed judgements (excluding or- ders that do not lay down any principle of law) 50 points 40 points Insta Links: Why does the Centre want to revisit the process for des- ignating senior advocates at Supreme Court, High Courts?

Challenges hindering the development of Railways in India: •\t Congested networks: Overstretched infrastructure with 60% plus routes being more than 100 per cent utilized, leading to a reduction in the average speed of passenger and freight trains. •\t Efficiency: Low efficiency of the Railways in terms of the human resources it employs, and their capacity. •\t The decline in the growth of internal revenue gen- www.insightsonindia.com5 eration: A decline in the growth of internal revenue generation has meant that Railways has been fund- ing its capital expenditure through budgetary sup- port from the central government and borrowings. o While the support from the central govern- ment has mostly remained consistent, Rail- ways’ borrowings have been increasing. •\t Centralised decision making: Currently, deci- sion-making in Railways is centralised. The Railway Board has the powers of policy-making, operations, and regulation. Railway zones have very limited powers with regard to raising their own revenue. o Therefore, they are unable to contribute more effectively towards improving Rail- ways’ revenue. •\t Safety and poor quality of service delivery: There have been a number of accidents and safety issues. However, it has declined off late. o Poor cleanliness of trains and stations, de- lays in booking/train departures and arrivals and in booking tickets are key issues. •\t Competition from the Aviation Industry: Due to an increased quality of life and rapid lifestyle changes necessitated by an increase in personal disposable income, the Indian railways are also facing stiff com- petition from airlines as a means of transportation and travel which doesn’t bode well for the railways. •\t A vicious cycle for Railways: Poor finances of Rail- ways had led to low investment in infrastructure. Low investment means Railways’ infrastructure and services take a hit (resulting in low speed, delays, and safety issues). o Poor infrastructure and services result in loss of remunerative business for Railways which leads to further deterioration of fi- nances. Measures taken by Indian Railways: Measure Description New Trains •\t The benefits of the Vande Bharat trains include stimulat- ing local manufacturing and providing an upgraded travel experience •\t Vistadome Trains: Running in most scenic routes and im- proves tourism Special Freight Train Operations Scheme Allows private enterprises to run freight trains from their private termi- nals, leading to speedier cargo evacu- ation. Mission Raftaar Aims to double the average speed of freight trains and increase the aver- age speed of Superfast/Mail/Express trains by 25 kmph. Amrit Bharat Station Scheme Aims to equip stations with facilities inspired by the mega-upgradation of marquee stations such as New Delhi and Ahmedabad, but at a lower cost. Indian Railway Ma n a g emen t Service (IRMS) Marks a paradigm shift in the manage- ment of Indian Railways, aiming to ra- tionalize the top-heavy bureaucracy. TCAS (Train Col- lision Avoidance System) An indigenously developed system to minimize accidents caused by human error. Measures to ex- pedite project commissioning •\t Assured finance through ex- tra-budgetary resources for throughput enhancement works. •\t Emphasis on proper project preparation, advanced land ac- quisition, EPC contracts, mech- anization in construction, and intensive project monitoring to increase the pace of com- missioning. Role of National Rail Plan (NRP) for 2030: Indian Railways have recently prepared a National Rail Plan (NRP) for India – 2030 to create a ‘future ready’ Railway system by 2030. The objective of the Plan is to create capacity ahead of demand, which in turn would also cater to future growth in demand right up to 2050. Features of the plan: Feature Description Focus on freight: Increase the modal share of Railways in freight to 45% by 2030. Substantially reduce transit time by in- creasing the average speed of freight trains to 50 kmph. N a t i o n a l Rail Plan, Vision 2024: Accelerated implementation of critical proj- ects by 2024. 100% electrification and multi-tracking of congested routes. Upgradation of speed to 160 kmph on Del- hi-Howrah and Delhi-Mumbai routes. Upgradation of speed to 130 kmph on all other Golden Quadrilateral-Golden Diago- nal (GQ/GD) routes. Elimination of all Level Crossings on GQ/ GD routes. Conclusion The need of the hour is to find a balanced solution that would incorporate the pros of both private and government enterprises and enhance the image of Indian Railways as it continues to serve the world’s largest democracy. www.insightsonindia.com6 Insta Links: Growth in Indian railways Mains Links: Q.

UAE is India’s third-largest trading partner while In- dia is UAE 2 nd largest trading partner. What is a Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS)? The Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS) is a mechanism that enables cross-border transactions between two coun- tries to be conducted in their respective domestic curren- cies. •\t It allows exporters and importers to invoice and make payments in their local currencies, reducing the reliance on a third-party currency such as the US dollar. For example, Let’s consider a scenario where a company in India exports goods to a company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With the LCSS in place, the Indian exporter can issue an invoice in Indian rupees (INR), and the UAE importer can make the payment in UAE dirhams (AED). Advantages: Advantages Examples Re duc tion in foreign e x chang e costs An Indian exporter can invoice in INR, and a UAE importer can pay in AED, eliminat- ing the need for currency conversion to a third-party currency like USD. Mitigation of exchange rate risks Companies can hedge exchange rate risks by transacting in local currencies, limiting losses caused by fluctuations in exchange rates. I mp r o v ed transaction efficiency Transaction processes can be streamlined as parties can invoice and settle payments in their domestic currencies, reducing com- plexities and time delays. Enhanc e d trade and investment opportuni- ties The use of LCSS promotes bilateral trade and investment between India and UAE by facilitating easier and more efficient cross-border transactions. Optimized remittances Indian residents in the UAE can send remit- tances in INR, benefiting from lower trans- action costs and faster settlement times. Other agreements between India and UAE: •\t The two countries agreed to link India’s Unified Pay- ments Interface (UPI) with UAE’s Instant Payment Platform (IPP). •\t The two countries agreed to link their respective Card Switches vis-a-vis RuPay switch and UAESWITCH to enable mutual acceptance of domestic cards and processing of these card transactions. •\t India’s Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) will be linked with messaging system in UAE to ease their financial messaging. •\t Also, India will establish an IIT-Delhi campus in Abu Dhabi, which would be the second IIT abroad after Tanzania.

What is CCHF? Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease transmitted by ticks (Hyalomma ticks). It can also be con- tracted through contact with infected animal tissues. •\t Background: Congo fever was first discovered in Crimea in 1944 and was later named as Crime- an-Congo haemorrhagic fever. •\t Threat: CCHF outbreaks pose a public health threat, as the virus can lead to epidemics and has a high fatality rate. •\t Symptoms: It includes fever, muscle ache, head- ache, and bleeding. •\t Vaccine: There is currently no vaccine for CCHF, and treatment involves managing symptoms and using antiviral drugs in some cases. •\t Region: It is endemic to Africa, the Balkan countries, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. How Climate change is contributing to its spread? Rising temperatures and disrupted climate patterns have created favourable conditions for viruses not typically found in colder climates. Climate change contributes to the spread of diseases by expanding the habitat of disease-carrying in- sects, altering water habitats, and causing changes in animal migration patterns, increasing human contact with infected animals. UNIVERSE EXPANSION DISPUTE Context: Researchers from the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bengaluru, the Inter-Universi- ty Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), have proposed a new method to determine the Hubble constant, a value critical in understanding the universe’s expansion rate. About the Universe: The universe, born from the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago, has been expanding, with its expansion rate ini- tially rapid and then slowing down. However, about five to six billion years ago, dark energy caused the universe’s ex- pansion to accelerate again. What is Universe Expansion Dispute? The dispute surrounding the expansion of the universe cen- tres on determining the precise rate at which it is expand- ing, known as the Hubble constant. Multiple methods have been used to calculate this constant, including analyzing the brightness of supernovae, studying the cosmic microwave background, and observing gravitational waves. However, these methods have provided conflicting results, with some measurements reporting higher values than oth- ers. This discrepancy has led to a crisis in cosmology, as sci- entists seek to reconcile these differing measurements and understand the true rate of expansion. What is the new method? In an effort to address this dispute, researchers from vari- ous institutions have proposed new methods, such as using lensed gravitational waves, to independently estimate the Hubble constant. The researchers believe that upcoming gravitational-wave detectors could identify lensed gravita- tional waves, which can then be used to calculate the Hubble constant more accurately. LOW-COST PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS Context: Indian scientists at the International Advanced Re- search Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), Hyderabad, have developed highly stable, low-cost Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (CPSCs). •\t These solar cells overcome the challenges of degra- dation during operation, making them suitable for large-scale commercialization. What are Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)? Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a type of solar cell that uti- lizes perovskite materials as the light-harvesting active lay- er to convert sunlight into electricity. The most commonly used perovskite material in solar cells is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). Issues with PSCs? Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) face stability issues when ex- posed to heat, moisture, and other environmental factors. Solution: The scientists engineered MaPbI3 to enhance thermal sta- bility by incorporating Guanidinium iodide (GuI) and mois- ture stability by using 5-amino valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) for surface passivation. This breakthrough can resolve sta- bility concerns and reduce fabrication costs, potentially ac- celerating the commercialization of perovskite-based niche products. www.insightsonindia.com8 Significance of PSCs: They have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize the solar energy industry, offering advantages such as low-cost manufacturing, high efficiency, and the ability to be printed onto flexible sub- strates. GHAGGAR RIVER Context: In early July this year, the Ghaggar River and its tributaries in Haryana, caused widespread devastation after reclaiming their floodplains. •\t The river, including its tributaries Tangri, Markanda, and others, were previously considered dead and heavily encroached upon. However, due to heavy monsoon rains in the Shivalik hills, the rivers flood- ed their catchment areas and breached their banks, resulting in significant losses. •\t Additionally, unscientific and illegal mining has harmed the natural balance of rivers like the Ghag- gar and Yamuna. About Ghaggar-Hakra River It is an intermittent river in India and Pakistan that flows only during the monsoon season. The river is known as Gh- aggar before the Ottu barrage and as Hakra downstream of the barrage in the Thar Desert. In pre-Harappan times the Ghaggar was a tributary of the Sutlej. •\t Origin: It originates in the village of Dagshai in the Shivalik Hills of Himachal Pradesh and flows throug h Punjab and Haryana states into Rajasthan. •\t Tributaries: The main tributaries of the Ghaggar are the Kaushalya River, Markanda, Sarsuti, Tan- gri and Chautang Sports: WIMBLEDON: CARLOS ALCARAZ Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set final to win his first Wimbledon title. What is Wimbledon? It is one of the four major tennis tournaments known as Grand Slam events. It is held annually in London, England, and is the oldest tennis tournament in the world. The oth- er three Grand Slam tournaments are the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. They feature singles, doubles, and mixed doubles matches, and determine the champions in each category. Grand Slam refers to the accomplishment of winning all four major championships of Australia, France, Britain (Wimble- don), and the United States in the same calendar season Significance: The result sparks speculation about a potential generational shift in men’s tennis. Mapping MANIPUR The violence in Manipur, which resulted in deaths and dis- placement, has drawn international attention and scrutiny. Recently, an EU Parliament resolution mistakenly framed the conflict as having a religious basis, pitting Hindus against Christians. However, experts say, the violence was sparked by a court order to include Meiteis in the list of Scheduled Tribes in the state, which angered the Naga community as well. KERCH BRIDGE (CRIMEA) The Kerch Bridge (also called Crimean Bridge), opened in 2018, is a crucial transportation route between Russia and Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. It has come under attack twice in recent years. The bridge is a pair of parallel bridges, one for a four-lane road and one for a double-track railway, spanning the Kerch Strait between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai in Russia and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
