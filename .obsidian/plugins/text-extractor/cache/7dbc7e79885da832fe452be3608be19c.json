It also aims to highlight its significance in medical potential and create and explore opportunities for healthcare collaborations between the participating countries. The Prime Minister invoked the inclusive vision of health promoted by India, taking inspiration from its civilizational ethos and ancient scriptures. India’ s ancient vision of health was universal. The vision is not just restricted to humans, it extends to our whole ecosystem from plants to animals, from soil to rivers. When everything around us is healthy , we can be healthy .” Reiterating India’ s G20 Presidency theme of “One Earth, One Family , One Future”, the Prime Minister emphasized that “India realizes the importance of resilient global healthcare systems in fulfilling this vision”. He stated that “India sees Medical V alue T ravel and Health workforce mobility as important for a healthy planet. ‘One Earth, One Health’ Advantage Healthcare India 2023 is an important ef fort in this direction”. India has talent, technology , track record and tradition. Both in India and outside, our doctors are widely respected for their competence and commitment. Similarly , nurses and other caregivers from India are also well known. There are many healthcare systems across the world which benefit from the talent of Indian professionals. India has tremendous diversity in culture, climate and social dynamics. Healthcare professionals trained in India are exposed to diverse experiences. This helps them develop skills that can meet the needs of dif ferent situations. This is why Indian healthcare talent has won the world’ s trust”. India has a great tradition of preventive and promotive health with Indian practices such as Y oga and meditation now becoming global movements. Need for One Health: India has gained a strong foothold worldwide as the “global medical destination” with Indian MVT market size expected to grow to USD 13 Bn by 2026 from present value of USD 5-6 Bn. One Health recognizes that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are interconnected. 2/2 One Health was initiated as a concept, was upgraded to an approach and is recently being considered as a movement. It involves application of a coordinated, collaborative, multi-disciplinary and cross- sectoral approach to address potential or existing risks that originate at the animal- human-ecosystems interface. It also encourages synergistic collaboration to achieve common public health goals. Human health cannot be considered in isolation– It depends highly on the quality of the environment in which people live: for people to be healthy , they need healthy environments. Increasing temperatures are supporting range expansion for disease vectors, with the resulting spread of vector-borne diseases expected in humans and animals. Temperature-related mortality alone is expected to rise to rival current levels of obesity- and diet-related illness. COVID-19 and intersections with the climate-health crisis Growing water and food insecurity and safety hazards What more needs to be done? Scientists have observed that there are more than 1.7 million viruses circulating in wildlife, and many of them are likely to be zoonotic, which implies that unless there is timely detection, India risks facing many more pandemics in times to come. To achieve targets under the ‘One Health’ vision, ef forts are ongoing to address challenges pertaining to veterinary manpower shortages , the lack of information sharing between human and animal health institutions, and inadequate coordination on food safety at slaughter , distribution, and retail facilities. Mainstream health into climate change and biodiversity agendas and fund health programs within the UNFCCC. Integrate health impact assessment in all development project appraisals Assess and quantify the health co-benefits of proposed environmental investments (e.g. REDD+) Increase application of existing climate and health forecasting tools and early warning systems for human and animal health (such as those promoted by the WMO-WHO joint of fice) Conclusion: India being home to a large portion of the world’ s livestock farmers, the absence of a policy framework that ratifies the ‘One Health’ approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty-related diseases. The ecosystem-based approach to Healthcare exists at the interface between the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems and recognizes the inextricable linkages between the health of all species and their environments. A basic tenet held is that health and well-being cannot be sustained on a resource-depleted, polluted, and socially unstable planet.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
