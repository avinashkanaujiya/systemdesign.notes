GURUDEV RABINDRANATH TAGORE Context: The 162nd birth anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tag- ore was celebrated across the globe on May 7. Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore (7th May 1861 – 7th Au- gust 1941) About He was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter. Philosophies • He propagated ideas of humanism, idealism, nationalism and interna- tionalism. • One of the most remarkable institu- tions established by Tagore - Visva Bharati University (1921) - ushered in a new era of Indian nationalism (incorporating all the best aspects of Western culture into the best of Indi- an culture). Contributions 1. As a freedom fighter: • For him, true freedom meant the ability to be truthful and honest with oneself otherwise autonomy loses all of its worth. • He viewed British rule as a symptom of the overall “sickness” of the social “disease” of the public. • He wrote the song ‘Banglar Mati Banglar Jol’ (Soil of Bengal, Water of Bengal) to unite the Bengali popula- tion after the Bengal partition in 1905. • He actively participated in the Swadeshi movement (1905). Being shocked when it broke into communal violence, he withdrew from the movement. • He wrote the ‘Amar Sonar Bangla’ (adopted as the national anthem of Bangladesh later) and ‘Jana Gana Mana’ (adopted as the national anthem of indepen- dent India later) which helped ignite a feeling of na- tionalism amongst people. • For Hindu-Muslim unity, he started the Rakhi festival. He renounced the Knighthood in protest of the Jallian- wala Bagh massacre (1919). 2. As a social reformer: • He constantly questioned the importance of caste in India’s discourse. • In his poem - ‘The Sacred Touch’ (in the Harijan) and drama - ‘Chandalika’, he shunned untouchability as being inhumane. • His works - Chokher Bali (on themes like widowhood, patriarchy and child marriage), Maanbhajan, and Aparichita (shunning the practice of dowry) - touched upon almost all the social evils of that time. Works • He published his first poems at the age of 16 under the pen name ‘Bha- nusimha’. • Notable works include Gitanjali, Ghare-Baire, Gora, Manasi, Balaka, and Sonar Tori. He is also remem- bered for his song ‘Ekla Chalo Re’. • For all his contributions he is widely known as ‘Kavi guru’. Tagore vs Gandhi • He was a good friend of Mahatma Gandhi and is said to have given him the title of Mahatma. However, both disagreed on key issues at times. • For example, Tagore sharply criti- cised Gandhi, after he blamed the prevalence of untouchability for the massive earthquake in Bihar. • Tagore renounced British imperial- ism, yet he did not fully support or agree with Gandhi and his Non-co- operation movement. Awards • In 1913 he became the first non-Eu- ropean to have won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his novel ‘Geetanja- li’. • Knighthood was given to him by Lord Hardinge in 1915. Relevance to- day Tagore’s ideas on nationalism, human- ism, internationalism and divinity stay as alive and relevant. Prelims Links: (UPSC 2021) Q.

ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN ISSUE: 75 YEARS SINCE THE DISPLACEMENT OF 700,000 PAL- ESTINIANS Context: UN commemorated the mass displacement of Palestinians, known as the Nakba, for the first time in its history. What is Nakba (catastrophe)? It refers to the mass displacement and exodus of Palestin- ians that occurred in 1948 when Israel was established. It resulted in approximately 700,000 Palestinians being forced to leave their homes, becoming refugees. Why were Palestinians displaced? Palestinians were displaced primarily as a result of the es- tablishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The displacement occurred during the Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel’s declaration of independence. A brief timeline of the Israel-Palestinian issue: • Early 20th century: Jews and Arabs both claim histori- cal and ancestral connections to the land of Palestine. • 1917: Balfour Declaration expresses support for a Jewish national home in Palestine • 1947: The United Nations proposes a partition plan, recommending separate Jewish and Arab states in Pal- estine. • 1948: Israel declares independence, leading to the Ar- ab-Israeli war. • 1967: The Six-Day War takes place, with Israel gaining control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights. • 1993: The Oslo Accords are signed, establishing a framework for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. • Current situation: Israel occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with the construction of Israeli settle- ments and separation barriers impacting Palestinian territories. Status of Palestinian Refugees: The status of Palestinian refugees remains a significant and unresolved issue. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), there are approximately 6 million registered Palestinian refugees. Many of them continue to live in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Views of the International Community: The international community supports a two-state solution, where Israel and a future independent Palestine exist side by side. Various peace talks and initiatives, such as the Camp Da- vid Summit in 2000 and the Annapolis Conference in 2007, have aimed to resolve the conflict but have not yet resulted in a final agreement. In 2020, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed normalization agreements with Israel. Views of India: India’s views on the Israel-Palestinian issue have evolved over time. Historically, India supported the Palestinian cause and recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organiza- tion (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Pales- tinian people. However, in recent years, India has adopted a more balanced approach and emphasized its commitment to a two-state solution. India supports the establishment of a sovereign, independent, and viable Palestinian state exist- ing peacefully alongside Israel. Conclusion: The UN marking 75 years since the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians recognizes historical injustice, affirms Palestin- ian rights, advocates for a peaceful resolution, and shows solidarity with Palestinians. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 10 Insta Links: Israel Palestine conflict Mains Links: Q. “India’s relations with Israel have, of late, acquired a depth and diversity, which cannot be rolled back.” Discuss.

EROSION OF THE TRADITIONAL INDIAN FAMILY Context: The article highlights the increasing cases of violence with- in families, suicides among young individuals, and the rising number of children involved in criminal activities as symp- toms of societal ill-health and disruptions in the traditional family system. What is a family? A family is a social unit consisting of individuals who are re- lated by blood, marriage, or adoption. It is a fundamental institution in society where members provide support, love, and care for one another, and share common experiences, values, and responsibilities. What is the meaning of a traditional Indian family? The traditional Indian family refers to the prevailing fami- ly structure and dynamics that have been historically and culturally prevalent in Indian society. It typically follows a patriarchal system where the father or eldest male mem- ber holds authority and decision-making power within the family. Importance of family: Example Emotional Support During challenging times, such as the loss of a loved one or personal struggles Socializa- tion Family plays a vital role in socializing children, teaching them societal norms, values, and behaviours Ide n tity Formation Family provides a sense of belonging and helps individuals develop their identity by instilling cultural, religious, and familial val- ues. Intergen- erat i o n al Bonding The presence of multiple generations in a family fosters intergenerational relation- ships, creating opportunities for shared wis- dom, experiences, and mutual learning. Moral and Ethical De- velopment Families teach principles of honesty, integrity, compassion, and responsibility. India swear by Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Kutumb or family has traditionally acquired primacy in human interpersonal-social rela- tionship dynamics. Education Guidance and Financial Support Challenges faced by the traditional family system: Example Changing Ge nde r Roles For instance, if a woman desires a career out- side the home but is expected to prioritize domestic responsibilities, conflicts may arise. Ge ne r - a tional Gap When younger members adopt different val- ues, lifestyles, and beliefs than their older rel- atives. Urbaniza- tion and Mobility As individuals seek better opportunities or education, they may move away from their extended families, leading to a decrease in close-knit family support networks. Influence of Tech- nology Technology can impact traditional family dy- namics, with increased screen time and vir- tual interactions potentially diminishing the sense of togetherness within the family. Excessive emphasis on Indi- vidualism For example, candid and heart-to-heart di- alogues between husband-wife and par- ent-children are becoming rare. They have become too formal and superficial. This chal- lenges the collectivist nature of traditional family systems. Excessive Formalisation From birthdays to weddings and house-warmings to con- dolence meetings, everything is being made into a formal event. This creates the “crisis of authenticity” of our inter- personal feelings. C ultur al and Social Changes Cultural and social changes, such as global- ization and exposure to diverse perspectives, can challenge traditional family norms and values. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 11 Balancing Work and Family The traditional family system may face difficul- ties in accommodating individual aspirations while maintaining traditional family roles and responsibilities. Ways of Reviving India’s Traditional Family System: Example Promote In- ter-generational Bonding Using storytelling, family meals, and cultural celebrations. Strengthen Com- munication and Dialogue Promote dialogue that goes beyond formalities and embraces deeper emotional connections. Value Traditional Values and Cus- toms Encourage the preservation of tradi- tional values, customs, and cultural practices within the family, ensuring that they are passed down to younger generations. Foster Mutual Support and Care E.g., provide emotional support during challenging times and engage in acts of kindness and assistance. Balance Individu- alism and Collec- tivism E.g., Encourage family members to pursue personal goals while maintain- ing a sense of togetherness, shared de- cision-making, and a commitment to the welfare of the family unit. Embrace Modern Technology Re- sponsibly E.g., Encouraging the use of technolo- gy for virtual family gatherings, shar- ing updates, and staying connected across distances. Promote Gender Equality and Em- powerment Advocate for gender equality within the family, promoting shared respon- sibilities, equal opportunities, and em- powering women to pursue their aspi- rations. Woman-led, child-focused and elder- ly-sensitive families are the need of the hour Conclusion: The traditional Indian family system holds immense value and significance in providing emotional support, socializa- tion, identity formation, and a sense of belonging. Reviving and nurturing the traditional family system can contribute to the well-being of individuals, the cohesion of society, and the preservation of cultural heritage. Mains Links: Q.

THE BATTLE TO END CHILD MARRIAGE Context: According to UNICEF, multiple crises are threatening to re- verse hard-earned gains in the decline in child marriage. Child marriage: • It refers to any formal marriage or informal union between a child under the age of (18 for females and 21 for males in India) and an adult or another child. • Most child marriages involve girls, many of whom are in poor socio-economic conditions. Data on child marriage: • Worldwide, an estimated 640 million girls and wom- en alive today were married in childhood, or 12 mil- lion girls per year. • Child marriages have declined from 21 to 19% (glob- ally) since the last estimates were released five years ago. • However, global reductions would have to be 20 times faster to meet SDG 5.3 of ending child mar- riage by 2030. Status in India: • While India has recorded significant progress in re- cent decades, it still accounts for one-third of the global total (India’s child marriage rate is 21% as per NHFS-5). • 8 States have a higher prevalence of child marriage than the national average - West Bengal, Bihar and Tripura top the list with more than 40% of women aged 20-24 years married below 18. Most affected regions: • South Asia continues to remain home to nearly half (45%) of the world’s child brides. • Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the second-largest global share of child brides (20%). Highlights of the UNICEF’s findings: • The world is engulfed by a ‘Polycrisis’ - a cluster of related global risks with compounding effects, such that the overall impact exceeds the sum of each part. • Health and economic crises (rising poverty, income shocks), escalating armed conflicts, climate change shocks and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 are forcing families into child marriage. • Girls living in fragile settings are twice as likely to become child brides as the average girl globally. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 12 Fig: Factors Driving Child Marriage Immediate and lifelong consequences on girls: • Less likely to remain in school. • Difficult for girls to access health care, social ser- vices and community support that protect them from child marriage. • Increased risk of early pregnancy → increasing the risk of child and maternal health complications and mortality. • Can also isolate girls from family and friends, taking a heavy toll on their mental health and well-being. Laws and policy interventions in India: • The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012 aim at protecting children from violation of human and other rights. • A parliamentary standing committee is weighing the pros and cons of raising the age of marriage for women to 21, which has been cleared by the Union Cabinet. • Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana: The government launched this scheme in 2015 to encourage par- ents to save money for the future of their girl child • Kanyashree Prakalpa Scheme: The West Bengal government launched this scheme in 2013 to pro- mote the education and welfare of girls and pre- vent child marriage in the state. • National Plan of Action for Children: The plan includes strategies to prevent child marriage and promote education and healthcare for children • Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme Way ahead for India: • The solution lies in empowering girls, creating prop- er public infrastructure and addressing societal norms. • At the gram panchayat level, ensuring that Child Protection Committees and Child Marriage Prohibi- tion officers are doing the job and activating com- munity support groups. \t Best practice: Odisha now has over 12,000 Child Marriage Free Villages. Conclusion: It is possible to end child marriage, which requires unwav- ering support for vulnerable girls and families. The focus should be on keeping girls in school and making sure they have economic opportunities. Insta Links: ILO–UNICEF joint report on social protection for children 5. HOW PROSPERITY FUELS DOWRY DE- MAND IN INDIA Context: A recent study has revealed that as prosperity and opportu- nities for men in India have improved, the demand for dowry has increased. • The researchers examined more than 74,000 mar- riages in India between 1930 and 1999 to examine the evolution of dowry over time. Key findings of the study about Dowry in India: • Economic growth perpetuates and boosts the prac- tice of dowry payments in India • As men gain better education and higher-quality jobs, dowry amounts increase. • Dowry payments decrease as more women receive education in an area. • Promoting women’s education and increasing their participation in the workforce can potentially help reduce the prevalence of dowry. • Families refusing to pay dowry may end up with lower-quality grooms for their daughters, creating a strong economic incentive for grooms to accept dowry. • No correlation with caste-based factors: The prac- tice of dowry began around the same time for both high and low-caste groups, indicating that caste- based factors do not solely explain its rise. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 13 Status of Marriages in India: • Most Indian marriages are still arranged, and nearly all women marry by their late twenties. • Some 90% of the marriages studied until 1999 in- volved dowry • Nearly all marriages in India are monogamous • Less than 1% end in divorce • Parents play an important role in choosing the bride/groom • Over 90% of couples live with the husband’s family after marriage • More than 85% of women marry someone from outside their own village • Over 78% of marriages are within the same district (Source: India Human Development Survey, 2005; National Family Health Survey 2006; REDS, 1999) What is the Dowry system in India? The dowry system in India refers to the bride’s family giving to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage. Causes of the prevalence of the dowry system in India: Causes Description Patriarchal Soci- ety Women are considered as econom- ic burdens and need to be financially supported. Economic Fac- tors Dowry is seen as a way to provide fi- nancial security to the bride after mar- riage. Social Pressure and Status Expectations from the bride’s family to display their social and economic sta- tus. Gender Inequal- ity Unequal distribution of property and inheritance rights favouring male heirs. Cultural and Tra- ditional Beliefs Deep-rooted customs and traditions have perpetuated the practice of dow- ry. Fear of Social Stigma Concerns about societal judgment and reputation if dowry is not provided. Lack of Legal En- forcement Inadequate implementation and en- forcement of laws against dowry. Lack of Educa- tion and Aware- ness Limited awareness about gender equal- ity and the negative impacts of dowry. Desire for Mate- rial Gain Greed for wealth and material posses- sions led to demands for dowry. Peer and Family Pressure Pressure from extended family, rela- tives, and societal expectations. Consequences of the prevalence of the dowry system in In- dia: • Financial Burden on the Bride’s Family • Abuse: Women are subjected to physical, emotion- al, and mental abuse if dowry demands are not met. • Norms: Reinforcement of patriarchal norms, treating women as inferior and perpetuating gender-based discrimination. • Breakdown of Marriages: Dowry-related disputes and conflicts often lead to marital discord, separa- tion, and even divorce. • Deaths: Cases of dowry deaths, suicides, and bride burning due to dowry disputes and harassment. • Financial dependence: Women’s lack of financial in- dependence and control over their own resources, leads to dependency on their husbands. • Inequality: Preference for investing in dowry over girls’ education, limiting their opportunities for per- sonal and professional growth. • Reinforcement of Harmful Stereotypes: Dowry per- petuates the notion that women are commodities to be bought, reinforcing harmful stereotypes in soci- ety. Provisions to combat the prevalence of the dowry system in India: Provisions Examples Legal provi- sions: Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (Prohibits the giving or taking of dowry); Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (Criminalizes cruelty against married women); Mandatory requirement to report dowry-related offences to the police or concerned authorities. I n s t i t u t i o n a l provisions Family Welfare Committees (Constitu- tion of committees at district levels to review dowry complaints and provide assistance); Women Helpline Numbers; Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agen- cies SC observations In Vishaka vs State of Rajasthan (1997): SC requested the Law Commission of India to take a “fresh look” to bring “more teeth” to the law against dowry. Recently, the Supreme Court has held that Dowry’s death can be presumed if the wife was harassed, mentally and physically close before her death in the marital home.

Ethical aspects of dowry in India: • Violation of human rights, gender inequality, and com- modification of women. • Dowry is considered unethical as it treats women as commodities, subjecting them to financial transactions and devaluing their worth. • Dowry perpetuates gender discrimination, where wom- en are seen as burdens and objects of transaction. • Dowry infringes upon the principles of equality, dignity, and autonomy. • The practice goes against the fundamental values of re- spect, fairness, and justice. • Ethically, dowry is condemned as it promotes inequality, perpetuates harmful stereotypes, and undermines the inherent rights and dignity of women. Conclusion: Educating daughters is a valuable gift that empowers them. Society needs to be aware of the seriousness of crimes relat- ed to dowry. Local communities should be engaged through women’s rights education programs. Misuse of dowry provi- sions should be addressed through laws and safeguards. Mains Links: Q.

INSUFFICIENT REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN INDIA’S WORKFORCE Context: India surpassed China as the world’s most populous coun- try, which led analysts to highlight the potential benefits of India’s demographic dividend. A major obstacle to realizing this potential: Insufficient rep- resentation of women in India’s workforce. Significance of more women in the workforce: India could add $550bn to its GDP by increasing its female labour force participation by just 10% (McKinsey). What does the data say? Nearly half of India’s population is female and yet, the female participation rate in India’s la- bour force has consistently fallen from its peak in 2000 (31%) to a low of 21% in 2018 (World Bank). Reasons for this: ● India is still a largely patriarchal society: ○ Indian women spend 8 times the number of hours on unpaid care work compared with men. The global average is 3 times. ○ Only 32% of Indian women work after they get married and most of them are part of the agricultural sector. ● Safety concerns: Not being able to find jobs close to home also prevent women in big cities from joining the workforce. ● Insufficient formal wage employment opportuni- ties: For example, women employees account for less than 20% of India’s manufacturing sector. ● Concentration in low/non-productive jobs: Like ag- riculture, primary caregiver at home, etc. ● Lack of opportunities for women returning to their careers after a professional break. ● Higher level of participation in education and in- crease in the family income. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 15 Steps taken: • A new Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepre- neurship has been established to coordinate the skill development schemes across various sectors. • The National Career Service (NCS) Project provides a nationwide online platform for job seekers and employers. • The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017 pro- vides for enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and provisions for mandatory crèche facilities. • An advisory to the States under the Factories Act 1948 for permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures. • A network of Women Industrial Training institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes. • A number of protective provisions have been incor- porated in various labour laws - The Equal Remuner- ation Act 1976, The Minimum Wages Act 1948. Best practices: ● TVS (one of India’s biggest two-wheeler manu- facturers): Offers a scheme for women who are returning to their careers (after the break) with flexible working hours, mentoring and training to them. ● Gabriel India Ltd [An auto parts company in Ho- sur (Tamil Nadu)]: It provides perks such as on-site accommodation, subsidised food and training pro- grammes to attract more women workers, as their attrition rates are lower compared to their male counterparts. Way ahead: • A policy framework encouraging and enabling wom- en’s participation should be constructed. • Active awareness of the “gender-specific” con- straints that face most women. • Gender-responsive policies need to be contextually developed. • The goal is not merely to increase female labour force participation, but to provide opportunities for decent work → contribute to the economic empow- erment of women. Conclusion: Women’s labour force participation and access to decent work are important and necessary elements of an inclusive and sustainable development (SDG 5) process. Mains Links: Q.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN SPORTS Common issues faced by women in sports: Issue Examples Lack of funding and support For example, the US women’s soccer team has won more titles than the men’s team but has been paid less. G e nde r-base d discrimination Female athletes may face discrimina- tion based on their gender, such as be- ing told they are not as strong or capa- ble as male athletes. E.g., Indian sport is characterised by a dangerous combination of political nexus and male domination of posi- tions of power. Sexual harass- ment and abuse Tennis player Ruchika Girhotra from 1990 dared to raise her voice against the then president of the tennis feder- ation and IG Haryana Police; Chinese Tennis star Peng Shuai accused former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault (2018); USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal Lack of media coverage Women’s sports events are often giv- en less media coverage compared to men’s events, which can limit their vis- ibility and opportunities for sponsor- ship. Decreased Qual- ity Training Inferior facilities and equipment, lack of quality trained coaches www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 16 S t er eo t y p i n g and objectifica- tion Female athletes may be objectified and stereotyped based on their appear- ance rather than their athletic abili- ties. Social Attitudes and Disfigure- ment Discrimination based on sexual orien- tation and gender identity, negative performance evaluations, and loss of starting position Ethical Issues Some of the ethical issues faced by sexual harassment of women in sports include abuse of power, violation of trust, infringement of human rights, and the creation of hostile and unsafe environments. Steps needed and those taken to address the issues faced by women in sports: Step Example Education and Awareness For instance, the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Athlete365 program offers educational resources on a range of topics including athlete safeguarding. Policy and guidelines de- velopment Sports Authority of India has issued guidelines that mandate female coach- es to accompany female athletes during travel. Reporting and c o mp l ai n t mechanisms Sexual Harassment Electronic Box (SHe- Box) provides single-window access for women to register their complaints of sexual harassment. Accountability and enforce- ment National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notices to the Union Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry and the Sports Authority of India on the reported inappropriate behaviour of a coach. Support and empowerment Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports launched the Khelo India Scheme in 2018 to promote sports at the grassroots level, with a special focus on encourag- ing the participation of girls. What is Internal Complaints Committee? The ICC is the first port of call for any grievance under the PoSH Act, and it needs to have a minimum of four members with at least half of them women and one external mem- ber, preferably from an NGO or an association that works for women’s empowerment or a person familiar with issues related to sexual harassment, like a lawyer. Status of various federations on ICC: Federation ICC Status Gymnastics Federation of India, Table Tennis Federation, Handball Federation, Wrestling Federation, Volleyball Federa- tion, No ICC Judo Federation of India, Squash Rack- ets Federation, Billiards & Snooker Fed- eration ICC has only three members Badminton Association of India, Archery Association, Basketball Federation, Indi- an Triathlon Federation ICC has no ex- ternal member Conclusion: To address the issues faced by women in sports. It will re- quire a concerted effort from various stakeholders, including governments, sports organizations, and civil society, to cre- ate a safe and equitable environment for women in sports.

ISSUES WITH THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT (POSH) ACT Context: The Indian Supreme Court has expressed concern over the “sorry state of affairs” in the implementation of the Protec- tion of Women from Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act. Key issues highlighted by the Supreme Court regarding the implementation of the PoSH Act: Issue Highlighted Uncertainty in I mpl emen t a - tion Uncertainty about whom to approach in case of sexual harassment at the work- place. Reluctance Lack of confidence in the process and its outcome of the PoSH. Women facing sexual harassment in the workplace are reluctant to report such misconduct. I nsen sitiv e comments A hostile, insensitive, and unresponsive working environment towards women employees hampers the success of the Act. Non-C om pli - ance in forming ICC E.g., Only 16 out of 30 national sports federations in the country had consti- tuted Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) mandated under the 2013 Act. Fear of Step- ping out of Homes - If authorities/management/employers cannot assure women a safe and secure workplace, they will fear stepping out of their homes to make a dignified living and exploit their talent and skills to the hilt. Inquiry Process Many times the inquiry process has been done in a “hurry” without adher- ence to the principles of natural justice. Recommendations: • The Union, States, and UTs have been directed by SC to undertake a time-bound (8 weeks) exercise to verify whether Ministries, Departments, gov- ernment organizations, etc., had constituted Inter- nal Complaints Committees (ICCs), Local Commit- tees(LCs), and Internal Committees(ICs) under the Act. • These bodies were ordered to publish the details of their respective committees on their websites Previously, National Commission for Women (NCW) had asked all states to ensure that coaching centres and edu- cational institutes strictly enforce the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Re- dressal) Act, 2013.

MIGRATION AWAY FROM METROS, TO- WARDS SMALL TOWNS Reasons for Migration to Smaller Cities in the IT/ITeS Sec- tor: Reasons Example Remote and hybrid work models Companies like Cognizant allowed em- ployees to work from anywhere (during the pandemic), leading to a shift away from major cities. Companies can establish satellite offices in smaller cities, supporting remote and hybrid work models. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 18 Cost savings Moving to smaller cities allows companies to reduce real estate costs and invest more in people and R&D. Employees can save more in terms of rental costs and experience social benefits in smaller towns. Rich talent pool Smaller cities have untapped talent with a potential talent drain to larger metros, providing opportunities. Higher reten- tion rates Employees prefer to stay in their home- towns, leading to higher retention rates in smaller cities. Availability of office space and ameni- ties Smaller cities like Coimbatore offer qual- ity office spaces with amenities at lower costs compared to metros.

SMART CITIES MISSION Context: The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry (MoHUA) has extended the deadline for the Smart Cities Mission from June 2023 to June 2024. What is the Smart Cities Mission? • It is an initiative of the MoHUA launched as a Cen- trally Sponsored Scheme on June 25, 2015. • To promote cities that provide core infrastructure, and a clean and sustainable environment, 100 cities (to be developed as Smart Cities) have been select- ed through a two-stage competition (from January 2016 to June 2018). • 66 of the cities are small (less than 1 million popu- lation) and are implementing two-thirds of the proj- ects. It aims to: • Drive economic growth through comprehensive work on social, economic, physical and institutional pillars of the city and • Improve the quality of life through smart solutions. • Focus on sustainable and inclusive development by the creation of replicable models which act as light- houses to other aspiring cities. The six fundamental principles on which the concept of Smart Cities is based are: What kinds of projects were proposed? • The project includes making certain stretches of pe- destrian-friendly roads into more capital-intensive ones like laying water pipelines and constructing STPs. • In addition, some PPP infrastructure projects like multi-modal transport hubs, common mobility cards and public bike sharing are included. • All 100 cities have also constructed Integrated Com- mand and Control Centres to monitor all security, emergency and civic services. \t During the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, these were converted into emergency re- sponse units by many of the cities. What is the status of the projects? • The projects were supposed to be completed with- in five years, but in 2021 the Ministry changed the deadline for all cities to June 2023. • As of March 2023, the 100 cities have issued work orders for 7,799 projects worth Rs 1.80 lakh crore. • 50 out of the 100 cities have completed 75% of the projects and would be able to complete the remain- ing works by June. • However, they would need more time to carry out the documentation, dissemination and institution- alisation of the best practices and innovations. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 19 Significance of extending the deadline to June 2024: It will enable all 100 smart cities to not only complete their proj- ects but also document and disseminate the learnings from the mission.

EL NIÑO LIKELY TO BRING EXTREME WEATHER ACROSS THE WORLD Context: According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the world should prepare for the development of El Niño, which is often associated with increased heat, drought or rainfall in different parts of the world. Background: • La Niña has now ended after persisting for three years and the tropical Pacific is currently in an EN- SO-neutral state (neither El Niño nor La Niña). • There is a 60% chance for a transition from EN- SO-neutral to El Niño during May-July 2023. • 2016 was the warmest year on record because of the confluence of a very powerful El Niño event and global warming. The typical impacts of El Niño include: ● Increased rainfall in parts of southern South Amer- ica, the southern US, the Horn of Africa and central Asia. ● Severe droughts over Australia, Indonesia, and parts of southern Asia. ● Warm water during summer in the northern hemi- sphere can fuel hurricanes in the central/eastern Pacific Ocean and can hinder hurricane formation in the Atlantic Basin. Potential threats due to an El Niño event: • A new spike in global heating will increase the chance of breaking temperature records (in 2024). • 50:50 chance of the global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5°C above the pre-industrial era. Likely impact on India: • Normally, El Nino is good for the northeast mon- soon [Oct-Dec in the peninsular region] but bad for the southwest monsoon (dry periods during June- Sept). • The monsoon season (~70% of India’s annual rain- fall) is crucial to India’s agriculture - a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area. • Monsoon drives farm produce, rural spending, in- flation, jobs, and industrial demand. • Good farm output checks food inflation, raises rural incomes and helps inject demand into the economy. Challenge ahead for India: • IMD forecasted a “normal” monsoon at 96% (+/-5%) of the long-period average (LPA is 87 cm for the pe- riod of 1971 to 2020). • An unusually cold start to summer could delay the start of the monsoon season. Way ahead - EW4All: • The Early Warnings For All Initiative (EW4All) was formally launched by the UN Secretary-General in November 2022 at the COP27 meeting in Sharm El- Sheikh. • The Initiative calls for the whole world to be covered by an early warning system by the end of 2027.

Context: According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic/low-pressure area is developing in the Bay of Bengal and may intensify into a cyclonic storm. What this weather system be called? Cyclone Mocha (pro- nounced ‘Mokha’) - a name suggested by Yemen after the Red Sea port city, which is known to have introduced coffee to the world over 500 years ago. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 20 What is a cyclone and how are they formed? Meaning A cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm waters. Mechanism of forma- tion • A high temperature anywhere means the existence of low-pressure air, and a low temperature means high-pressure wind. • As air warms over hotter regions it as- cends, leading to low pressure at the surface it is covering. • In a depression or low-pressure situ- ation, the air is rising and blows in an anticlockwise direction (in the northern hemisphere) around the low. • This is because of the Coriolis effect, a result of the earth’s rotation on its axis. Favourable conditions Warm seas present ripe conditions for the development and strengthening of cyclones and fuel these systems over the water. Effects As warm air rises and cools, water vapour condenses to form clouds and this can lead to rains. Most vul- nerable re- gion Weather systems formed over the Bay of Bengal in the peak of summer in May are among the strongest in the North Indian Ocean region. Threats Can lead to individual hazards such as storm surge, flooding, extreme winds, tornadoes and lighting → loss of life and material dam- age. How are cyclones named? • They are named by the regional specialized mete- orological centres (RSMCs) and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs). • There are six RSMCs in the world and five TCWCs. • As an RSMC, the IMD names the cyclones develop- ing over the north Indian Ocean, including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. • The IMD is also mandated to issue advisories to 12 other countries in the region on the development of cyclones and storms. WMO/ESCAP (World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific): • In 2000, the group (comprising Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand), decided to start naming cyclones in the region. • After each country sent in suggestions, the WMO/ ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones (PTC) finalized the list.

DEEP OCEAN CURRENTS IN ANTARCTI- CA ARE SLOWING DOWN Context: The deep ocean currents (called ‘Overturning Circulations’) in Antarctica, which play a crucial role in redistributing heat, carbon, and nutrients around the globe, are slowing down earlier than predicted (as per the new research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change) Finding: • Overturning circulation has slowed by almost a third (30%) and deep ocean oxygen levels are declining. • These changes were expected by 2050, but are al- ready happening What are the Overturning Circulations? Overturning Circulations refers to the global network of ocean currents that redistribute heat, carbon, and nutrients. They play a crucial role in regulating Earth’s climate, main- taining oxygen levels, and shaping ocean currents. Why are the Overturning Circulations slowing? The Overturning Circulations are slowing due to melting Antarctic ice, which freshens surface waters and reduces their density, hindering the sinking process and disrupting Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 21 the circulation pattern. Impact of ‘the Slowing’: • It can lead to reduced oxygen levels in the deep ocean, affecting marine organisms. • Disrupts the base of the food chain: As the Southern Ocean supports about three-quarters of global phytoplankton production → impacts the marine ecosystem. • It can also intensify global warming by reducing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon dioxide and heat. • It can contribute to rising sea levels due to the ther- mal expansion of warmer waters. About Deep Water Circulations (DWC): Deep Water Circulation (DWC) About DWC refers to the movement of water in the deep ocean, driven by density differ- ences caused by temperature and salinity variations. Formation In polar regions, sea ice formation causes surrounding seawater to become saltier and denser, leading to sinking. The process repeats as surface water is pulled in to re- place sinking water. This circulation pattern is known as thermohaline circulation. Significance Heat Distribution; Carbon Dioxide Control; Shapes ocean currents and circulation pat- terns globally; Affects sea level by redistrib- uting heat and influencing thermal expan- sion Deep-Water Circulations in the Indian Ocean The Indian Ocean does not produce its own deep water; it receives it from other sourc- es like the North Atlantic and the Antarctic.

GLOBAL SLAVERY INDEX 2023 Context: According to the Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery In- dex 2023, 50 million people are living in conditions of mod- ern slavery - a 25% rise over the last five years. Modern slavery: • It refers to situations of exploitation in that a per- son cannot refuse or leave because of threats, vi- olence, coercion, or deception. • It manifests as forced labour, child labour, forced marriage, debt bondage, commercial sexual ex- ploitation, human trafficking, etc. The Global Slavery Index: • It is an assessment of modern slavery conditions in 160 countries. • It uses data released by the International Labour Or- ganisation (ILO), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), etc. • The Index provides rankings across 3 dimensions: Size of the problem (prevalence), Government re- sponse and Vulnerability (political instability, in- equality). • The 2023 index is significant as India holds the G20 presidency this year, with a focus on sustainable de- velopment and climate change mitigation. Highlights of the Global Slavery Index 2023: • 50 million people were living in conditions of mod- ern slavery on any given day in 2021. • The practice has become more prevalent over the last five years (a 25%/10 million rise), due to cli- mate change, armed conflict, weak governance and COVID-19. • G20 nations account for more than half of all peo- ple living in modern slavery because their trade op- erations and global supply chains allow for human rights abuses. The situation within G20 nations: India tops the list with 11 million people working as forced labourers, followed by Chi- na, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey and the U.S. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 22 Case of India Vulnerable popu- lation Indigenous communities and those engaged in fishing and agriculture in States like Odisha and West Bengal have become victims of debt bond- age, human trafficking and mass dis- placement. India’s Stance on modern slavery • The Bonded Labour Abolition Act 1976. • A Central Scheme for Rehabilita- tion of Bonded Labour. • According to the SC, non-payment of minimum wages amounts to “forced labour” under Article 23 of the Constitution. Challenges • Poor implementation of laws due to corruption, apathy, legal loop- holes and lack of political will. • India’s new Labour Codes (which are yet to be implemented) may give “legal sanction” to forced labour by extending work hours and diluting the social security of people working in the organised and unorganised sectors. • No data on people stuck in mod- ern slavery: India’s last nation- al survey of bonded labour was done in the mid-90s. Best practice States like Tamil Nadu have initiated plans to conduct a survey; Challenges: • SDG 8.7 [ending forced labour and modern slavery]: High prevalence of modern slavery and stagnating gov- ernment action highlight the difficulty in achieving this goal by 2030. • Sectors of the economy promote modern slavery: Like the textile industry promotes conditions of forced and unpaid work, lack of benefits (maternity leave), etc. • Poor govt policies: For example, the “Sumangali” scheme in Tamil Nadu traps women and girls from mar- ginalised locations to work in exploitative conditions in spinning mills. Way ahead: • South-south cooperation to bring more transparency in value chains, social security for workers at all stages, and holding corporations accountable in multilateral and bi- lateral free trade agreements. • Implementing stronger measures and legislations that prevent governments and businesses from sourcing goods and services linked to modern slavery. • Embedding anti-slavery measures in climate change sustainability plans. • Providing primary and secondary education to children and tightening regulations around forced and child mar- riage. Conclusion: ● Strong legislation and accountability of G20 nations must be ensured to empower vulnerable communi- ties. ● The road to preventing forced labour goes through the right of access to public goods, global commons and decent work. 14. GLOBAL REPORT ON INTERNAL DIS- PLACEMENT 2023 (GRID-2023) Key Highlights of the Report: Highlight Details Total Number of IDPs Over 71million IDPs across 110 countries and territories at the end of 2022, a 20% increase in a year Total IDPs in India Over 6 lakh were from conflict and violence while 32 thousand were due to disasters Weather-Related Displacements 98% of disaster displacements in 2022 were triggered by weather-re- lated events; floods and storms caused 6 out of 10 disaster displace- ments Pakistan and India Pakistan had the highest number of disaster displacements in 2022, followed by China and Afghanistan, while India ranked fourth Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 23 La Niña’s Influence The prolonged three-year La Niña phenomenon contributed to the rise in weather-related disasters, espe- cially floods, leading to widespread disasters across the globe Regional Displace- ment Patterns Sub-Saharan Africa experienced the highest-ever displacement due to disasters in 2022.

(UPSC 2016) GS PAPER 2 FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNION AND THE STATES, IS- SUES AND CHALLENGES PERTAINING TO THE FEDERAL STRUCTURE 1. CONSTITUTION BENCH VERDICT IN SHIV SENA CASE Context: The Supreme Court of India has passed a unanimous verdict on various issues related to the split in Shiv Sena in June 2022. Background of the issue: In 2019, Uddhav Thackeray became the Chief Minister of Maharashtra leading the MVA alliance. In 2022, Eknath Shinde and other MLAs went missing, claiming no confi- dence in the MVA alliance and Thackeray. The Thackeray group initiated disqualification proceedings against them, and Mr Shinde moved the Supreme Court to dispute it. The Governor directed a floor test to see if Thackeray’s govern- ment still had support, and Uddhav Thackeray resigned without facing it. Later, the Election Commission of India allotted the name Shiv Sena and party symbol to Shinde’s faction, and Thackeray’s side argued that they must be dis- qualified as their actions amounted to defection. Key observations by Supreme Court in the Maharashtra verdict: Observation Explanation Appointment of whip Speaker must recognise the whip and leader authorised by the political par- ty, based on the party constitution, af- ter conducting an inquiry. The power to appoint a whip and a leader rests with the “political party” and not the “legislature party,” as stat- ed in the Tenth Schedule of the Con- stitution. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 24 Legislative wing vs political party Allowing the legislative wing to act independently from the political party contradicts the constitutional system of governance. Disqualification procedure Disqualification ought to be decided as per established procedures in law and the Speaker is the appropriate author- ity for this under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which lays down the anti-defection law. While deciding disqualification pleas, the Speaker must consider the consti- tution of the political party (as submit- ted to ECI) Pending disqual- ification peti- tions The Speaker should decide on pending disqualification petitions in a reason- able timeframe. MLAs have the right to participate in proceedings of the House regardless of the pendency of any petitions for dis- qualification. Floor test A floor test is to be conducted by the Governor only on obtaining objective material to show that the incumbent government had lost the confidence of the House. Governor’s role Then Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was not justified in call- ing for a floor test on June 30, 2022, as he did not have objective material to show that the incumbent government had lost the confidence of the House. The Governor is not empowered to en- ter the political arena and play a role in inter or intra-party disputes. Restoration of the Uddhav gov- ernment The Thackeray group had sought to restore the situation prior to June 29, 2022, but the Supreme Court ruled that it cannot reinstate the Uddhav govern- ment as he had resigned and not faced the floor test. Significance of the judgement: It upholds the principles of constitutional morality and the integrity of the democratic process. Terms Used: “Political party” Vs “Legislature party”: While a political party is an organization of people with common political goals and ideologies, e.g., BJP, Congress; a legislature party is a group of elected representatives of the same political party who coordinate their legisla- tive activities and strategy in the legislature. E.g., elected representatives of BJP in Lok Sabha forms the “legislature party” of BJP in Lok Sabha. What is a Whip? A whip is a party official in charge of ensuring that par- ty members vote in accordance with the party’s position on a particular issue. The concept originated from British Parliament. All parties can issue whips to their members. Parties appoint a senior member from among their House contingents to issue whips — this member is called a chief whip, and he/ she is assisted by additional whips Insta Links • Does the anti-defection law need changes?

DELHI GOVERNMENT CASE VS LG Context: The Supreme Court of India has given the state government of Delhi complete control over administrative services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), except for public order, police, and land. Background of the Issue: The Delhi government and Lieutenant Governor have been in a legal battle since 2015 over control of “services” in Delhi. The Supreme Court gave a split verdict in 2019, and a five-judge Constitution Bench has now delivered its ver- dict on the issue of control and whether officers allocated to Delhi come under the administrative control of the Del- hi government or Delhi LG. The case also included the con- stitutional validity of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act 2021, which referred to the Lieutenant Governor as the “government” in any law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 25 What is the Verdict of the SC? Verdict Powers of LG Lt. Governor shall be bound by the decision of the Delhi government over services, apart from public order, police and land. P o w e r s of Central g o v ern - ment Centre had exclusive legislative and execu- tive control over ‘services’ relating to public order, land and police as envisaged under Article 239AA. Federalism in UT The Centre had argued that the Constitution is a federal Constitution with a strong uni- tary bias as far as UTs are concerned. Contradicting it, SC said that Indian federal- ism is not unitary and any further expansion of the Union’s power will be contrary to the Constitutional scheme. Powers to the elect- ed govern- ment If a democratically elected government is not given the power to control the officers, the principle of the triple chain of account- ability (Political, Administrative and Public accountability) will be redundant. P r inc iple of collec- tive re- sponsibil- ity It extends to the responsibility of officers, who in turn report to the ministers. If the offi- cers stop reporting to the ministers or do not abide by their directions, the entire principle of collective responsibility is affected. The scope of the Court’s verdict: • While interpreting Article 239AA(3)(a), the Court ruled that the Legislative Assembly of the NCTD has jurisdiction over entries in List II (The State list) and List III (The Concurrent list), except three entries in List II (public order, police, and land). • The Union of India has executive power only over these three entries in List II over which the NCTD does not have legislative competence. • Consequently, executive power over “services” (List II) can be exercised exclusively by the Government of the NCTD. How are UTs administered? The Union Territories (UTs) in India are administered by the President through an appointed administrator, who rep- resents the President and exercises administrative powers in the UT. The judiciary in the UTs is governed by the Con- stitution and laws made by the Parliament. In some UTs, such as Delhi and Puducherry, the administrator holds significant powers, including the ability to make laws and regulations for the UT, while in others, the administrator’s powers are limited to providing advice to the elected gov- ernment. Special provision for Delhi UT: Special provisions have been made for certain UTs, such as Puducherry, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir (yet to be constituted), which have a legislative assembly and a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister. The leg- islative assembly of these UTs has the power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution insofar as these matters are applicable in relation to the UT. However, some entries in List II, such as public order, po- lice, and land, are not within the legislative competence of the legislative assembly of Delhi. Quotes used by SC: Quote 1: “The principles of democracy and federalism are essential features of our Constitution and form a part of the basic structure.

THE NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 2023 Context: The President of India exercised legislative power under Ar- ticle 123 of the Constitution to promulgate The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordi- nance, 2023. Need to promulgate the Ordinance: The Ordinance negates the Constitution Bench judgment of the SC, that brought “services” under the Government of National Capital Terri- tory of Delhi (NCTD). Key highlights of the Government of NCTD (Amendment) Ordinance 2023: ● Creation of National Capital Civil Service Authority (NCCSA): ○ It will be headed by the CM of Delhi, with the Chief Secretary and Principal Home Sec- retary of Delhi being the other two mem- bers. ○ It will make recommendations to the Lieu- tenant Governor (LG) regarding the transfer, posting, vigilance and other incidental mat- ters wrt to AISs and DANICS serving the Del- hi government. ○ All matters are required to be decided by a majority of votes. This means that the deci- sion of the elected CM can be overruled by the two senior bureaucrats. ● Role of LG: ○ The L-G will pass orders to give effect to the recommendations passed by the NCCSA. ○ In case the L-G differs from the recommen- dation made, s/he may return the recom- mendation for reconsideration by the NCC- SA. Therefore, the final decision will lie with the LG. Changes brought by the Ordinance: It inserted “services” of List II into Article 239AA(3)(a), thereby expanding the scope of matters (under the control of the Union) from 3 to 4. The Constitutionality of the Ordinance In terms of Article 368 In terms of Articles 141 and 144 The power conferred on Parliament (under Article 239AA) is to make fresh laws for giving effect to or supplementing the provi- sions contained in various clauses of Article 239AA. When a Constitution Bench of the SC declares/inter- prets the law, the same is binding on all courts and authorities in India. Therefore, altering the scope of Article 239AA(3) (a) requires Constitutional Amendment under Article 368. Articles 123, 141, and 144 are in Part V (The Union) of the Constitution. None has a non-obstante clause. Consequently, the ordi- nance promulgated under Article 123 to expand the scope of Article 239AA(3)(a) is liable to be struck down. Therefore, Article 74 could not override Article 144. Conclusion: The Union of India’s decision to prefer review (Article 137) and promulgate an ordinance (Article 123) simultaneously is ill-conceived. Important Articles of the Indian Constitution discussed above Article 74 It provides for a Council of Ministers which shall aid the President in the exercise of the President’s functions. Article 137It deals with the review of judgments or or- ders by the Supreme Court. Article 141It stipulates that the law declared by the Su- preme Court shall be binding on all Courts within the territory of India. Article 144All authorities, civil and judicial, in the terri- tory of India, shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. Article 239 AA The Constitution (69th Amendment) Act, 1991 inserted Article 239 AA in the Constitu- tion, giving special status to Delhi and estab- lishing an Administrator and a Legislative As- sembly. The Assembly has the power to make laws for the NCT of Delhi, except for police, public order, and land. The L-G has dual con- trol and can either act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers or refer a differ- ence of opinion to the President. This power tussle between the elected government and the L-G has been a point of contention. Article 368The Parliament may in the exercise of its con- stituent power amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of the Con- stitution in accordance with the procedure laid down in this article.

POWER TO PROMULGATE/RE-PROMUL- GATE ORDINANCES Ordinance Meaning It is a law enacted by the Executive (President in the case of Union and Governor in the case of State) to meet extraordinary/urgent cir- cumstances. Extraor- d i n a r y / ur g en t cir cum - stances Article 123 of the Indian Constitution empow- ers the President [Article 213 - Governor] to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Par- liament. Arti cl e 123 If at any time, except when both Houses of Parliament are in session, the President is sat- isfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate Ordinances. Real au- t h o ri - ty that d eci d es to bring the Ordi- nance Under Article 74, the President acts on the ad- vice of the Council of Ministers. Hence, it is in effect the government that decides to bring the Ordinance. Effect An Ordinance shall have the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. However, the government is required to bring an Ordinance before Parliament for ratification. Life • If the government fails to get an Ordinance ratified by the Parliament, it will lapse at the expiration of 6 weeks from the reas- sembly of Parliament. Maximum life of an Ordinance = 6 months (recess) + 6 weeks • The Ordinance may lapse earlier - if the President withdraws it or if both Houses pass resolutions disapproving it (imply that the government has lost the majority.) Criticism • As lawmaking is a legislative function, Or- dinance power is provided to meet urgent situations. • However, the governments adopt the Ordi- nance route to bypass the legislature. • Repromulgation of an Ordinance, which extends life of an Ordinance, allows the executive to further seize legislative power. SC verdicts on the issue • RC Cooper Case 1970: If an Ordinance is issued solely to bypass the Parliament, the President’s decision to promulgate the Ordinance can be challenged. • D C Wadhwa v. State of Bihar 1986: If the Govern- ment ignores the legislature and repromulgate an Or- dinance, it would be a colourable exercise of power. • Krishna Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar 2017: A sev- en-judge Bench of the SC held that the satisfaction of the President under Article 123 is not immune from judicial scrutiny; not a parallel source of law-making or an independent legislative authority. It reiterat- ed that the Governor’s power to issue an Ordinance is in the nature of an emergency power. Repeated re-promulgations without bringing the Ordinance to the legislature would be unconstitutional. Insta Links: The ordinance route is bad, repromulgation worse Mains Links: Q. Resorting to ordinances has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation of powers doctrine.

WATER DISPUTE BETWEEN ANDHRA PRADESH AND TELANGANA Context: The water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, stemming from the Krishna River, remains unresolved even after 9 years since the bifurcation of the combined state. About the Dispute: The dispute began with the erstwhile Hyderabad and My- sore states and later continued between successors Maha- rashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It originated from the Gentlemen’s Agreement signed in 1956, which aimed to protect the Telangana region’s interests regarding wa- ter resources. In 1969, the Krishna Water Disputes Tribu- nal (KWDT) was set up under the Inter-State River Water Dispute Act, of 1956, and presented its report in 1973. It di- vided water between Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. After the bifurcation of the state, both states have proposed new projects (e.g., the project to increase Krishna water www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 28 utilization above the Srisailam Reservoir) without proper clearance from river boards and authorities as required by the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. This led to complaints and disputes between the two states. Also, Tel- angana has been pushing for an equal share. Legal Provisions: The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 mandates for the constitution of an Apex Council by the Central Govern- ment for the supervision of the functioning of the Godavari River Management Board and Krishna River Management Board. The Apex Council comprises the Union Water Re- sources Minister and the Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Constitutional provisions: Inter-State River Water Disputes: Under Article 262, Parlia- ment may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute or complaint with respect to the use, distribution and con- trol of waters of any inter-state river and river valley. The Par- liament enacted two laws, the River Boards Act (1956) and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act (1956). About River board: The River Boards Act provides for the establishment of river boards by the Central government for the regulation and development of inter-state rivers and river valleys. A River Board is established at the request of state governments concerned to advise them. About Inter-State Water Disputes Act: It empowers the Central government to set up an ad hoc tribunal for the adjudication of a dispute between two or more states in relation to the waters of an inter-state river or river valley. The decision of the tribunal is final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court is to have jurisdiction in respect of any water dispute which may be referred to such a tribunal un- der this Act. Way forward: To address water disputes effectively, it is necessary to es- tablish a permanent tribunal with Supreme Court’s appel- late jurisdiction and amend Article 262 and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act. Communication channels must be im- proved for consensus-building, and the central body should represent states adequately. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has issued a gazette notification defining the jurisdiction of river management boards, which can help overcome challenges. Clear demarcation of power for each state should be fol- lowed.

INDIA’S NEW PARLIAMENT: NEED AND SIGNIFICANCE Context: • In the 75th year of Independence, India’s new Par- liament building, embodying the culture, pride and spirit of the entire nation, was recently inaugurated by the PM of India. • 19 opposition parties boycotted the inauguration event, accusing the central government of sidelining President Droupadi Murmu - the country’s first tribal head of state. The old Parliament: • At the coronation of George V as Emperor of India in 1911, the announcement of the transfer of the seat of GoI from Calcutta to the ancient Capital of Delhi www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 30 was made. • The GoI Act 1919 provided for a bicameral legisla- ture for India and the need for the new was felt. • The parliament building’s construction took six years (and Rs 83 lakhs) - from 1921 to 1927, and its circu- lar shape is believed to be inspired by the Chausath Yogini temple at Mitawli village in MP’s Morena dis- trict. Need for a new Parliament building: ● Existing Parliament is old: The existing Parliament house (which will be converted into a ‘Museum of Democracy’ after the new Parliament becomes op- erational) is almost a century-old Heritage Grade-I building, showing signs of distress and over-utiliza- tion. ● Narrow seating space for MPs: ○ The present building was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy. ○ The Central Hall has seating capacity only for 440 persons and when the Joint Ses- sions are held, the problem of limited seats amplifies. ○ The number of Lok Sabha seats is likely to increase significantly from the current 545 after 2026. ● Distressed infrastructure: The addition of services like water supply, sewer lines, etc., has led to seep- age of water at several places and impacted the aes- thetics of the building. ● Safety concerns: For example, fire safety, structural safety (Delhi is currently in Seismic Zone-IV), etc. ● Obsolete communication structures: Communica- tions infrastructure and technology is antiquated in the existing Parliament, and the acoustics of all the halls need improvement. ● Inadequate workspace for employees. The new Parliament: • It is part of the Central Vista Project - the ongoing redevelopment project to revamp India’s central administrative area (designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker during British colonial rule) located near Raisina Hill, New Delhi. • It is designed by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management under architect Bimal Patel and has been built by Tata Projects Ltd. Main features of the new Parliament building: • A “Platinum-rated Green Building” with about 65,000 sq m built-up area, which will be divyang friendly. • The triangular shape ensures the optimum utilisa- tion of space. • A larger Lok Sabha hall (888 seats) based on the peacock theme (India’s national bird) and a larg- er Rajya Sabha hall (384 seats) based on the lotus theme (India’s national flower). • The Lok Sabha may accommodate up to 1,272 seats for joint sessions of Parliament. • A state-of-the-art Constitutional Hall symbolically and physically puts the Indian citizens at the heart of our democracy. • A Central Lounge that will complement the open courtyard (with a banyan - the national tree) will be a place for members to interact with each other. • Ultra-modern state-of-the-art features like a digi- tised voting system, well-engineered acoustics and audiovisual systems in the two chambers. Interior decorations: • Murals depicting maps of ancient India-protected monuments of ASI and UNESCO, etc. • 3 ceremonial entrance halls with huge brass imag- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 31 es of Mahatma Gandhi, Chanakya, Gargi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, B.R.

Expectations from the new Parliament: • The trend of increasing disruptions and long peri- ods of deadlock is antithetical to the spirit of Parlia- ment - law-making through debate, discussion, and consensus. • Hence, the new Parliament offers an opportunity to seriously introspect on Parliamentary conduct and make Parliament more efficient and productive. Conclusion: The new Parliament should not only be the fountainhead/ epitome of architectural excellence but should also work as a lighthouse to guide India in its ambitious journey of ‘new India@100’; ‘Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat’, etc. STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND VAR- IOUS QUASI-JUDICIAL BODIES. 5.

Now, the government has again extended the tenure of Mr Mishra citing a pending review by the Financial Action Task Force and that Mishra would not remain in service after his term comes to an end in November. This has been chal- lenged in SC again. Issues with ED and PMLA: Issue Example Misuse of PMLA for or- dinary crimes PMLA is used to investigate crimes not related to money laundering or organized crime, leading to the attachment of assets of genuine victims. Lack of trans- parency and clarity The Enforcement Case Information Re- port (ECIR) is not given to the accused and the ED lacks clarity in selecting cases to investigate. Blanket pow- ers The ED has been assigned almost blanket powers under PMLA for searching, seiz- ing, investigating, and attaching assets considered to be proceeds of crime. Low convic- tion rate Between 2005 and 2013-14, there were zero convictions, and between 2014-15 and 2021-22, only 23 cases were under conviction out of 888 cases registered. Allegation of Political bias- es “Political figures who have crossed over to the government side have mysteriously been given ‘clean chits’ or have seen ED go slow in proceedings against them” Way forward: While the ED has been given expansive powers under PMLA, there must be a balance between these powers and adher- ence to constitutional provisions to prevent political misuse. The process of investigation should not become a punish- ment, and there should be a commitment to expeditiously resolve cases for speedy trials and convictions. Constant scrutiny over the operations of the Enforcement Directorate is necessary, and any lacunas in the operative part can be filled through suitable legislation, executive ac- tion, or a revised order of the apex court.

GANHRI: ● Formerly known as the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), GAHNRI is a global network of NHRIs. ● It is constituted as a non-profit entity (under Swiss law) and Secretariat support is provided by the Of- fice of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). ● It coordinates the relationship between NHRIs and the UN human rights system. The Paris Principles: ● They were defined in 1991 and were adopted by the UN Human Rights Commission (1992) and the UN General Assembly (1993). ● They provide the international benchmarks against which NHRI can be accredited. ● They set out 6 main criteria that NHRIs are re- quired to meet. These are: ○ mandate and competence; ○ autonomy from the government; ○ independence guaranteed by a statute or Constitution; ○ pluralism; ○ adequate resources; and ○ adequate powers of investigation. Importance of GANHRI accreditation: ● Institutions accredited with “A status” means full compliance with the Paris Principles. ● It is the only non-UN body whose internal accredita- tion system grants access to UN committees - speak- ing rights and seating at human rights treaty bodies. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 33 NHRC-India About It is a statutory body established on 12 Octo- ber 1993 (in conformity with the Paris Princi- ples), under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA) 1993 [Amended in 2019]. Objective A watchdog for the promotion and protec- tion of the human rights of citizens of India. The PHRA defines Human Rights as the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India.

ARTICLE 142 Context: The Supreme Court of India has ruled that it can directly grant divorce to couples under Article 142 (1) of the Consti- tution, which allows it to do “complete justice” in any cause or matter. What did SC say? The court can waive the mandatory six-month waiting peri- od for divorce under The Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), 1955, and allow the dissolution of the marriage on grounds of an irretrievable breakdown even if one of the parties is not willing. Significance of the decision: The decision enables couples to bypass the time-consuming process of obtaining a decree of www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 34 divorce through family courts, which have a large number of similar cases pending. About Article 142: Topic Information Article 142 (1) provides discretionary power to the Su- preme Court as it states that the SC in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or mat- ter pending before it. Application Release of AG Perarivalan, one of the life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassi- nation case; Cleansing of Taj Mahal and granting justice to many undertrials; Ayodhya dispute case Significance It has been invoked to protect the rights of different sections of the pop- ulation and serves as a check on the government, acting as a system of checks and balances with the legis- lature. It provides complete justice to various deprived sections of society or protects the environment Example of judi- cial overreach Ban on the sale of alcohol along na- tional and state highways where the court extended the ban to State high- ways as well Negative Impact Article 142 has some negative aspects such as ambiguity, promoting judicial overreach, and unaccountability. The phrase “complete justice” is still un- clear and judgments passed by the Su- preme Court have created confusion. 8. JUDICIAL RECUSALS Context: Calling it an attempt to indulge in ‘bench hunting’, a former SC judge refused to recuse himself from hearing a plea. What is recusal? • It is the act of declining to take part in an official ac- tivity, such as a court case because the administra- tive or court authority presiding over it has a conflict of interest. • This conflict of interest can arise in many ways - from holding shares in a litigant company to having a prior or personal association with a party. The practice of judicial recusals stems from: • The cardinal principles of due process of law: \t Nemo judex in sua causa - no person shall be a judge in his own case. \t Justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. • The oath of office: Both the SC and HC judges prom- ise to perform their duties without fear or favour, af- fection or ill-will, in accordance with the III Schedule of the Constitution. • Restatement of the Values of Judicial Life adopted by the SC: It forbids a judge from deciding a case where he holds pecuniary interest unless the con- cerned parties clarify that they have no objections. Recent instances of judicial recusals: • In the afore-mentioned case involving a former IPS officer (Sanjiv Bhat), recusal was sought on the ground that there was a likelihood of bias since the same Judge, a Gujarat HC judge had reprimanded the IPS officer. • The CJI rejected an application seeking his recusal from hearing petitions seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages. • Justice Gita Gopi of the Gujarat HC recused herself from hearing Rahul Gandhi’s appeal seeking a stay on his conviction in the criminal defamation case. Why do judges recuse? • To prevent the perception that the judge was biased while deciding a case. • When an appeal is filed in the SC against an HC judg- ment delivered by the concerned judge before his elevation. What is the procedure for recusal? • Although several SC judgments have dealt with the issue, India has no codified rules governing recusals. • There are two kinds of recusals - automatic (where a judge himself withdraws from the case) or when a party raises a plea for recusal. • The decision to recuse rests solely on the conscience and discretion of the judge and no party can compel a judge to withdraw from a case. • If a judge recuses himself, the case is listed before the Chief Justice for allotment to an alternate Bench. Do judges have to record reasons for recusal? Since there are no statutory rules governing the process, it is often left to the judges themselves to record reasons for recusals. Concerns: • The majority of the time, the grounds for recusal are not made public, which endangers judicial transpar- ency. • However, the Delhi HC recently ruled that any inves- tigation into the reasons for recusal would consti- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 35 tute an interference with the course of justice. Rules formulated by the SC in the past: ● Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India (1987): To deter- mine if a judge should recuse, what is relevant is the reasonableness of the apprehension of bias in the mind of the concerned party. ● State of West Bengal v. Shivananda Pathak (1998): Judicial bias is a condition of mind which renders the judge incapable of impartiality in a particular case. ● SC Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (2015): Where a judge has a pecuniary in- terest, no further inquiry is needed to establish whether there is a ‘real danger’ of bias. ● Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and Ors (2019): Merely having a legal opinion does not disentitle one from being impartial. Practice in foreign jurisdictions: • The United States has a well-defined law on recus- als, which details the grounds for recusal - financial or corporate interest, a case in which the judge was a material witness or a lawyer, and a relationship to a party. • The United Kingdom’s law laid down a standard to look at the likelihood of bias from the perspective of a fair-minded and reasonable observer. Conclusion: • It is the judge’s ‘constitutional duty’ to be ‘transpar- ent and accountable’ and therefore reasons must be indicated for recusal (Justice Kurien Joseph). • There is a need for ‘procedural and substantive rules to deal with the growing frequency of recusal pleas (Justice Madan Lokur). The practice of “bench hunting” refers to petitioners at- tempting to have their cases heard by a specific judge or court in order to obtain a favourable order. 9. JALLIKATTU, KAMBALA CAN GO ON IN TAMIL NADU AND KARNATAKA: SC Context: A five-judge Bench of the SC upheld the amendments made by TN, Maharashtra and Karnataka to The Prevention of Cru- elty to Animals (PCA) Act 1960, allowing bull-taming sports like Jallikattu, Kambala, and bullock-cart races. What is Jallikattu/eruthazhuvuthal? • It is a bull-taming sport traditionally played in TN as part of the Pongal harvest festival and as a celebra- tion of nature, of which cattle worship is a part. • However, it has long been contested over cruelty to animals and the bloody and dangerous nature of the sport. Background of the case: W el f a r e Board of India v. A. Nag ar aja 2014 A two-judge Bench of the SC banned such sports including Jallikattu. • The apex court held “bovine sports” contrary to the PCA Act - fixes the du- ties of persons in charge of animals and defines animal cruelty. • The PCA Act overrides the so-called tra- dition and culture and the Parliament must elevate the rights of animals to that of constitutional rights (under Arti- cles 14, 21). MoEF C C no tifi c a - tion, 2016 It prohibited the “exhibition or training of bulls as performing animals”. However, an exception specified that bulls might still be trained as performing animals at Jallikattu, according to the customs and culture of different communities. TN amend- ed the PCA Act in 2017 • This was done to allow Jallikattu in the state, to preserve the cultural her- itage of TN, to ensure the survival and well-being of the native breeds of bulls, and to minimize cruelty to animals in the concerned sports • A batch of petitions were filed chal- lenging the above exemption and the amendments, following which the SC referred the matter to the Constitution Bench, as the issue involved the interpretation of the Constitution. • The Bench was tasked with decid- ing whether Jallikattu could be pre- served as the cultural right of TN under Article 29(1) of the Constitu- tion. The recent verdict of the SC: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 36 • It overruled its 2014 ruling in ‘Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja’ and held that Jallikattu has a strong cul- tural component. • The amendments (to the PCA) were “valid legisla- tions”, as these are not a piece of colourable legisla- tion and that it relates to List III of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution [prevention of cruelty to animals]. • The court also said that the 2017 amendment does not violate - \t Articles 51-A (g) and 51-A (h), which im- pose duties on Indian citizens to protect the environment and develop a scientific temper, humanism, spirit of inquiry, and reform, respectively. \t Articles 14 (Right to Equality) and 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution. • However, the Jallikattu issue is “debatable” and must ultimately be decided by the Parliament, as the issue requires social and cultural analysis in greater detail.

The Criminal Justice System (CJS) in India is a set of legal and institutional frameworks that govern the detection, inves- tigation, prosecution, and punishment of criminal offences. • The CJS in India is mainly guided by three major legal documents: \t The Indian Penal Code \t The Code of Criminal Procedure \t The Indian Evidence Act. CJS has four subsystems: \t Legislature (Parliament) \t Enforcement (Police) \t Adjudication (Courts) \t Corrections (Prisons, Community Facilities) Need for new Prison Act: Examples/Facts Ou t d a t ed laws The Indian Prison Act was enacted in 1894 and amended several times, but it fails to address modern-day prison challenges. Human rights violations E.g., custodial deaths, torture, and over- crowding are widespread in Indian pris- ons. Focus on re- habilitation The current prison system focuses more on punishment than rehabilitation, which leads to high recidivism rates (committing offence again). A new act should emphasize the need for rehabilitation programs and better in- tegration of prisoners into society upon release. I mp r o v ed healthcare Many Indian prisons lack adequate health- care facilities, leading to higher mortality rates. Tech n o l o gy integration The current prison system is largely man- ual and paper-based, leading to delays and inefficiencies. Overcrowding According to the latest data available from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the occupancy rate of Indian pris- ons is over 117%, indicating severe over- crowding. Staff training Many Indian prison staff lack adequate training, leading to incidents of human rights abuses, corruption, and misman- agement. E.g., In 2020 it was reported that the Pu- zhal Central Prison in Chennai, Tamil Nadu had only one guard for every 100 prisoners. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 37 Previous other recommendations: SC appointed Justice Amitava Roy (retd.) The committee recommended several measures to address the issue includ- ing: • Speedy trials • Increasing the number of lawyers for prisoners • Setting up special fast-track courts for petty offences • Promoting the concept of plea bargaining Initiative for prison reforms in India: The Modernisation of Prisons Project (2021-26) aims to enhance security and facilitate prisoner rehabilitation in India through the use of modern security equipment; E-Prisons Project, Model Prison Manual 2016, and National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). Conclusion: The Model Prison Act 2023 is aimed at improving prison administration and conditions, protecting the rights of pris- oners, and promoting their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It is expected to bring much-needed reforms to the Indian prison system and align it with international stan- dards. Insta Links: Prison Reforms in India Mains Links: Q.

GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS RPWD ACT 2016 Context: The Government of India has implemented the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act 2016 to establish ac- cessibility standards for persons with disabilities. What are accessibility standards for persons with disabili- ties? Accessibility standards for persons with disabilities refer to guidelines and regulations that aim to ensure equal access and participation for individuals with disabilities in various environments and services. These standards cover different aspects of accessibility—Physical environment, transporta- tion, information and communication, technology, and pub- lic facilities. Status of Persons with Disabilities in India: There are about 2.68 crore (2.21% of the population) peo- ple with disabilities in India according to the 2011 census of India. About the Accessibility standards for persons with disabil- ities: Aspect Accessibility Standards Aim Provide access to medical services for per- sons with disabilities—Preventive, curative and rehabilitative.

LABOUR DAY Context: May 1 is widely known as Labour Day/International Work- er’s Day - a day to celebrate the contribution of workers worldwide. Background: • The origin of Labour Day dates back to the 19th cen- tury - when a nationwide strike of 1886 for an eight- hour workday culminated in a violent movement in Chicago, US. • In 1889, the International Socialist Conference de- clared May 1 would be an international holiday for labour/May Day/Labour Day/Workers Day. • In India, the first Labour Day (initiated by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan) was celebrated on May 1, 1923, in Madras. The primary objective of Labour Day: • To acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the working class, • Create awareness about their rights, and • Protect them from exploitation. Current trends in the labour market worldwide: Three years after the COVID-19, • Small and micro-enterprises/people have been hard hit by inflation • Lack of opportunities • Real wages have fallen, and poverty inequality is rising Indian labour market - Major issues: • Surplus labour force: Without the commensurate rise in job opportunities in the labour market. • Unskilled labour force: Leading to a rise in indecent/ poor quality jobs like manual scavenging, etc. \t For example, 8 people died in Gujarat (in April 2023) while cleaning sewers, despite the practice being declared illegal across the country. • Low absorption of skilled labour • Labour market imperfections: Such as lack of ade- quate information regarding jobs, numerous labour laws, etc. • The workers in the unorganised sector: Constitute about 93% of the total workforce in the country → not covered under social security measures → most affected during COVID-19 pandemic. • Unemployment: Causing problems like disguised unemployment, seasonal unemployment, open un- employment and educated unemployment. • Son of the soil doctrine: For example, Haryana en- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 39 acted a new law reserving 75% of private sector jobs with monthly salaries up to ₹30,000 for locals. Labour reforms Global • The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a UN agency to advance social and eco- nomic justice by setting international labour standards. • In 1919, the ILO adopted the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention (British India ratified in 1921), limiting the number of working hours to eight a day and 48 hours a week. • The Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) re- stated the traditional objectives of the ILO and highlighted two new directions: the cen- trality of human rights to social policy, and the need for international economic plan- ning. India • Labour falls under the Concurrent List of the Constitution. • The central government replaced the 29 ex- isting labour laws with four Codes. • These Codes regulate (i) Wages, (ii) Industrial Relations, (iii) Social Security, and (iv) Occu- pational Safety, Health and Working Condi- tions. • eShram: This portal will help build a compre- hensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW) in the country. • PM Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM): Meant for old age protection and social secu- rity of Unorganised workers. • Aam Admi Bima Yojana: Providing social se- curity to unorganised sector workers. How to prioritise social justice for a sustainable and stable future? • Policies and actions must be human-centred. • Focusing on ‘decent work’: The most effective way to reduce inequality, and poverty and ensure social protection is a ‘Decent Work for All’ - SDG 8. • Addressing the long-term structural transforma- tions: By ensuring that new technology creates and supports employment, and skills training, treating demographic changes/migration as a ‘dividend’. • Reinvigorate labour institutions and organisations: To make social dialogue effective and vigorous. • Review laws and regulations: To make them up-to- date - protecting workers and supporting sustain- able businesses. • Creating a global platform: To recommit to inter- national cooperation and solidarity and to create greater policy coherence, a Global Coalition for So- cial Justice is needed. Conclusion: Social justice should be the keystone of labour reforms at the level of national, regional and global policies and actions. This will help in achieving equitable and resilient societies.

MISLEADING FOOD ADS AND REGULA- TIONS TO CURTAIL THEM Context: The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has flagged 32 new cases of misleading advertisements and claims made by food business operators. • FSSAI has referred the cases to licensing authorities and warned that offenders face penalties of up to INR 10 lakh or suspension or cancellation of licens- es for repeated offences. What are misleading advertisements? Misleading advertisements are those that make false or ex- aggerated claims about a product or service with the inten- tion of deceiving consumers. Examples of misleading advertisements: Company Misleading Claim Detox Tea Co. “Lose 10 lbs in 7 days with our tea” Beauty Products Inc. “Eliminates wrinkles in one day” Bourn Vita “Our drink is low in sugar” (when it contains high sugar content) Fresh Teeth Inc. “Whitens teeth 10 shades in one use” Hair Care Co. “Regrows hair in 2 weeks” Social Networking Inc. “100% safe and secure” www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 40 Impact of misleading advertisement: Examples Loss of Customer Trust Volkswagen used deceptive advertising to market their diesel cars as environmentally friendly, causing damage to the environment and a loss of trust in the company by custom- ers.

Tags given to packaged foods: Tag Description Example Natural A food product that is a single food derived from a recog- nized natural source and has nothing added to it. Packaging must be done without chemi- cals and preservatives. Fresh fruits and vegetables Fresh The term “fresh” can only be used for food products that have been washed, peeled, chilled, trimmed, or cut with- out any other processing that alters its basic characteristics. If food is processed in any way to extend its shelf life, it can- not be labelled as “fresh.” Freshly baked bread, freshly squeezed juice Pure “Pure” is to be used for sin- gle-ingredient foods to which nothing has been added, and the unavoidable contami- nants are within prescribed controls. Pure honey, pure maple syrup Original “Original” is used to describe food products made to a for- mulation, with a traceable origin that has remained un- changed over time. Original recipe potato chips N u t ri - tional Claims Nutritional claims in food ad- vertisements can be about the specific contents of a product or comparisons with another food item. “High in pro- tein”, “Low in sugar” Conclusion: To improve food safety in India, companies should provide evidence to support their claims and modify advertise- ments for better consumer understanding. FSSAI and state food authorities should conduct surveys to ensure better enforcement and administration of the FSS Act. Compen- sation and fines should be increased in cases of injury or death, and more food testing laboratories should be estab- lished.

LAW TO RECALL BAD DRUGS Context: India has not implemented a law to recall bad drugs from the market since 1976, even though discussions have taken place on this topic several times over the years. What is a drug recall? A drug recall is the process of removing a prescription or over-the-counter drug from the market. A recall may occur if a medication is found to be defective, contaminated, or potentially harmful to the public. Drug regulation in India: In India, drugs and cosmetics are regulated by: • Act: Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules 1945: It assigns various responsibilities to central and state reg- ulators. • Agencies: • Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI): It is respon- sible for approving licenses for specified categories of drugs, setting standards for manufacturing, sales, im- port, and distribution of drugs in India, and heads the department of CDSCO. • Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO): It prescribes standards for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs, cosmetics, diagnostics, and devic- es. It also regulates the market authorization of new drugs and clinical trial standards. • National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA): It controls the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs in India Why India doesn’t have a law for drug recall? Reasons Explanation Apathy and Lack of Expertise The government’s drug regulatory bod- ies give more importance to promoting the growth of the pharma industry than restricting their activities. Moreover, they lack expertise in drug regulation (as USA FDA has) www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 42 Fr a gmen t ed R egula t or y Structure India has a highly fragmented regulato- ry structure, with each state having its own drug regulator. Opposition to Centralized Reg- ulatory Both the pharmaceutical industry and state drug regulators have resist- ed greater centralization of regulatory powers. They fear that a central regula- tor could slow down the growth of the industry. No Interest in Government There appears to be no sustained de- mand from civil society for reform, and the government is more invested in the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. Impact of substandard drugs: Impact Example Adverse health effects In 2022, the World Health Organization linked the deaths of almost 60 children in Gambia to substandard cough syrups manufactured in India. Loss of trust in the healthcare system In 2019, the case of supplying substan- dard and falsified antiretroviral drugs to the government in South Africa. Economic losses for patients and the healthcare system Patients may have to spend more mon- ey on healthcare due to the need for additional treatments and hospitaliza- tions. Legal and reg- ulatory con- sequences for manufacturers In 2021, a firm was seized in Agra City (UP) for purchasing expired drugs at low costs and reselling them with new packaging. The company may face legal consequences for these actions. Way forward: To create an effective recall mechanism, the responsibility of recalling drugs needs to be centralized under one authority with the legal power to hold companies liable for failures to recall drugs and search and seize batches of failed medicine.

AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF MEDICINE Context: The ICMR under the Union Health Ministry and the Union Ministry of Ayush has agreed to enhance cooperation in health research in the field of integrated medicine. An integrated system of medicine/complementary med- icine Meaning It means a conjoint study, training and practice in indigenous/traditional medicine (ayurveda, Unani, etc) and modern (allopa- thy) medicine. Why do pa- tients favour complemen- tary medi- cine? 5 barriers(5As) to healthcare: awareness, access, acceptability, affordability, and ac- countability. Complementary medicine gives people with chronic diseases who have already tried a number of things an option. That is why, 50% of people use complementary medicine, and more than 70% have used it at some point during their lifetime. Concerns No evidence-based benefits of comple- mentary medicine, lack of data on safety and efficacy, and a lack of standardization of formulations. Integrative medicine is a business: Data shows that it increases the cost of care and does not improve the patient’s clinical out- comes. Efforts to p r o mo t e complemen- tary medi- cine in India The National Integrated Medical Associ- ation (NIMA) is an Indian NGO of general practitioners educated in integrated system of medicine. The National Ayush Mission (launched in 2014) has played a crucial role in preserving and promoting India’s traditional systems of medicine and their integration into the mainstream healthcare system. WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medi- cine (Jamnagar, Gujarat) was set up to pro- mote Traditional Medicines as a system of treatment for various ailments. CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medi- cine is a premier institute located in Jam- mu and dedicated to the research of drug discovery. Some universities in India offer BISM (Bach- elor in Integrated System of Medicine) What is the agreement between ICMR and the Ministry of Ayush: The two-day National Ayush Mission Conclave talks about the practice at AIIMS and research in complementary medicine. Significance of the move: ● It will enhance the treatments that can be offered under one roof. ● It will help build harmonized protocols for clinical care research, and this is especially important for non-communicable diseases, where medical treat- ment options are limited. ● It will take Ayurveda and yoga to the world. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 43 Way ahead: Randomised control trials (RCTs) and peer-reviewed studies of traditional medicine must be promoted. Conclusion: Many systems of medicine have a role to play in keeping hu- man beings well. Modern medicine is extremely important, but there is a wealth of wisdom and ancient traditions which can be incorporated sensibly and safely for the well-being of man.

INDIA@100: RESOLVING THE TRIBAL HEALTH CHALLENGE Context: As India celebrates its achievements, it must build a health- care system that caters to tribal communities. Since independence, India has made remarkable strides: • As the world’s 5th-largest economy and a leader in the digital realm. • Demonstrating the ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutum- bakam - One World, One Family. \t For example, through its Vaccine Maitri ini- tiative, India provided over 60 million vac- cine doses to nations across the world. Challenges: • Equitable, affordable and quality healthcare for 1.4 billion people. • Finding a way to achieve this without disrupting the identities of tribals. Healthcare issues faced by Tribal communities in India: • They constitute 8.9% of the population and remain the most neglected and deprived group when it comes to access to healthcare. • For example, the mortality rate in tribal areas is 44% higher than the national average, and infant mortality is 63% higher [Ministry of Tribal Affairs]. Reasons behind poor health indicators among tribals: They face multifaceted challenges - lack of infrastructure, medical professionals, connectivity, affordability, equip- ment, insurance, funding, etc. Health schemes in tribal areas: • The National Health Mission (NHM): It envisages the achievement of universal access to equitable, afford- able and quality healthcare services that are account- able and responsive to people’s needs. • Various initiatives supported under the NHM for bet- ter healthcare in tribal areas: • Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) are established as part of the Ayushman Bharat programme. • National Free Drugs Service Initiative and Nation- al Free Diagnostic Service Initiative have been rolled out. • The ASHA programme provides for recruitment of ASHA at habitation level, in hilly, tribal and difficult areas. • National Ambulances Services under NHM for free transportation of sick patients to the health facilities. • All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) Way ahead: • Urgent need to empower tribal communities and ensure they receive equitable, affordable and ac- cessible healthcare. \t This can be ensured by suitable investments (in medical colleges and training centres across such remote areas), public policy and governance. • Empowering tribal communities must be done stra- tegically. \t With a more communitarian social setup, an underdeveloped economy dependent on forest resources and unique geographic conditions, their health outcomes necessi- www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 44 tate a unique approach. Best practices: • Mera Baccha Abhiyan: \t It aims to fight malnutrition through pub- lic participation in Datia district, Madhya Pradesh. \t As a result, the district witnessed a drop in malnutrition rates (by 17.5%), rise in immu- nisation, breastfeeding and a drop in diar- rhoea. • Piramal Swasthya - One of the largest implementing agencies of primary healthcare programmes in India: \t It has over a decade’s experience of work- ing with the tribal communities of Andhra Pradesh, implementing its unique commu- nity-based model. \t More recently, it has partnered with NITI Aayog to transform the health and nutrition systems in 25 Aspirational Districts spread across 7 States of India. Conclusion: • As India moves towards India@100, the responsibil- ity of providing healthcare (a fundamental human right) for all lies both with private and government institutions. • Tribal communities can be empowered by inclusive leadership and investments in healthcare infrastruc- ture, contributing to the UN SDGs.

ALL-IN-ONE INSURANCE POLICY PLAN Context: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) in India is working on an all-in-one policy plan to ad- dress the low insurance penetration in India. Aim: • To offer an affordable bundled insurance product that covers health, life, property, and accident risks. • To expedite claim settlements by linking death reg- istries onto a common platform • To create a “UPI-like moment” in insurance, similar to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the bank- ing sector Plan by IRDA (Bima Trinity of the policy): • Bima Sugam: The portal will integrate insurers and distributors, providing customers with a one-stop shop for purchasing insurance policies and managing service requests and claim settlements. It will also be integrated with digitized birth and death registries • Bima Vistar: It will be bundled risk cover product, which offers defined benefits for each risk and aims to provide faster claim payouts without the need for surveyors. • Bima Vaahaks: The third component of the plan in- volves deploying a women-centric workforce called Bima Vaahaks (carriers) in each Gram Sabha (village council) to promote the benefits of insurance prod- ucts. Other plans: • State-level insurance committees: To achieve the goal of providing insurance coverage for all citizens by 2047, the IRDA plans to establish State-level insurance com- mittees and involve State governments in formulating district-level insurance plans. • Amendment to insurance laws (Insurance Act, 1938) to allow differentiated capital requirements for niche in- surers, attract more investments, and enable the addi- tion of value-added services to insurance policies. Benefits: • It will provide citizens with an affordable single poli- cy that covers health, life, property and accident • Settling claims within a short timeframe (potentially within six to eight hours or a maximum of one day) • Will allow policyholders to easily access their policies and submit death certificates, enabling quick processing and transfer of funds. Issues with the current Insurance law: The current insur- ance laws in India do not allow the inclusion of value-add- ed services along with insurance policies. For instance, in- surance companies are restricted from offering additional benefits like an annual yoga membership or nursing ser- vices for policyholders’ parents who live far away. In 2022, India’s life insurance penetration stood at around 3%, while the non-life insurance penetration was much lower at one percent. About IRDA: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (founded 1999; HQ: Hyderabad) is a statutory body (under the IRDA Act 1999) and is under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Finance and is tasked with regulating and licensing the insurance and re-insurance industries in India.

COVID-19 IS NO MORE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF INTERNATIONAL CONCERN Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was no longer a public health emergency of inter- national concern (PHEIC). When was it declared PHEIC? COVID-19 was announced as a ‘PHEIC’ by the WHO on Jan- uary 30, 2020. What is the current status of COVID-19? It has acquired the status of other endemic diseases (from the pandemic). India reached the COVID-19 endemic stage a year ago. Trends during COVID-19 spread in India: • ‘COVID deniers’ at the beginning of the pandemic: Resulted in the spiking of COVID-19 cases in India. • Misinformation during the 2nd wave: A third wave in India would affect children resulting in the depri- vation of schooling and learning of children. • Policy interventions missed factoring in the local context: Local context determines the epidemiolog- ical pattern, spread of disease, and proposed inter- ventions. Steps taken by India towards Covid-19 prevention: • Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Consor- tium (INSACOG) for genomic sequencing and track- ing the evolution of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. • The National Biopharma Mission (NBM) and the Ind-CEPI Mission have enabled the strengthening of the national vaccine development ecosystem. • Mission COVID Suraksha was launched as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 for promoting the R&D of Indian COVID-19 vaccines. Some best practices in India: • “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign: Aims at awareness, mobilisation and vaccination of all eligible beneficia- ries. • Training of healthcare professionals: The Govern- ment of India has utilized the iGOT (Integrated Gov- ernment Online Training) platform to train various personnel. Lessons from COVID Pandemic that India must embrace and implement: • Invest in healthcare (HC) infrastructure. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 46 • India needs National HC Services Regulatory Au- thority: To check rampant black marketing of criti- cal drugs, artificial shortage and discrepancies in the cost of the same. • India needs more doctors, paramedics and hospi- tals. • Revamp Primary health centres with the PPP mod- el. • Bring the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under PMO to enhance proficiency in predicting future pandemics. • Better pay and training of ASHA workers: They played a critical role in creating awareness in rural India - allaying fake apprehensions regarding vac- cines. • Fight disinformation in mission mode. • A strategic reserve of critical medicines. Way ahead: • COVID-19 has ‘officially’ transitioned from a popula- tion-level challenge to more of an individual health concern. • The government should offer formal training cours- es in epidemiology to prepare India for future out- breaks and epidemics and to curb misinformation. • Integrate the COVID-19 response to general health services. • It is time to drop the COVID-19 fixation and move on to tackle other more pressing health challenges in the country.

UN REPORT: IMPROVING MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH AND SURVIVAL AND REDUCING STILLBIRTH Context: According to a report by the United Nations global progress on improving maternal and newborn health has halted since 2015. Objective of the report: It outlines progress at the mid-point for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and highlights priority actions towards eliminating preventable maternal and new- born deaths and stillbirths. Global Findings: • Global progress in reducing deaths of pregnant women, mothers and babies has stagnated for eight years • Deaths: Over 4.5 million women and babies die every year during pregnancy, childbirth or the first weeks after birth - mostly from preventable or treatable causes if proper care was available. \t 290 000 maternal deaths each year \t 1.9 million stillbirths (babies who die after 28 weeks of pregnancy ) \t 2.3 million newborn deaths (in the first month of life) India Findings: • India tops the list of 10 countries which bear 60% of global maternal deaths, stillbirths & newborn deaths burden • India accounts for 17 per cent of global maternal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal births Despite the high numbers, As per the Sample Registra- tion System (SRS) report by the Registrar General of India (RGI), the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India has re- duced from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to 113 per 100,000 live births in 2016-18. Reasons for the halt in progress: Reasons Examples Decr ea si n g investments in maternal and newborn health Just 1 in 10 countries (of more than 100 surveyed) report having sufficient funds to implement their health schemes relat- ed to maternal and newborns. Lack of Infra- structure Less than a third of countries report hav- ing sufficient newborn care and maternal care units. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 47 Pr ema t u ri - ty (the lead- ing cause of u n d er - fi v e deaths glob- ally) According to the report, every year, 2.5 million babies are born prematurely, and one million of these babies die due to complications. C O VID-19 pandemic Around a quarter of countries still report ongoing disruptions to vital pregnancy and postnatal care and services for sick children. Rising poverty Poverty can impact access to quality ma- ternal and child healthcare services, nu- trition, and education. W or sening humanitarian crises For example, the current crisis in Sudan and the Russia-Ukraine war can affect ac- cess to healthcare services and supplies. Gender in- equality Only about 60% of women aged 15-49 years make their own decisions regard- ing sexual and reproductive health and rights. This can affect access to healthcare services and information. Recommendations: • Scale-up access to quality sexual and reproductive health services as part of universal health coverage and primary health care • Use of technology: E.g., using a simple, low-cost collec- tion device called a ‘drape’ to reduce blood loss during delivery • Addressing harmful gender norms, biases and inequal- ities • Investment and political commitment • Strengthening service delivery for quality and respectful care • Community engagement • Data and information systems • Access to quality emergency obstetric care (EmOC) Targets to be achieved: Frame an action plan to end preventable newborn deaths Build strategies for ending preventable maternal mortality 90% of pregnant women receiving at least four antenatal care contacts Skilled health personnel attending 90% of births 80% of new mothers and babies receive postnatal care within two days of birth 80% of districts across countries have access to emergency obstetric services and small and sick newborn care .

(UPSC 2020) ISSUES RELATING TO POVERTY AND HUNGER 20. POVERTY ESTIMATION IN INDIA Context: There has been no official estimate of poverty in India after 2011-12. However, many private estimates are available. Poverty estimation in India: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 48 • Poverty can be defined as a condition in which an individual or household lacks the financial resources to afford a basic minimum standard of living. • Reliable estimation of poverty is the first step to- wards eradication of poverty as it provides input for the design, implementation and monitoring of an- ti-poverty programmes. • Two critical components of the estimation of pov- erty in India: \t Information on the consumption expendi- tures; \t These expenditures are evaluated with ref- erence to a given poverty line. • In 2011, 21.9% of Indians were considered to be liv- ing below the national poverty line. • Globally, 8% lived on less than the international pov- erty line (WB) of US$1.90 per person per day. Issues with estimates of poverty in India: • Vary in a wide range: From as high as 35% of India’s population in 2017-18 (by S. Subramanian) to a low of 1.4% (by Bhalla, Bhasin and Virmani) found for 2019-20. • No clear conclusion/consensus on whether poverty rose after 2011-12 or fell. Why do these differences arise? • Due to varying consumption expenditure data used. \t A modified version of data (by Bhalla) from the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CME) shows that poverty has declined in India. \t While the National Statistical Office (NSO) data (by S. Subramanian) that poverty in- creased in India. \t The only consumption expenditure survey conducted by NSO in 2017-18 was aban- doned. • Due to different poverty lines used: \t The consumption aggregates from the PLFS estimate poverty at 17.9% in 2020-21, com- pared with 21.9% in 2011-12. \t The latest (Panagariya and More) report a poverty ratio of 32% in 2019-20 and 26% in 2020-21 using the same PLFS consumption data. Good news for India: • A consumption expenditure survey is currently un- derway. • This will update the national accounts and inflation indices. Challenges: • The new methodology adopted: The absence of a comparable survey means it won’t help answer what happened to poverty after 2011-12. • No public discussion on the new methodology. Conclusion: The discourse on poverty estimation has played an import- ant role in highlighting the living conditions of the poor and the effectiveness of government policy. Thus, the adoption of a scientific methodology that will generate uniform-er- ror-free data is the need of the hour.

(UPSC 2015) 21.THE GOAL OF ZERO HUNGER Context: To achieve the goal of zero hunger, India should have a spe- cial and immediate focus on India’s youngest children. Why do India’s youngest children need urgent attention? • According to the WHO, a minimum of 33% of the dai- ly calorie intake is expected to come from food (at six months of age). The child obtains the remaining calories through “on-demand” breastfeeding. • According to the NFHS-5, 18% of mothers reported that their child (between ages 6-23 months) did not eat any food/“zero-food” in the 24 hours preceding the survey. • Close to 40% did not eat any grains (roti, rice, etc) for an entire day, and six out of 10 children do not consume milk (“zero-milk”). • This raises serious concerns related to severe food in- security. Steps taken: • Mission Poshan 2.0: The flagship programme dedicat- ed to maternal and child nutrition. • National Food Security Act 2013 • Zero Hunger Programme: Began in 2017 to improve agriculture, health and nutrition. • Eat Right India Campaign • Food Fortification • PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana Challenges: • Zero-food underscores that achieving sufficiency in food production (the world’s leading country in milk production) does not necessarily mean attaining food security. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 49 • Deficiency in data (food-based metrics) related to food and dietary consumption to effectively monitor and assess the performance of government initia- tives. • The rising burden of cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in India. • Disruptions in global food production and dis- tribution systems, accentuated by the ongoing Ukrainian-Russian conflict. What needs to be done? • Given their multifactorial nature with regard to what causes stunting or wasting among children, the specific nature of the deficiencies must be as- sessed. \t For this, assessments using household-level food insecurity modules developed by the FAO can be adapted. \t This will constitute the foundation for any evidence-based policy. • Multiple (not single) ministries/departments of the Government of India should take responsibility for designing, implementing and monitoring policies. The success story of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): SBM offers valuable insights for schemes like Poshan 2.0, in its strategic use of directly trackable metrics, and strong political commitment at the highest levels. Conclusion: To achieve the SDG 2 of zero hunger, India should consider a strategic initiative aimed at eliminating food insecurity by ensuring adequate-affordable-accessible-nutritionally di- verse food, with a special and immediate focus on mothers and children. Insta Links: The road to zero hunger by 2030 Mains Links: Q. There is a growing divergence in the relationship be- tween poverty and hunger in India.

HUNGER HOTSPOTS – FAO-WFP EARLY WARNINGS ON ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY Context: According to a new UN report - Hunger Hotspots – FAO-WFP early warnings on acute food insecurity - India’s neighbours (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar) are among the hun- ger hotspots in the world. Highlights of the report: • Many hotspots [Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Haiti, and the Sahel (Burkina Faso and Mali)] are facing growing hunger crises. • Conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks continue to drive more and more communities into crisis. • The spillover from the crisis in Sudan is driving mas- sive population displacement and hunger among people in search of refuge. Risks ahead: • Deepening economic shocks and a likely El Nino climatic phenomenon is raising fears of climate ex- tremes in vulnerable countries around the globe. • Acute food insecurity can potentially increase in magnitude and severity.

Case of India: • The Global Hunger Index 2022 ranks India 107 (out of 121 countries), and the level of hunger and un- dernutrition in the country is now at “serious” lev- els. • India’s rank on this index has been worsening since 2020 - 94 in 2020 and 101 in 2021. • With 19.3%, India has the highest rate of child wast- ing (among under 5 children) in the world. • About 16.3% of Indians are undernourished, and about one in every three children is stunted. Real problem: • India is the largest producer of milk, pulses, banan- as, and the 2nd-largest producer of wheat, rice, and vegetables in the world. • Therefore, poor hunger indices can be attributed mainly to food losses and wastage in India. • Crops lost between post-harvest and the retailer (due to poor storage, handling, and transportation) are referred to as losses. Food wastage is the loss of food at the consumer’s end. • Anywhere between 1% (in the case of milk) to 16% (guava) of the agricultural produce is lost by the time it reaches the retailer. Way ahead for India: • By providing farmers with a mechanism to access real-time prices, processing to absorb ‘excess’ pro- duction and scientific storages like silos and logisti- cal support. • Innovations and investments, both public and pri- vate, are key to addressing the food loss and waste challenges. For example, \t GreenPod Labs is innovating in the packag- ing and storing of produce to augment their shelf life. \t Dehaat provides an online marketplace to farmers and buyers that reduces the num- ber of hands the food trades in. 22. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BENEFITS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS Context: According to a UN report, India’s pilot studies on rice fortifi- cation showed a significant drop in the prevalence of anae- mia among schoolchildren. Food Fortification: • It is defined as the practice of adding vitamins and minerals to commonly consumed foods during pro- cessing to increase their nutritional value. • Food fortification has been identified as the strategy by the WHO and FAO for decreasing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies at the global level. The scenario in India: • In 2016, the FSSAI established standards for the for- tification of rice, wheat flour, edible oil, double-for- tified salt (DFS) and milk. It developed the ‘+F’ logo and helped build capacity for food producers. • The pilot public food fortification programme was launched in 2019 by the FSSAI in partnership with external non-profits, who are also associated with the nutraceutical industry. • Fortified foods are now being included in public food schemes like PDS, ICDS, and Mid-Day Meal Scheme/Poshan, helping to address the challenge of malnutrition. Impact: Fortification may contribute to the prevention, reduction and control of micronutrient deficiencies through mass for- tification or targeted fortification. Major issues with food fortification: • The one-sided portrayal of fortification as a ‘cure- all’: Without any significant scientific perspective and evidence on fortification. • No independent risk analysis: FSSAI’s statutory reg- ulations caution against consuming iron-fortified food by patients with thalassemia and sickle cell Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 51 anaemia. • Conflict of interest: The studies which FSSAI relies on to promote fortification are sponsored by private food companies. • Evaluation studies are still not publicly available. Case of treating iron deficiency anemia in India: • Iron is an essential mineral required for many bodily functions, including the formation of haemoglobin, but can be harmful when taken in excess (tolerable upper limit - 40 mg/day). • One of the methods suggested for the treatment of iron deficiency is the fortification of food with iron. • As men cannot ‘excrete’ iron from the body (unlike women), they are particularly vulnerable to excess iron intake. • Studies have shown that unabsorbed iron can lead to constipation, and diarrhoea and has been closely linked to many chronic comorbidities like diabetes, and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. • It can impair the absorption of other minerals such as zinc and copper, which are also essential for the body and lead to other deficiencies. Way ahead: • Fortification should be pushed in a transparent man- ner. • To treat undernutrition in India, all three - dietary diversity, higher protein consumption and fortifica- tion, are essential. • It is imperative to develop individualised strategies and ensure thorough monitoring to detect any ad- verse events at the earliest.

The Centre then gets a certain percentage of officers from each state on central deputation. • Other services are called Central Civil Services (such as the Indian Foreign Service, the Indian Revenue Ser- vice, Customs and Central Excise Service, etc). These are under the central government with no state cadre system. Rules governing civil services: • There are two sets of rules for civil servants - one for AISs (The AIS Conduct Rules, 1968) and the other for CCSs (The CCS Conduct Rules, 1964). • These were framed based on recommendations of the Committee on Prevention of Corruption head- ed by K Santhanam - constituted in 1962. Code of conduct highlighted in the rules: ● Every member of the Service shall - \t Maintain high ethical standards, integrity and honesty; political neutrality; account- ability and transparency; fairness and im- partiality; responsiveness to the public, etc. \t Use public resources efficiently, effectively and economically; declare any private inter- ests relating to his public duties to resolve any conflict of interest. \t At all times maintain devotion to duty, and do nothing which is unbecoming of a mem- ber of the Service. ● No member of the Service shall - \t Use his/her position to secure employment for any of his/her family members with any private undertaking/NGO; \t Give or take or abet the giving or taking of dowry. ● A member of the service may accept gifts from his near relatives or friends having no official dealings with them. \t But, he shall report to the government if the value of such gift exceeds Rs.25,000. ● While members can hold personal political beliefs, these rules restrict the degree to which they can act on them. For example, members not allowed - \t To be part of, assist political parties; inter- fere with or take part in an election to any legislature or local authority. \t To criticise any current policy or action of the government. However, civil servants are allowed to express their opinion on official documents. Penalties for transgressions: • Major penalties can include “dismissal” from the service as well. • Besides, there are also the penal provisions men- tioned under the Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA). Issues with the Conduct Rules: • Vague: For example, while the promotion of casteism is not covered under any specific Conduct Rules, casteist behaviour can be interpreted as “un- becoming of a member of the Service”. • Ambiguous: Ideas like personal integrity are not well defined. That is why evils like taking dowry are banned but seemingly common. • There is no ethical code for civil servants in India.

GENDER PARITY IN CIVIL SERVICES Context: In the Civil Services Exam of 2022, women secured the top 4 positions, and the percentage of women candidates recom- mended for services like IAS and IPS has risen from 24% to 34% since 2018, indicating an improvement in their partici- pation in the administration. Status of Women in Civil Services: • Despite progress over the years, women have com- prised only 13% of all Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers from 1951 to 2020. • The proportion of women entering the IAS increased from 9% in 1970 to 31% in 2020, but currently, only 21% of serving IAS officers are women. Challenges to equal participation of women in important positions include: Challenges Examples Cultural and Family Ex- pectations Families may hesitate over concerns about explaining years of preparation if women do not succeed or face difficulty finding a suitable groom. Distance and safety con- cerns deter women from leaving home to study in big cities. Limited At- tempts and Lower Re- cruitment Women tend to make fewer attempts at competitive exams compared to men. They are also less likely to take up powerful de- cision-making roles and more likely to seek voluntary retirement. Biases and Li mi t ed Postings Women face biases and limited opportuni- ties for promotions. They are often assigned roles overseeing cultural affairs, education, and welfare, while men dominate urban de- velopment, law and order, and finance. Double Bur- den of Fam- ily Respon- sibilities Women officers face expectations to bal- ance work with traditional roles as wives and mothers, leading to career compro- mises. The additional burden of domestic responsibilities hampers career growth. In t e r se c - tionality Gender disparities vary across marginalized communities and different states. Women from marginalized communities face wider gender gaps among aspirants. Lack of Rep- resentation at Higher Leadership Positions The first woman foreign secretary was ap- pointed in 2001 (Chokila Iyer) and the first woman finance secretary in 2011(Sushma Nath). India has never had a woman cabinet secretary. The share of women in top lead- ership positions in public administration is significantly lower compared to countries like Singapore, Australia, and Sweden. Gen d er Equality A 2021 UNDP global report on gender equality in public administration reports that women’s share of top leadership in In- dia is only 12% compared to 29% in Singa- pore, 40% in Australia and 53% in Sweden. Measures to increase women’s participation in Indian civil services: Measure Examples Aw ar e ne ss and Outreach Conducting career counselling sessions in schools and colleges to educate young girls about civil services; Organizing awareness campaigns through media platforms to highlight success stories of women civil servants. Gender Sensi- tization Implementing mandatory gender sensi- tization training for recruitment boards and existing civil servants; Establishing a code of conduct that promotes an inclu- sive and respectful work environment. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 54 Exam Reforms Reviewing the syllabus to ensure it is free from gender biases and reflects di- verse perspectives Coaching and Pr ep a r a t i o n Support Providing scholarships and financial as- sistance specifically for women candi- dates to avail coaching programs; Estab- lishing online platforms that offer study materials, mock tests, and mentorship to women preparing for civil services ex- ams. Family Sup- port and Social Norms Conducting awareness campaigns to challenge gender stereotypes and en- courage families to support their daugh- ters’ aspirations. Special Re- c r uitm e n t Drives Implementing targeted recruitment drives to increase women’s representa- tion in civil services Work-Life Bal- ance Introducing flexible working hours and telecommuting options to accommodate the needs of women civil servants. Estab- lishing onsite childcare facilities or pro- viding subsidies for childcare expenses. Sensitization of Existing Civil Servants Encouraging male civil servants to ac- tively support gender equality and act as allies for their female colleagues. Transpar en t Pr o mo ti o n s and Career Progression Ensuring merit-based promotions and career progression opportunities for women civil servants. M o n i t o ri n g and Reporting Publishing gender-disaggregated data on recruitment, representation, promo- tions, and retention to identify gaps and measure the effectiveness of interven- tions. Conclusion: Gender equality in public administration is crucial for an inclusive and accountable government that serves diverse public interests. To achieve gender parity in the bureaucracy, a shift in societal attitudes and family support is essential. Encouraging girls from an early age to consider the IAS as a serious career choice and providing adequate support and resources can help address the gender diversity problem. Mains Links Q.

INDIA AND BRICS Importance of BRICS for India: Importance Example Geo-Politics BRICS provides India with an opportunity to balance its strategic interests between the US and the Russia-China axis. Global Eco- nomic Order BRICS plays an important role in the G20, in shaping global economic policies and promoting financial stability. Voice of De- veloping Na- tions BRICS has emerged as the voice of devel- oping countries and is playing a significant role in protecting the rights of developing countries. Terrorism BRICS provides a platform for India to gal- vanize its efforts against terrorism and has worked within the grouping to take a strong stand against terrorism. Gl o b a l Grouping BRICS provides an opportunity for India to actively engage with China and resolve mutual disputes. It also helps in garnering support from other partner countries. Challenges for BRICS: Challenge Example Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 55 E c o n o mi c Divergence Brazil and Russia have been experiencing economic recessions in recent years, while China and India have sustained high growth rates. South Africa’s economy has been per- forming poorly, with high levels of unem- ployment and inequality. Political Dif- ferences Russia’s annexation of Crimea and involve- ment in conflicts in Ukraine and Syria have strained its relations with other BRICS mem- bers. China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea have been a source of tension with other BRICS countries that have com- peting claims in the region. Ins titu - tional Con- straints The New Development Bank (NDB), es- tablished by BRICS in 2014 to provide de- velopment financing, has faced challenges in disbursing loans and identifying viable projects. The Contingent Reserve Arrange- ment (CRA), a pool of foreign exchange re- serves, has not been tested yet. C oor dina - tion Diffi- culties Disagreements over the governance struc- ture of the NDB and the CRA, as well as differing priorities in areas such as trade, in- vestment, and climate change, have made it difficult for BRICS to present a unified front on many issues. Ext ernal Pressures The rise of protectionism, nationalism, and populism in some advanced economies has posed challenges for BRICS in terms of trade, investment, and access to capital. Way forward for BRICS: Example Reform of Multilateral Institutions BRICS countries could jointly advocate for the reform of the UN Security Council, calling for the inclusion of more develop- ing countries as permanent members. Resolve to Combat Ter- rorism BRICS countries could share best practic- es and intelligence to combat terrorism, as well as work together to cut off funding and resources for terrorist groups. P r om oting Technological and Digital Solutions for the SDGs BRICS countries could share their experi- ences in adopting and implementing dig- ital solutions in these sectors Expand - ing Peo- ple-to-People Cooperation BRICS countries could organize joint cul- tural events and exhibitions, establish more student exchange programs and scholarships, and encourage more tour- ism and business visits to each other’s countries. Conclusion: BRICS faces several challenges such as internal differences, global economic slowdown, and geopolitical tensions. How- ever, the group can remain relevant by expanding its agenda to promote comprehensive development and enhanced co- operation among all states. BRICS should also focus on the democratization of international issues, respect for cultural diversity, and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Mains Links Q. Discuss the importance of BRICS for India.

India-UAE Trade relations: United Arab Emirates (UAE) is India’s 3rd largest trading partner, after the United States and China, with a bilateral trade turnover of USD 68 billion in 2021. The UAE is also the 7th largest investor in India. Various dimensions of India-UAE CEPA: Dimension Example Trade in Goods The CEPA provides preferential market ac- cess for over 80% of products traded be- tween India and the UAE. Bilateral trade between India and the UAE reached historic highs during FY 2022-23, increasing from USD 73 billion to USD 84 billion, registering a 16% increase Trade in Services The CEPA covers 11 broad service sectors and more than 100 sub-sectors, such as business services, communication services, financial services, tourism, and transport services. Investment The CEPA provides for a liberal and non-dis- criminatory regime for cross-border invest- ment between India and the UAE. Te c hnic al Barriers to Trade (TBT) TBT aim to ensure that technical regula- tions, standards, and conformity assess- ment procedures do not create unneces- sary obstacles to trade. Sani t ar y and Phy- tosanitary (SPS) Mea- sures It aims to protect human, animal, and plant health by setting standards for food safety, animal and plant health, and other related issues. Dispute Set- tlement The CEPA includes provisions on dispute settlement, which provide for the resolu- tion of disputes between India and the UAE through consultations and negotiations. Movement of Natural Persons The CEPA includes provisions on the move- ment of natural persons, which aim to fa- cilitate the temporary entry of business- persons, investors, and skilled professionals between India and the UAE. Ph a rma - ceuti c al Products The CEPA includes provisions on pharma- ceutical products, which aim to promote cooperation in the regulation and marketing of pharmaceuticals between India and the UAE. Intellectu- al Property Rights (IPR) The CEPA includes provisions on IPR, which aim to protect and enforce intellectual prop- erty rights between India and the UAE. Di gi t al Trade The CEPA includes provisions on digital trade, which aim to promote the develop- ment of e-commerce and digital trade be- tween India and the UAE. Some of the challenges that the India-UAE CEPA may face are: • Competition from other existing trade agreements in the region • Diverse business and cultural practices between the two countries • The disparity in the level of development and economic size of the two countries • Possible resistance from domestic industries in both countries • Differences in regulatory standards and intellectual property protection. Conclusion: The trade between India and UAE has strengthened over the years, with the UAE becoming India’s closest geopoliti- cal partner in the Arab world. Despite recent challenges, the bilateral ties between the two nations have proven resilient. Insta Links: • India-UAE 28.

Giv- en the uncertain dynamics of Sino-Indian re- lations, China’s strategic presence in the Mal- dives remains a concern. Challenges in India-Maldives relations: • Political Instability: For instance, the arrest of Mal- dives’ opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed in 2015 and the subsequent political crisis strained India’s relationship with Maldives. • Radicalisation: The increasing number of Maldivians being drawn towards terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS) and Pakistan-based jihadist groups is a con- cern for India. • China’s Strategic Presence: China’s increasing stra- tegic presence in Maldives is a challenge for India. The Maldives has emerged as an important ‘pearl’ in China’s “String of Pearls” construct in South Asia, which is a concern for India’s security. • China’s dominance: In 2018, Maldives cancelled an agreement with India to develop a key naval base on the island of Marao.The move was seen as a result of China’s growing influence in the Maldives. • Political actions: Maldives cancelled a $511 mil- lion contract awarded to Indian company GMR to develop Male International Airport in 2012, which strained the relationship between the two countries. • Domestic Politics: The India Out campaign in Mal- dives, which seeks to create anti-India sentiments among the people of Maldives Conclusion: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 58 India needs to play a crucial role in ensuring regional se- curity in South Asia and surrounding maritime boundaries by actively participating in the Indo-Pacific security space.

BUDDHISM: INDIA’S SOFT POWER PRO- JECTION TOOL Context: India recently hosted a global Buddhist summit in New Del- hi, which saw the participation of key figures from the global Buddhist community, including the Dalai Lama. What is soft power diplomacy? • Soft power is the ability to obtain preferred outcomes by attraction rather than coercion or payment. Soft power diplomacy refers to the use of cultural, social, and economic means to influence the attitudes and behaviours of other countries, rather than relying solely on military or economic coercion. The concept of soft power was coined by Joseph Nye in the 1990s. • Examples include cultural exchanges, educational pro- grams, humanitarian aid, and public diplomacy cam- paigns. Importance of Buddhism for India’s soft power diplomacy: Examples Historical and Cultur- al Ties India’s cultural and historical ties with Bud- dhism can help strengthen its soft power diplomacy with Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Promoting R el i gi o u s Harmony As the birthplace of Buddhism, India can use its Buddhist heritage and teachings to en- gage with countries like China, which has a significant Buddhist population, to promote dialogue and understanding between the two nations. Ec onom ic Benefits India is currently home to seven of the eight most significant Buddhist sites in the world. The Indian government has been developing the Buddhist Circuit, a tourist trail that con- nects them. Pan-Asian presence 97 per cent of the world’s Buddhist pop- ulation lives in the Asian continent, and a number of countries such as Bhutan, Myan- mar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka conceive of Buddhism as intrinsic to their national values and identity Soft Power Projection India can use its Buddhist cultural diplomacy to improve its relations with Southeast Asian countries and increase its influence in the re- gion. 1. India has tried to provide an alterna- tive to contested global politics, with moral- ity as the guiding principle. 2. India’s Panchamrit principles in- clude “Sanskriti Evam Sabhyata” which means cultural and civilizational links Comparison of India’s approach to using Buddhism for soft diplomacy with that of China: India China Approach India has been pro- moting Buddhism as a soft power tool since the 1950s. China has been using Buddhism as a tool of soft power diplomacy for over two decades, particularly in South- east Asia and other parts of the world. Objec - tives To counter China’s growing influence, and promote India’s cultural heritage. To promote Chinese culture and expand China’s influence in the region and beyond. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 59 Key strat- egies India has focused on restoring an- cient Buddhist sites, building new ones, supporting scholars and monks, and promoting Bud- dhism through cul- tural exchanges. During the Cold War, China effectively used Buddhist diplomacy to engage with its neigh- bouring countries, and it continues to employ this approach to gain le- gitimacy for its Belt and Road Initiative. Also, China has invest- ed heavily in building Chinese Buddhist tem- ples and monasteries abroad. Film Link India has not been able to effectively utilize this domain China, with its influence over Hollywood, has completely dominated the narrative around Buddhism through cin- ema. Examples of initia- tives Restoration of the ancient Nalanda University, orga- nizing the Inter- national Buddhist Conclave, 1 st global Buddhist summit and promoting Bud- dhist circuit tourism in India. China has established the World Buddhist Fo- rum, which brings to- gether Buddhist leaders from around the world. Support the restoration of ancient Buddhist sites, such as the Ang- kor Wat temple com- plex in Cambodia. India faces several challenges in promoting soft power through Buddhism, including: • Many of India’s ancient Buddhist heritage sites are in a state of disrepair, which makes it challenging to attract visitors and promote Buddhist tourism. • Competition with other countries: Despite being home to a number of key Buddhist sites, such as Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar, India has struggled to attract Buddhist tourists, who tend to favour sites in Thailand and Cambodia. • Fragmented Buddhist community: The Indian Buddhist community is fragmented and divided along sectarian lines, which makes it challenging to create a unified ap- proach to promoting Buddhism. • India’s soft power is often overshadowed by its eco- nomic and political power, which means that its cultural influence, including that of Buddhism, is not always rec- ognized on the international stage. Conclusion: There is a need of promoting connections with other Bud- dhist schools of thought, such as Nagarjuna Buddhism, which is largely unexplored in academic study. Also, empha- size the need for effective implementation of the Nalanda University project and proper management of tourist sites for the success of the Buddhist Circuit Project. Quote: “India has not given ‘Yuddha’ to the world but ‘Buddha’.” –PM Modi Conclusion 2: As Buddha was the first diplomat of peace, his teachings of peace and cooperation in these tough times can become the guiding light of Indian diplomacy on the world stage.

STRATEGIC CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE US, UAE, SAUDI ARABIA Context: The meeting in Riyadh between Saudi Arabia and the US, UAE, and India underlines the growing strategic conver- gence between Delhi and Washington in the Gulf. What is unique about this meeting? • A major departure from the traditional approaches to the Middle East in both India and the US. • In India, the Nehruvian foreign policy either op- posed Washington or kept its distance from the US in the Middle East. Recent changes in India’s foreign policy Impact Shedding its “anti-West- ern” lens in the Middle East. Joining hands with the US (in the Middle East), openly showcased its friendly relations to Is- rael.

The formation of a four-nation grouping (in October 2021) called I2U2 brought the US, India, Israel, and the UAE to- gether. Delhi and London are ex- pected to work together in the Gulf soon. Britain enjoys much residual in- fluence in the Gulf. A new quadrilateral with the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 60 Recent changes in USA’s foreign policy (recalibrating its re- gional strategy): • Pakistan was a key part of the Baghdad Pact (1955), Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the Region- al Cooperation for Development (1964) to counter the Communist threat to the region. • However, it does not figure in the current strategy to connect the Gulf with the Subcontinent. • This means the US is discarding its pro-Pakistan bias in thinking about the relationship between the Sub- continent and the Gulf and building new partner- ships, including with Delhi. What led to the changes in the foreign policies of India and the US? • The decline in the Role of Pakistan in the Middle East: \t Pakistan’s continuing strategic decline, and socio-economic-political challenges. \t Pakistan has drifted too close to China (all-weather partnership), tempted to align with China and Russia in the region. • The rising power of the Arabian Peninsula: \t The Gulf kingdoms (especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have accumulated massive financial capital and economic transforma- tion will reduce their dependence on oil. \t They have also begun to diversify their stra- tegic partnerships, develop nationalism, promote religious tolerance and initiate so- cial reform. India’s new possibilities in the Arabian Peninsula: • Regional partnership with the US is seen in terms of geopolitical competition with China, elevating its own standing in the region. • Economic growth and productive involvement in promoting connectivity and security. • Overcoming violent religious extremism within the Subcontinent. Challenges: Beijing is now the second most important power in the world, and its diplomatic and political influence in the Gulf region will continue to rise. Conclusion: Seizing the new strategic opportunities in the Gulf would involve the long overdue modernization of Delhi’s strategic discourse on the Gulf.

QUAD COOPERATION IN BIOTECHNOL- OGY Context: In order to give the necessary fillip to enhance Quad coop- eration in biotechnology, India should be an ideal choice for the establishment of a Quad-led biomanufacturing hub. Background: • In 2021, the Quad set up a Critical and Emerging Tech- nology Working Group to facilitate cooperation related to developments in critical and emerging technologies, including biotechnology. • However, the Quad countries do not collaborate enough in biotechnology yet. Biomanufacturing: • Meaning: It uses living systems, particularly micro- organisms and cell cultures, to produce molecules and materials on a commercial scale. • Potential: \t It can transform the global industrial sys- tem, with up to 60% of physical inputs to the global economy. \t Countries like the US and China have de- signed specific policies to shape their Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 61 bio-economies. Case of India: • The National Biotechnology Development Strategy envisions the country as a “Global Biomanufacturing Hub” by 2025. • While the strategy sets a target of $100 billion for the hub, it is important to recognize that India’s am- bitions require external support. India’s strengths: • Existing infrastructure, pharmaceutical manufactur- ing expertise, and skilled manpower. • India is among the top performers in the field of bio- manufacturing in both the quality of research and research publications. • India also has significant potential in low-cost bio- manufacturing (33% lower than the U.S.), particular- ly in the production of enzymes, reagents, research materials, and equipment. Challenges: • India still requires significant capability and capaci- ty uplifts to become a world leader. • China has expressed its intention to capture this market, similar to how it dominated small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). • Such dependence on the biomanufacturing sector will be detrimental to both India and the Quad. How does Quad complement these strengths? • The U.S. has significant funding capability. • Japan, Australia and the U.S. possess advanced bio- technology innovation ecosystems and intellectual property. Advantages of the proposed hub for India and Quad: • Can help facilitate technology transfer, • Connect investors, • Establish a biomanufacturing fund that is adminis- tered through the Quad, • Support efforts to reduce dependency on China. Way ahead for India: • Strengthening physical infrastructure. • A scheme on the line the PLI scheme allocated $2 billion to the pharmaceutical sector to make bio- pharmaceuticals, APIs, etc. • Boosting the workforce by enabling access to cut- ting-edge technology and training, with a focus on commercialising R&D. Conclusion: • The proposed hub in India can capitalise on the eco- nomic potential of the biomanufacturing industry and address existing and potential vulnerabilities in the global system. • Through cross-Quad collaboration, India may emerge as a major force in the field of biomanufac- turing and assist the Quad in competing in this key area.

FORUM FOR INDIA PACIFIC ISLANDS COOPERATION (FIPIC) Context: Addressing the opening session of the FIPIC-3 summit (in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea/PNG), the PM of India highlighted the importance of the 14 members of the FIPIC. The Pacific Island Countries (PICs): • It consists of the 3 major groups of islands: Melane- sia, Micronesia and Polynesia, and commonly refers to the 14 countries scattered in the South-West Pa- cific Ocean. • These are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. • The region comprises strategically located (at the crossroads of significant maritime trade routes) small island nations, with small populations and resource-rich Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). • Their profile is rising particularly given the populari- ty of the Indo-Pacific construct. India’s engagement with the PICs: • In the early 19th century, Indian workers were taken to the region to work as indentured plan- www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 62 tation labourers and most of whom settled par- ticularly in Fiji and PNG. • After independence, the region did not find much significance in India’s foreign policy. • However, the changing geopolitical scenario and strategic and economic compulsions, rising na- val capabilities have driven India to refresh and redesign its Pacific policy. • India’s renewed interest can also be seen in the light of its own rechristened Act East policy. • At this moment, the total annual trade between India and PICs is about $300 million – exports are around $200 million and imports are around $100 million. The Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC): • It was launched during the PM of India’s visit to Fiji in 2014 and includes 14 of the PICs. • The FIPIC initiative marks a serious effort to expand (from the Indian Ocean) India’s strategic and com- mercial interests in the Pacific region. India’s major assistance projects in the PICs: • Setting up a special USD 1 million fund for adapting to climate change and clean energy, establishing a trade office in India, Pan Pacific Islands e-net- work to improve digital connectivity. • India has increased the annual “Grant-in-Aid” from USD 125,000 to 200,000 to each of the 14 PICs for community projects of their choice, and launched a new Visitors Programme for PICs. • At the FIPIC-2 (Jaipur, 2015), FICCI launched the Busi- ness Accelerator for FIPIC to provide necessary information and facilitation to businessmen on both sides. The advantage to India: Presence of a sizable Indian Dias- pora – nearly 40% of Fiji’s population is of Indian origin and about 3000 Indians live in PNG. Challenges: India’s interaction with the PICs still largely re- volves around its engagement with Fiji and PNG. Way ahead: • Climate change is a crucial area of common con- cern where closer partnerships can be devel- oped for effective and concrete solutions. • For India, it is important to develop a comprehen- sive and clearly defined strategy to engage with all the PICs. Conclusion: • The PM of India (at the FIPIC-3) called PICs “large ocean states”, highlighting their strategic-com- mercial importance for India. • The recent efforts have brought India much clos- er to PICs and to further strengthen its ties, In- dia should assist the development goals of the PICs. 33. G7: DE-RISKING AND EFFECTIVE CLI- MATE ACTION Context: The 49th annual summit (Hiroshima, Japan) of the G7 lead- ers concluded recently. Highlights of the summit: • G7 countries said that they would build economic resilience for themselves, based on a strategy of di- versifying and deepening partnerships and de-risk- ing, not decoupling. • G7 acknowledged the urgency for effective climate action but offered little in terms of scaled-up action. What does de-risking and decoupling mean? De-risking Decoupling To move business away from areas that are con- sidered risky in terms of the returns they could generate. It is used as an alternative to an economic boycott to re- duce correlation between markets. To have resilient, effective supply chains to prevent coer- cion of any other country. Why was ‘de-risking’ used by G7 countries? To describe their stance towards China on economic matters. De-risking in the context of China: It can be interpreted as a reduction of the reliance on China in the economic sphere - for the supply of materials or as a market for finished goods, so that potential risks to trade and disruption of supply chains are reduced. G7 on effective climate action Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 63 Need • The 1.5 degree Celsius threshold was likely to be temporarily breached over the next five years (WMO). • Surpassing 2016, 2023 is on track to be- come the warmest ever. • The probability of occurrence of heat waves in India and neighbouring countries has increased by 30 times due to global warming. Mile - s t o n es listed for effective cl i ma t e action • A global peak by 2025: The G7 claimed that their GHG emissions had already peak- ed, and asked all major economies (India, China, Brazil, South Africa, and Russia) to ensure that their individual emissions peak by 2025. • Net-zero by 2050: It is essential in order to meet the 1.5 degree Celsius target. The G7 asked all major economies to come up with detailed road maps to reach the target. • Eliminating “inefficient fossil fuel subsi- dies” by 2025. Chal - lenges in meeting the mile- stones • The 2025 peak year is not mandated un- der the Paris Agreement. India has indicat- ed that its emissions will grow in the next decade as well. China, the world’s largest emitter, would peak only towards the end of this decade. • Only Germany (among the major emitters like the US, EU) has said it would attain net-zero status by 2045. • China would turn net-zero in 2060, while India has set 2070 as the target.

EU’S CARBON BORDER TAX Context: The European Parliament - the legislative body of the 27-member EU, reached a political deal on the carbon border tax - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Background: • CBAM was first introduced as a part of the European Green Deal, which serves as a guide for both tax and non-tax policy initiatives in the EU to achieve its am- bitious target of becoming climate neutral by 2050. • This was followed by a proposal for a regulation on CBAM in 2021 as part of the “Fit for 55” policy pack- age, aiming to reduce GHG by at least 55% by 2030, from the levels of 1990. What is the CBAM? • It plans to impose a tariff/import duty on a set of carbon-intensive imports, which will have to be paid by EU importers and companies who export such goods to EU countries. Need for CBAM: • To prevent “carbon leakage”: \t Carbon leakage is when companies relo- cate the production or manufacturing of carbon-intensive materials to countries with less stringent climate rules. \t This is to avoid restrictions on carbon emis- sions in their home country. ● To nudge behavioural change: \t According to WB, less than 4% of glob- al emissions are currently under carbon pricing regimes as envisioned by the Paris Agreement. \t Most levies aren’t high enough to effect an actual change in polluter behaviour. Old vs proposed regime in the EU Emissions Trading System CBAM Industries have to buy car- bon certificates if the num- ber of emissions crosses the cap. Will Phase out free carbon allowances to domestic busi- ness, so that it doesn’t get in a tangle with the WTO’s rules. Significance: By setting the price for the carbon content of goods regard- less of where they are produced, it will create a level field for businesses inside the bloc and those outside. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 64 Why are developing countries/India opposing CBAM? • BRICS have opposed the measure, describing it as a unilateral, protectionist trade weapon that could lead to market distortion. \t For example, India has contended that the CBAM will translate into a 20-35% tariff on India’s exports, which now attract an MFN duty of less than 3%. • Economic shock for countries reliant on one/more of the targeted industries. \t For example, Mozambique’s GDP would drop by about 1.5% due to the tariffs on al- uminium exports alone. \t 27% of India’s exports ($8.2 billion) of steel, iron and aluminium products head to the EU. Way ahead: Funds from the sale of the CBAM levy can be diverted to support climate action efforts in less developed countries. This will guarantee both climate justice and the achievement of carbon emission targets.

INDIAN DIASPORA: SRI LANKA’S MALAIYAHA TAMILS Context: The Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka has released a declaration calling for greater recognition, political rights, and improved living and working conditions. Who are the Malaiyaha Tamil community? The Malaiyaha Tamil community refers to a historically mar- ginalized group in Sri Lanka who migrated from southern In- dia around 200 years ago to work in British-run plantations. They mainly work in tea and rubber estates, contributing significantly to Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange earnings. Their population is roughly around 10 lakhs (out of which around 1.5 lakh people work in tea and rubber estates) Problems faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka: Problems Specific Examples Structur- al Exclu- sion Limited access to resources and opportunities compared to other communities. Poor human development indices compared to other com- munities. Discrim- i n a t i o n and Ex- ploitation Deprived of citizenship rights until 2003. Sub- jected to discrimination and exploitation in various aspects of life. I n a d e - quate Liv- ing Con- ditions Many families still reside in colonial-era line rooms without basic amenities. A UN body highlighted in 2021 that the community is liv- ing in “inhumane and degrading” conditions Economic Distress The financial crisis in Sri Lanka further exacer- bated their economic hardships. More than half the population living in estate areas is pushed into acute poverty. Low wag- es Their daily wage of LKR 1,000 (about ₹373) is tied to the target of 18-22 kg of plucked tea leaves every day, while braving leeches and wasp attacks. Lim it e d Political R ep r e - sentation Lack of recognition as a distinct identity and equal citizens. Demand for appropriate polit- ical power sharing and proportional electoral arrangements. To alleviate these problems, the Malaiyaha Tamil commu- nity has released a declaration demanding the following: • Design, resource, and implement a 10-year develop- ment plan based on affirmative action to address de- cades of structural exclusion. • Reduce poverty, provide land and housing, and en- hance public health and education access. • Ensure labour rights, including fair living wages and legal protection. • Recognize the Malaiyaha Tamils as a community with a distinct identity and equal citizenship. • Establish appropriate political power sharing and a pro- portional system of electoral arrangements. Assistance provided by India: • Grant projects cut across sectors such as education, health, livelihood, housing, and industrial develop- ment. • The Indian Housing Project aims to build 50,000 houses in war-affected areas and estate workers in the planta- tion areas. However, the progress on it has been slow. • India now offers about 710 scholarship slots annually to Sri Lankan students. • The reconstruction work of a century-old railway track in northern Sri Lanka under India›s assistance Conclusion: India and the International community must pressure Sri Lanka into providing the community with greater recogni- tion, political rights, and improved living and working con- ditions through affirmative action and long-term develop- ment plans.

WTO: OUTLAWING INDIA’S TECH TAR- IFFS Context: 3 WTO dispute settlement panels have found India’s tariffs (between 7.5 - 20%) on certain ICT products such as mobile phones inconsistent with India’s WTO obligations. Background: • One of the central objectives of the WTO is to boost transparency and predictability in the multilateral trad- ing order. • Hence, WTO member countries are under a legal obli- gation not to impose tariff rates in excess of the max- imum tariff rates committed in their Goods Schedule. What are the allegations against India? In the complaints brought by the EU, Japan and Taiwan, the WTO panels concluded that India has violated Article II of the GATT because India’s tariffs breach its Goods Schedule. India’s argument: The ITA (which it signed in 1997) contains India’s legally bind- ing tariff commitments on ICT products, hence, they are not legally binding. The WTO panels rejecting India’s argument: • India’s Goods Schedule (not the ITA) is the source of India’s legal obligations on tariffs. • The panels also rejected - \t India’s contention that its commitments un- der the ITA are ‘static’ - not including prod- ucts emerged due to technological innova- tions after the conclusion of the ITA. \t India’s argument is based on the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties - an error in a treaty would invalidate a state’s consent. • Accordingly, the panels have recommended India reduce its tariff rates and make them compatible with its Goods Schedule. Implications for India: • Compliance would mean dismantling the high pro- tective tariff wall that India has erected to boost do- mestic manufacturing of ICT products. • In case of non-compliance, the EU can unilaterally impose trade sanctions against the losing country. • Even if the EU does not impose trade sanctions, it might use this ruling as a bargaining tool in the on- going FTA negotiations with India. Options available to India: • The WTO’s Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides an opportunity to appeal against the panel ruling. \t However, the Appellate Body has ceased to exist since 2019 because the US has been blocking the appointment of the body’s members. • The EU has created an alternative appellate mecha- nism (under WTO) - the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA). However, India is not a party to this. • Legally, India will not be required to comply with the panel rulings till its appeal is heard. • Also, the EU can’t impose trade sanctions on India, because the WTO law does not allow trade sanc- tions when an appeal is pending. The Goods Schedules/Harmonized System of Nomencla- ture (HSN): • These are based on the World Customs Organisa- tion’s classification system, which catalogues traded products with specific names and numbers. • Due to the continuous emergence of new products owing to technological innovations, the HSN system is regularly updated to reflect new products, also known as ‘transposition’. WTO’s IT Agreement (ITA): • Adopted in 1996, it is an arrangement through which select WTO member countries agree to eliminate duties on IT products. • However, the commitments under the ITA become binding on a country under Articles II of GATT only if they are incorporated in the Goods Schedule.

WHO and WHA: • WHO: Since 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) - the UN specialized health agency, leads and championed global efforts to give everyone, every- where a safe and healthy life. • WHA: It is the main decision-making body of WHO and comprises 194 Member States. Every year, dele- gates from all Member States come together (gener- ally in May) to agree on the Organisation’s priorities and policies. Highlights of the 76th WHA: 1. Health for All: Transforming economies to deliver what matters report: • It was launched by the WHO Council on the Econom- ics of Health for All - formed in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. • The report provides a roadmap to focus on the links between health and sustainable, inclusive and in- novation-led economic growth. It recommended reorienting economies to deliver health for all across four interrelated themes: Significance: Instead of health for all being seen as the servant of eco- nomic growth → roadmap will structure economic activity in a way that will allow all people faster with better access to essential health services. 2. Pandemic treaty: • Negotiations on new rules for dealing with pan- demics are underway at the WHA. • The WHO already has binding rules known as the International Health Regulations - adopted in 2005 after the SARS outbreak. • These regulations are still considered appropriate for regional epidemics, such as Ebola but inade- quate for a global pandemic. What is the so-called Pandemic treaty? • It should be a legally binding treaty (proposed by the EU and to be adopted by May 2024) for those who sign up. • It would be only the second such health accord af- ter the 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - a treaty that aims to reduce smoking via taxation and rules on labelling and advertising. • Developing countries, especially in Africa, are keen to use the negotiations to secure better access to vaccines. • However, the proposed treaty has come under fire as critics warn that it could lead to countries ceding authority to the WHO.

(UPSC 2020) GS PAPER 3 INDIAN ECONOMY AND ISSUES RE- LATING TO PLANNING, MOBILIZA- TION, OF RESOURCES, GROWTH, DE- VELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT. 1. GST HAS BEGUN TO SHOW SUSTAINED GROWTH Context: The article highlights the trend in tax collection in India post-Covid, specifically focusing on direct taxes and GST. Direct Tax Vs GST Direct Tax GST Direct tax refers to the taxes imposed on in- dividuals and entities (levied directly on the taxpayer) based on their income, profits, or assets. It includes taxes like income tax, corpo- rate tax, and wealth tax. GST (Goods and Services Tax) is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. GST is a consumption-based tax that is charged at each stage of the supply chain, from produc- tion to the final sale. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 67 During COVID, direct tax experienced a de- cline of nearly 10% but then saw a growth rate of 49% in 2021-22 and 18% in 2022-23. The recovery in GST collection has been better compared to direct taxes. While the growth of corporation tax has been high, personal in- come-tax collection has declined. Better recovery in GST has been due to: a) e-invoicing and procedural simplification, b) better compli- ance procedures, c) the rising inflation rate and d) the rise in import duties About GST: GST (introduced on July 1, 2017) is a multi-stage collection mechanism and aims to be a unified indirect tax across the country on products and services. The objectives of GST in- clude simplifying the tax system, preventing misclassifica- tions and litigations, avoiding an inverted duty structure, and ensuring a destination-based consumption taxation ap- proach. Implementation: GST is implemented through a dual GST model, with the Cen- tre and States levying taxes on a common base. The rates for GST range from 5%, 12%, 16% and 28%, and it applies to most goods and services, excluding alcoholic liquor for hu- man consumption and five petroleum products (petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high-speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel). The GST Council, headed by the Union Finance Minister, is the governing body responsible for making key decisions regarding GST. Achievements of GST: Achievement Explanation High GST reve- nues GST revenues have shown a high growth rate ( constantly reaching over 1.5 Lakh crore a month collection) Te c hnologic al achievements The GSTN, the technology platform for GST, has been successfully stabi- lized, ensuring smooth operations and transactions. E-invoicing imple- mentation Mandating e-invoicing for businesses above Rs 100 crore has improved in- voice matching and detection of fake invoices, enhancing tax compliance. Improved tax compliance and enforcement E-invoicing, e-waybill and online pro- cesses have improved tax compliance and enabled better enforcement, reducing instances of fraud and dis- putes. Reduction in transaction costs GST has significantly reduced trans- action costs, making business opera- tions more efficient and cost-effective. Removal of hid- den and embed- ded taxes By removing hidden and embedded taxes, GST has improved the competi- tiveness of domestic industries in the global market. Seamless tax credits The system of seamless tax credits throughout the value chain and across state boundaries has minimized the cascading effect of taxes. Challenges/Limitations of GST: Challenge Explanation Refund de- lay issues There are concerns regarding delays in ex- port refunds, impacting businesses reliant on timely refunds under the GST regime. Rate dif- fe r e n tia - tion The presence of multiple tax rates is seen as inefficient for targeting benefits to the poor, leading to complexities and potential dispari- ties in the tax system. Lack of d i s p u t e redressal mech a - nism The absence of a statutory mechanism for uniform rulings by authorities has resulted in a lack of clarity and consistency in resolving disputes under the GST regime. Co n s t an t amend - ments The frequent amendments made to the GST law have caused confusion among taxpayers and tax administrators, leading to misunder- standings and misconceptions. Adaption and tech- nical is- sues Small and medium businesses face challeng- es in adapting to the tech-enabled GST re- gime, with IT glitches affecting the seamless flow of input credits and ease of compliance. C om ple x penalties Businesses often face difficulties in moni- toring vendor behaviour and believe they should not be penalized for compliance de- ficiencies of their vendors after paying GST amounts. 15th Fi- n a n ce Co mmi s - sion con- cerns The 15th Finance Commission has highlighted additional concerns, including the multiplici- ty of tax rates, shortfalls in GST collections, volatility in collections, and inconsistencies in return filing. The dependency of states on compensation from the centre is also a con- cern. Conclusion: Anti-profiteering measures and compliance procedures in GST need to be streamlined to ensure cost efficiency and price reduction benefits reach the common man.

Background: The strikes began when Blinkit slashed the min- imum payout per delivery to Rs 15 per delivery from Rs 25. The gig economy in India: • According to the NITI Aayog estimates, nearly 23.5 million workers will be engaged in the gig economy by 2029. Gig worker Gig workers refer to workers outside of the traditional em- ployer-employee relationship. There are two groups of gig workers - platform workers and non-platform workers. Platform workers Non-platform workers When gig workers use on- line algorithmic matching platforms or apps to con- nect with customers, they are called platform work- ers. Those who work outside of these platforms are non-plat- form workers, including construction workers and non-technology-based tem- porary workers. Issues faced by gig workers: • Since the gig economy falls outside the scope of tra- ditional, full-time employment, gig workers usually lack basic employment rights such as \t Minimum wages, \t Overtime pay, \t Medical leave, and \t A statutorily bound resolution of employ- er-employee disputes. • Whether gig workers should be categorised as ‘em- ployees’ or as ‘independent contractors’? • It depends on the extent of control and supervision exercised by the employer and the integration of the worker with the organisation. \t In India, employees are entitled to a host of benefits under the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bo- nus Act 1965. \t Similarly, contract labourers are governed under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 and are entitled to ben- efits under the EPF. \t However, gig workers display characteristics of both employees and independent con- tractors → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 69 What is the proposed law for gig workers? In keeping with the National Commission on Labour’s recom- mendation to consolidate central labour laws, the Ministry of Labour and Employment introduced the Code on Social Security 2020. Salient provisions in the Code on Social Security 2020: • It brings gig workers within the ambit of labour laws for the first time. • It distinguishes between such workers and employ- ees. • It stipulates that Central and State Governments must frame suitable social security schemes for gig workers. • A social security fund for gig workers, to which Gig employers must contribute 1-2% of their annu- al turnover → to be used for the aforementioned schemes. • It also mandates the compulsory registration of all gig workers to avail of benefits under these schemes. • It also envisages the constitution of a National So- cial Security Board by the Central government to monitor the implementation of such schemes. Concerns: • Out of the four new labour codes proposed, gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security. • Hence, they cannot create legally recognised unions and access a national minimum wage that applies to all forms of employment. • Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘un- organised workers’ or ‘wage workers’. • Gig workers also remain excluded from accessing the specialised redressal mechanism against their employers. • They also do not have the right to collective bargain- ing - a fundamental principle of modern labour law. • All the above leads to the violation of their funda- mental rights under Articles 14 and 21 and comes within the meaning of forced labour under Article 23. Can judicial intervention be expected? A petition demanding that gig workers or platform workers be declared as ‘unorganised workers’ so that they come un- der the purview of the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, is pending in the SC of India. Best practices: • In 2021, the UK Supreme Court classified Uber driv- ers as ‘workers’ under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996. • Germany’s Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers. • Singapore has also proposed legislative changes to ex- tend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers. Way ahead for India: • The Labour Codes need to be implemented as soon as possible. • For this, State governments should frame rules as soon as possible. Mains Links: Q.

WHY HAS THE RBI WITHDRAWN RS 2,000 NOTES? Context: The RBI has decided to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation. When were the Rs 2000 banknotes introduced? • On November 8 2016, the PM of India announced de- monetisation, withdrawing two banknotes (Rs 500 and Rs 1000) from circulation with immediate effect. • The Rs 2000 and the new Rs 500 note were introduced under (Section 26) of the RBI Act 1934, primarily with the objective of meeting the currency requirement of the economy expeditiously. Demonetisation Meaning It is the process of eliminating the lawful ac- ceptance status of a monetary unit → The existing types of currency are withdrawn through circulation and supplanted with new currency. Need While demonetization is exceptional, gov- ernments around the globe have used it to check - hyperinflation situations, counterfeit currency, terror and tax fraud, and to intro- duce a new monetary system in some circum- stances.

Effect on India The SC’s (4:1) ver- dict on demoneti- sation Why has the RBI withdrawn Rs. 2000 notes? • With the fulfilment of the objective, the printing of Rs 2000 notes was stopped in 2018-19. • The RBI issued the majority of the Rs 2000 denom- ination notes prior to March 2017 - now at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years. • Therefore, in pursuance of the Clean Note Policy of the RBI, it has been decided to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation. What is the Clean Note Policy? • The policy was introduced in 1999 by the then RBI Governor: Bimal Jalan. • It seeks to give the public good-quality currency notes and coins with better security features, while soiled notes are withdrawn out of circulation. • Under the policy, the RBI had earlier decided to with- draw from circulation all banknotes issued prior to 2005 as they have fewer security features. Will the Rs. 2000 banknotes continue to be legal tender? • Yes. The public can continue to use Rs 2000 banknotes for their transactions and also receive them in payment. • However, they are encouraged to deposit/exchange these banknotes on or before September 30, 2023. The RBI has not clarified the status of these notes after September 30. Could there be a repeat of the demonetisation chaos of 2016? • It is unlikely, as the printing of Rs 2000 notes was stopped in 2018-19, and they are no longer com- monly seen with the public (constitute only 10.8% of notes in circulation). • Also, the decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes was announced suddenly, taking the public by surprise.

RBI’S GOLD RESERVES Context: The RBI’s gold reserves touched 794.64 metric tonnes in fis- cal 2023, an increase of nearly 5% over fiscal 2022. Gold reserves • Meaning: It is the gold held by a national central bank. • Purpose: \t A guarantee to redeem promises to pay de- positors, note holders/paper money/trading peers, during the era of the gold standard - a monetary system (until 1971) in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. \t Currently, a store of value/ to support the value of the national currency. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 72 Why is gold used as a reserve in Central banks? Unlike fiat currencies, which can be subject to inflation or devaluation due to various economic factors, the value of gold tends to be relatively stable over time, which makes it an attractive asset for central banks to hold as a reserve. Additionally, gold is highly liquid, which means it can easily be converted into cash or used to settle international trans- actions. Composition of India’s gold reserves: • The 794.64 tonnes of gold reserves included gold deposits of 56.32 tonnes. • 437.22 tonnes of gold is held overseas in safe custo- dy with the Bank of England and the Bank of Interna- tional Settlements (BIS). • 301.10 tonnes of gold is held domestically. Comparison with total foreign exchange reserves: • As on March 31 2023, India’s total foreign exchange (forex) reserves stood at $578.449 billion, and gold reserves were pegged at $45.2 billion. • Thus, the share of gold in the total forex increased from about 7% (March 2022) to about 7.81%. Why are these reserves increasing? • RBI has been adding gold to its reserves to diversify its overall reserves. \t This change in strategy has been driven by negative interest rates in the past, the weakening of the dollar, global uncertainty and rising inflation. • As gold is considered a more safe, secure and liquid asset, it can safeguard RBI’s returns. What are other central banks doing? • Many other central banks, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), etc., have been buying gold. • The two key drivers behind the decision to hold gold - its performance during crisis times and its role as a long-term store of value.

CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY Context: The Indian government has decided to halt its plan to adopt a cross-border insolvency regime that would have allowed foreign lenders to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against defaulting Indian businesses in local tribunals. About Cross-border Insolvency: Cross-border insolvency typically occurs when a debtor has operations or creditors in multiple countries, and there is a need for coordination and cooperation among different courts and stakeholders to achieve an efficient and fair res- olution. • United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insol- vency, 1997, is a widely accepted legal framework to deal with cross-border insolvency issues. Why has India halted its plan? India halted the adoption of cross-border insolvency, based on the fact that only around 50 countries have adopted the UN model of cross-border insolvency, and many of them have stringent restrictions in place. Instead, the government’s current priorities include • Expanding the informal debt resolution scheme for larger corporations • Implementing a new regime for handling the insolvency of group companies • Creating a special regime for the real estate sector. • Remove lacunas in the operation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code • Reduce delays in case admission and approval of rescue plans • Prevent inappropriate transactions by the management of defaulting companies. About Insolvency: Topic Description Key Words • Insolvency: Inability to repay out- standing debt • Bankruptcy: Court declaration of in- solvency, with appropriate orders to resolve it and protect creditors’ rights. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 73 I n so l v en cy and Bank- ruptcy Code Enacted in 2016, it consolidates laws re- lated to the insolvency resolution of busi- ness firms. I n so l v en cy and Bank- ruptcy Code (Amendment Bill), 2021 Introduces Pre-packaged Insolvency Res- olution Process (PIRP) for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with defaults up to Rs 1 crore. Challenges for the IBC Lack of proper resolution with over 50% of cases ending in liquidation; Significant delays in resolution; High haircuts (debt foregone) by creditors; Lack of digitization Achievements A successful revival of India’s insolvency regime and addressing non-performing assets (NPAs); Improved credit discipline; India’s rank in resolving insolvency im- proved significantly Provision of Cross border Insolvency Currently, section 234 (empowers the central government to enter into bilat- eral agreements) and 235 (adjudicating authorities issuing letters of request to foreign courts) of IBC, 2016 provide a ba- sic framework for cross-border insolvency Conclusion: The introduction of a cross-border insolvency regime will be considered once the institutional capacity and overall bank- ruptcy resolution ecosystem are more robust.

SAI20: BLUEPRINT FOR A BLUE ECONO- MY Context: The Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) will chair SAI20 - the Engagement Group for Supreme Audit Institu- tions (SAls) of G20 countries in Goa. What is SAI20? • The SAI20 Engagement Group of G20 was estab- lished in 2022 during Indonesia’s Presidency of the G20. • The constitution of SAI20 stems from a recognition of the role of SAIs in - \t Promoting the efficiency, accountability, and transparency of public administration, and supporting SDG implementation. \t Promoting intergenerational equity and ad- dressing climate change concerns. Meaning of blue economy and its significance: • The global annual value of the blue/ocean economy is ~$2.5 trillion. • About 90% of global trade by volume [75% by val- ue] is carried out through sea routes. Efforts to promote blue economy: Global India Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles (2018): Laid out by the UNEP, the framework can be used by Investors to fund ocean-based industries and Finan- ciers to see how ma- rine investment can impact livelihood and poverty eradication. The blue economy is one of the 10 core sectors for national growth in India. COP15 (CBD): It laid out the global biodi- versity framework to conserve and sustain- ably use the planet’s biodiversity. A National Blue Economy Poli- cy that aims to harness maritime resources while preserving the country’s rich marine biodiversity has been prepared by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Compendium of Asset Accounts of Natural Resources: This first-ev- er country-wide handbook (by CAG) sets a national accounting framework for the blue economy. Conservation of Coastal Ecosys- tem report by CAG: The audit resulted in focused recommenda- tions to help improve the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) ecosystem. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 74 Challenges: • The measurement of the blue economy is challeng- ing due to conflicting definitions and issues while classifying different sectors and sub-sectors. • Climate change: Sea-level rise, water temperature, storm surges, cyclones and wave conditions are some of the signs. • Land use changes, sand mining and deforestation impinge on the coastal ecosystem. In the context of India, • ~15% of India’s coastal areas have witnessed chang- es between 1992 and 2018 due to agriculture, de- pleting forest cover and urbanisation. • The population living in the country’s coastal areas is expected to rise from 64 million in 2000 to 216 million by 2060. Two priorities for SAI20 deliberations: Blue economy and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). What is expected in the blue economy deliberations? ● Preparation of technology-driven tools to assess authorised development in coastal stretches and track marine water quality. ● Evolution of globally relevant audit toolkits for coastal spaces, which include - ○ Legal and institutional frameworks, ○ Compliance with coastal regulations, ○ Biodiversity conservation, ○ Capacity building and compliance to SDGs. Way ahead: • Disaster-resilient infrastructure along coasts • ICT hubs for early warning systems • The SAI20 audit toolkits being prepared under the leadership of the CAG of India will provide a unique opportunity for constructive dialogue to improve the auditing of ocean-based activities. Conclusion: The audit toolkits will help in the assessment of policy goals, and resource efficiency while leveraging economic opportu- nities towards a truly sustainable blue economy-based glob- al development model.

DECARBONISING TRANSPORT SECTOR Context: According to the ITF Transport Outlook 2023, acting now and decarbonising transportation can help in achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The ITF Transport Outlook 2023: It was released by the In- ternational Transport Forum (ITF) at the Leipzig Transport Summit. ITF: It is a think tank (administratively integrated with the OECD yet politically autonomous) for transport policy that organises the Annual Summit of transport ministers. Leipzig (Germany) Transport Summit: • Transport ministers from across 64 member coun- tries of the ITF gathered under the event theme of ‘Transport Enabling Sustainable Economies’. • The United Kingdom holds the current Presidency of the annual Summit. Highlights of the ITF Transport Outlook 2023 • If action to decarbonise transport is accelerated, the transport sector can still reduce its CO2 emissions by about 80% over the next 25 years (compared to 2019). • This drop will enable limiting the global tempera- ture increase to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - the Paris Agreement goal. Reaching this high-ambition scenario requires: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 76 • A combination of complementary policies that avoid unnecessary transport activity. • Shift to no-carbon transport and improve the effi- ciency of transport. • Scale up cost-competitive technologies and fuels to move people and goods with fewer emissions. Advantage of reaching this high-ambition scenario: The to- tal capital investment needs of core infrastructure (road, rail, airports and ports) will be 5% lower with ambitious policies in place than carrying on with business as usual. Policy recommendations: Initiatives: • The Decarbonising Transport initiative of the ITF: Promotes carbon-neutral mobility to help stop cli- mate change. • India: \t Forum for Decarbonizing Transport: Launched by NITI Aayog and WRI India, the project aims at bringing down the peak level of GHG emissions (transport sector) in Asia. \t EVs: National Electric Mobility Mission Plan, FAME Scheme, Incentives under PLI Scheme, etc. \t Alternative fuels (CNG, etc), Ethanol blend- ing, hybrid vehicles, BS (VI) norms, etc. ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION, TRADE AGREEMENT 10. TEPA BETWEEN INDIA AND EFTA STATES Context: The Secretary General of the European Free Trade Associ- ation (EFTA) states that a Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) between India and EFTA will enhance the economic partnership What is TEPA? A trade and Economic Partnership Agreement is a type of economic partnership agreement between countries. TEPA agreements offer flexibility in terms of negotiating terms and conditions, as the parties involved can tailor the agree- ment to their specific needs and interests. About EFTA: Topic Description European Free Trade Association (est. 1960; HQ: Gene- va) is an intergovernmental organization founded by four European countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland as an alternative to the EU. Purpose To promote free trade and economic cooperation among its member states and with other countries R e la tionship with EU EFTA has a close relationship with the EU and has signed several agreements, which allow for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people be- tween the EFTA countries and the EU Strength of EFTA countries The economy of these countries is very strong. They rank among the highest in the world in innovation, competi- tiveness, wealth creation per inhabi- tant, life expectancy, and quality of life. EFTA companies are also world leaders in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, machinery manufacturing, R&D-driven technology products, geothermal-re- lated technologies and many more. Potential Benefits of TEPA between India and EFTA States: Area Benefits Trade India’s growth and leadership in green technol- ogies can benefit from EFTA’s support. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 77 Ma rk e t Access Improved market access for Indian goods to EFTA markets where EFTA’s export products frequently serve as inputs in Indian export in- dustries. I n v es t - ment Increase in investment from EFTA states (They have already invested over USD 35 billion in In- dia) Mu t u a l Benefits EFTA states can benefit from India’s highly skilled workforce in the services sector, and In- dia can benefit from the over 400 companies established by EFTA states generating more than 1,50,000 jobs. Ren e w- able Technol- ogies EFTA states can contribute to India’s green growth aspirations with their cutting-edge technologies in solar, wind, hydro, and geother- mal power. Challenges in Implementing TEPA between India and EFTA Countries: Challenge Description E c onom ic structure While EFTA countries (developed econ- omies) focus on high-tech industries and services, India (developing economy) gen- erally serves lower and middle-tech indus- tries and services. Market access E.g., issues regarding tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers to ensure free and fair trade between the parties. Regulatory Differences in regulations, standards, and legal frameworks Securing do- mestic manu- facturers Particularly in sectors such as pharma- ceuticals, biotechnology, and machinery manufacturing, where EFTA countries have a competitive edge. Environmen- tal and social Addressing environmental and social chal- lenges, such as promoting sustainable de- velopment and gender equality, is crucial in establishing a long-term, successful partnership between the parties. Negotiation Negotiating a mutually beneficial agree- ment that meets the interests of all par- ties involved can be challenging. Conclusion: To ensure the conclusion of a mutually beneficial TEPA be- tween India and EFTA, outstanding issues should be ad- dressed, areas of mutual benefit identified, and collabora- tion on skilled labour promoted. Strong political involvement and guidance are necessary for a swift negotiation process. Mains Links: Q. What is a free trade agreement (FTA)? How are FTAs important for India?

FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN RURAL INDIA Context: According to a new study, access to financial services such as bank accounts can help Indian rural households cope better with challenges such as poverty, inequality, and cli- mate risks. What is FI? The process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an affordable cost. (RBI) Need for financial inclusion in rural India: • A key driver of economic growth, poverty alleviation and prosperity. • Access to formal finance can boost job creation, re- duce vulnerability to economic and climate shocks and increase investments in human capital. • At a macro level, it can support sustainable and in- clusive socio-economic growth for all. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 78 Highlights of the study: • 59% of the surveyed households experienced cli- mate shocks in at least one of the five previous years → using their own savings to cope with the issue. • As rural households have limited access to liquidity, they take high-interest loans from informal sources. • Households rely on financial assistance from kin and relatives followed by friends, village communi- ties, money lenders, and banks (in this order). Factors affecting access to financial services: • Location: Most commercial banks set up their branches in profitable urban commercial areas. • Lack of infrastructure in rural and semi-urban ar- eas: Lack of access to a formal banking outlet, prop- er internet, electricity, etc., are major roadblocks to both consumers and financial institutions. • Rising unemployment and low wages: Financial conditions of people plays a pivotal role in accessing available financial services. • Service charges: High bank charges not only dis- courage people but also create a lack of trust among people using banking and financial services. Financial institutions for inclusion: • Scheduled commercial banks • Regional rural banks • Payment banks • Micro-finance institutions • Business correspondents (Bank Mitra) • Small finance banks Government efforts: • The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) • Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) • Aadhaar Enabled Payment Services (AePS) • Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM)-UPI Key challenges for India: While 80% of the Indian population may have bank accounts, almost 45% of such accounts still remain inactive due to a combination of - Access, Retention and Financial Literacy. Best practices: • Companies such as Vakrangee Ltd., BTI payments, FINO, etc., have provided many banking and ATM services through a technology-driven platform. \t They have managed to boost rural entre- preneurship and increase the level of fi- nancial literacy. • The PM Mudra Yojana provides collateral-free loans up to Rs. 1 million for small and micro en- terprises. Way ahead: • Financial inclusion will reduce the resources that households need to keep in liquid form and there- fore make them available for productive invest- ments to address climate risk. • Climate adaptation requires putting resources in the hands of people because they are best placed to un- derstand climate impacts. A. THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF WOMEN Context: It is challenging to achieve financial inclusion (FI) for women until they actively participate in the formal financial industry. Why do women need FI? • FI is considered a critical indicator of development and is identified as an enabler for at least eight of the 17 SDGs. • For women, access to bank accounts, loans, insur- ance, and other financial services, results in direct improvements in outcomes of health, education, employment → economic independence → em- powerment. • In turn, such progress helps achieve the collective goals of eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive growth, and reducing inequality. The schemes promoting FI in India: The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY): • 56% of all these new accounts are owned by wom- en, which implies remarkable FI that has significant- ly reduced the gender gap, from 17% in 2011 to 6% in 2017. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 79 Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT): • Since its inception in 2013, the Indian government has cumulatively transferred Rs. 16.8 trillion to beneficiaries through DBT. This has led to the FI of women, as they constitute a good number of bene- ficiaries under the schemes. Challenges: • Women still lack participation in the formal financial industry. For example, \t Most women only access their PMJDY ac- counts to withdraw the benefit transfers from the various government initiatives. \t Most of them do not use these accounts for savings, to build a credit history or avail of any financial products such as insurance and loans. • Inaccessibility: Most financial services are beyond the reach of most women, particularly in the rural hinterland. • Concerns around privacy and confidentiality: Hes- itation to discuss personal financial matters with strangers. • The lack of collateral due to limited access to assets and property impedes their ability to avail of loans. • They have less influence over the family’s import- ant financial choices → leading to wastages or use of benefits for non-essential purposes. How to address these concerns? • Promote women’s access to and literacy in digital tools. • Promote the use of digital payments among wom- en. • Appoint more women Business Correspondents (BCs). • Deepen convergence with self-help groups. • Collect gender-disaggregated data and develop strategies to form women-centric approaches. • Promote digital credit for medium and small busi- nesses. Best practice: •\t The Bank Sakhis programme by the National Rural Livelihoods Mission trains SHG members to work as BCs in rural districts. Way ahead: Digital payment solutions can be easily redesigned to en- able access to information that are key stumbling blocks to the FI of women.

Provisional data of the Department of Commerce on agri imports-exports: • Agricultural trade surplus (Exports - Imports): It has marginally dipped from $17.82 billion to $17.46 bil- lion. \t The surplus narrows further if one adds the import of fertilizers, which have risen from $14.17 billion in 2021-22 to $17.21 billion in 2022-23. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 80 The drivers - global prices: • The UN FAO’s Food Price Index (FPI) - a weighted average of world prices of a basket of food commod- ities over a base period value (2014-16 = 100) - re- mains high since 2020-21. • It made India’s agri-commodities more globally price competitive. Major export-import contributors: Export profile: • Basmati exports are mainly to the Persian Gulf countries, while non-basmati shipments are more diversified, spreading across - \t Asia (Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Malay- sia, Vietnam, UAE and Iraq) and \t Africa (from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Benin to Somalia and Madagascar). \t It’s non-basmati that has made India the biggest rice exporter, ahead of Thailand. • In sugar exports, the country has emerged as the world’s No. 2 exporter after Brazil. \t Indian mills have built markets for both raw sugar (among refineries in Bangladesh, In- donesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq) and \t Regular plantation whites (in African coun- tries, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and China). • Spices exports have stagnated since 2020-21. • The exports of raw cotton, guar-gum (a thickening agent used in extraction of shale oil and gas) and oil meals, have declined. Imports profile: • Imports meet roughly 60% of India’s vegetable oil requirements, 10% of pulses. • Imports of spices, cashew and cotton - commodities where India has traditionally been a net exporter - have shown a rising trend. Concerns: • Unfavourable regulatory regime: \t Cultivation of GM Bt cotton and high glob- al prices had enabled India to become the world’s top producer (ahead of China) and No. 2 exporter (after the US) of natural fibre. \t But, as the government is not permitting new gene technologies, the country has turned from a net exporter to an importer of cotton. • Domestic crop shortages: Specially in cotton, soy- abean, guar-gum and oil meal. • Spice imports going up are a reflection of reduced price competitiveness (vis-à-vis Vietnam in pepper and Guatemala in pepper). • Export curbs: The government banned wheat ex- ports, broken rice exports and slapped a 20% duty on all non-parboiled non-basmati shipments. Government steps to promote agricultural exports: • Agriculture Export Policy (2018): It aims to harness export potential of Indian agriculture to make India a global power in agriculture and raise farmers’ income. • ‘District as Export Hub’ Initiative of the Department of Commerce would be utilised to achieve the objec- tives of Agriculture Export Policy. • Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Ag- riculture Products - a Central Sector Scheme to miti- gate the freight disadvantage for the export of agricul- ture products. • Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) • Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme • The Export Promotion Schemes of APEDA Risks ahead: • International prices: The latest FPI reading showing declining trends. • Domestic food inflation, more curbs on exports and a further liberalisation of imports if the ensu- ing southwest monsoon season delivers subnormal rainfall.

It identifies four dimensions that make mitigating environmental im- pacts a difficult task Meaning of agri-commodity value chains: It refers to the entire process of production, processing, distribution, and consumption of agricultural commodities, from farm to fork. “Making Agri-commodity value chains sustainable” means the practice of ensuring that the agricultural value chain minimizes negative environmental and social impacts while promoting long-term economic viability. Need for making agri-commodity value chains sustainable: Making agri-commodity value chains sustainable is essential to protect the environment, ensure long-term agricultural productivity, meet consumer demands, address global sus- tainability challenges, promote stakeholder accountability, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The challenges of ensuring sustainability in agricultural commodity value chains: Challenges Examples Market and produc- er Related E.g., uncertain Export policies; ad- verse WTO norms influencing Indi- an farmers; uncertain MSP by the government Production related The production process, including land-use strategies, seed quality, and input usage, varies across differ- ent commodities. Lack of specific in- tervention by farmers suited to the specific production systems, such as intensive or extensive agriculture or agroforestry, leads to low yield. Weak policies Weak governance mechanisms, subsidies, market access, and infra- structural support for Indian agricul- ture Marginalized farm- ers Poor Working conditions for mar- ginalized tenants, almost no labour rights, and inequity for Indian farm- ers www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 82 Few Government Initiatives for sustainable agriculture: Scheme Objective Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana Promote organic farming National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) Promote climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural prac- tices such as conservation ag- riculture, agroforestry, inte- grated farming systems, etc. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sin- chayee Yojana Improve water use efficiency in agriculture Soil Health Card Scheme Encourage balanced and judi- cious use of fertilizers National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) Promote sustainable produc- tion of oilseeds and oil palm National Agricultural Mar- ket (e-NAM) Create a unified national mar- ket for agricultural commod- ities Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) Develop agri-processing clus- ters and infrastructure to in- crease value addition and re- duce post-harvest losses What should be done: The production process, including land-use strategies and inputs, varies across commodities, requiring tailored inter- ventions. Strong governance mechanisms and policies, in- cluding subsidies and regulations, can support sustainable value chains. Additionally, an inclusive approach is neces- sary, considering working conditions, labour rights, equity, and the effects of the climate crisis on production. Conclusion: There is a need to address the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability in the context of ag- ricultural production, processing, and distribution.

Reasons: With delays in rainfall and labour shortages, this method al- lows farmers to sow seeds without waiting for rain or spend- ing time in nurseries. What is Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)? DSR, also known as the ‘broadcasting seed technique,’ is a method in which seeds are directly drilled into the fields. There is no nursery preparation or transplantation involved in this method. Technique: In this technique, farmers level the land, provide one pre-sowing irrigation, and then sow the rice seeds directly into the field instead of transplanting seedlings. Advantages of DSR over Traditional Agriculture: Advantages Direct Seeding Method (DSR) Traditional Agricul- ture Water Con- servation Dir e c t -se e ding method reduces wa- ter requirement by about 15%. Relies heavily on flood irrigation, leading to water wastage Labour Effi- ciency Requires fewer la- bourers for nursery preparation and transplantation Requires a signifi- cant workforce for nursery and trans- planting Time Savings Eliminates the need for nursery prepara- tion and transplant- ing time Requires time for nursery preparation and transplanting Yield Poten- tial Can result in high- er yields due to im- proved crop man- agement Yield may vary based on crop man- agement and envi- ronmental factors Soil Health Helps prevent the development of hard crust beneath the plough layer Puddling can lead to soil compaction and reduced soil health Crop Resi- due Manage- ment Allows for better management of crop residue Crop residue man- agement can be challenging in tradi- tional methods Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 83 Limitations of DSR: • Weed Management Challenges: DSR often requires multiple sprays of weedicides to control weed growth. In comparison, flood irrigation in the traditional meth- od acts as a natural weedicide. • Vulnerability to Climate Extremes: DSR may be more susceptible to extreme weather conditions, such as high temperatures and deficient rainfall. • Crop Residue Management: Unlike traditional agricul- ture, where rice straw is removed after harvest, DSR leaves the crop residue in the field. • Variability in Yield: The success of DSR can vary depend- ing on factors like farmer expertise, soil type, and envi- ronmental conditions. • Initial Learning Curve: Transitioning from traditional agriculture to DSR may require farmers to acquire new knowledge and skills. •\t The seed requirement for DSR is also higher than transplanting. •\t Land levelling is compulsory in DSR, therefore, in- creasing the cost.

Challenges the world is facing - Conflict between food secu- rity and environmental protection: • Agriculture is responsible for a quarter of the car- bon emissions and the vast majority of the world’s biodiversity losses. • However, there is the need to increase food pro- duction (by 50%), as the world’s population keeps growing [will reach 10 billion in 2057 (as per UN es- timates)]. Approaches to achieving food security and mitigating cli- mate crisis: • Dietary changes to make consumption more sus- tainable. • Better technologies to create more environmentally friendly methods of agriculture. Gene technologies are a crucial part of the strategy for a sustainable food system. What is GM food? • Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are organ- isms that have altered DNA to change their proper- ties. • Foods produced from or using GMOs are often re- ferred to as GM foods/crops. • GMOs were first introduced in the US in 1994, to prolong the shelf life of tomato plants. • Since then, GM soybeans, wheat and rice have been approved for agricultural use. • Currently, GM crop production uses ~10% of the land as compared to non-GM crops. Advantages: • Can improve yield, delay ripening to prolong their shelf life, builds resistance to disease/pests, frost, or drought, or adds nutrients. • Can be modified to reduce carbon emissions and boost the sustainability of food production. GM controversy: • Uncertainty (over-regulation) and concerns about safety (long-term impact on human-animal health and biodiversity). • The monopoly of big corporations (like Monsanto) → expensive GM seeds. GM crops in India: • Indian farmers started cultivating Bt cotton - a pest-resistant, GM version of cotton, in 2002-03. \t By 2014, around 96% of the area under cot- ton cultivation in India was Bt cotton, mak- ing India the 4th-largest cultivator of GM crops by acreage and the 2nd largest pro- ducer of cotton. • The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 84 (GEAC) cleared the environmental release of mus- tard hybrid Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH-11) for its seed production and testing • Indian scientists have also developed strains of Sub- 1 rice, which are much more resistant to flooding. • Golden rice is a GM strain modified to contain vita- min A, to combat the shortage of dietary vitamin A in parts of Asia and Africa. Way ahead: • The focus of GM products must be on the social and public enterprise. • The industry must look at more local solutions that help smallholder farmers in developing countries. • Easy availability of open-source seeds and GM tech- nologies. • Creating a licensing landscape that empowers lo- cal farmers to adapt to the demands of sustainable agriculture, to meet rising populations and climate change.

What is AMR? It refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, to resist the effects of anti- microbial drugs, such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs. E.g., New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) superbug Status of AMR: It was responsible for nearly 5 million global deaths in 2019 and is projected to cause over 2mn death by 2050 in India alone. Yet the development of new antibiotics is limited, and access to existing treatments remains a challenge. What does the Report say: • AMR remains one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity • 1 in 5 deaths caused by AMR occurred in children under the age of 5. • If no action is taken, AMR could cost the world’s econo- my USD 100 trillion by 2050. • Recommendations by the report: increased investments in research and development, alignment of financing mechanisms, and global efforts to ensure equitable ac- cess to antibiotics. What are the problems with AMR in India? AMR is a particular challenge in India due to the high burden of communicable diseases, an overburdened public health system, limited laboratory capacity, inexpensive and widely available antibiotics without prescriptions, Excessive use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming etc Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 85 Other initiatives: • India: National Action Plan on AMR (NAP-AMR) for 2017-2021 (updating it for 2022-2026) • Global: One Health Quadripartite: In 2021, the FAO, UNEP, WHO and World Organisation for Animal Health joined to combat AMR. Conclusion: There is a need for priority actions to accelerate progress, including commitments at the high-level meeting on AMR at the United Nations General Assembly in 2024 and targeted financing mechanisms to address the crisis and ensure equi- table access to antibiotics.

Transparency and credibil- ity Lack of public disclosure of drug applica- tion reviews. Environmen- tal sustain- ability E.g., Implementing green chemistry and waste reduction measures has been found to be non-existent. In India, drugs and cosmetics are regulated by: •\t Act: Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules 1945: It assigns various responsibilities to central and state regulators. •\t Agencies: \t Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI): It is responsible for approving licenses for specified categories of drugs, setting standards for manufacturing, sales, import, www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 86 and distribution of drugs in India, and heads the department of CDSCO. \t Central Drugs Standard Control Organisa- tion (CDSCO): It prescribes standards for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs, cosmetics, diagnostics, and devices. It also regulates the market authorization of new drugs and clinical trial standards. \t National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA): It controls the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs in India Steps that can be taken by the government: Steps Description Amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) Modify the existing legislation to align it with current requirements and en- hance regulatory oversight. Create a central- ized drug data- base Establish a comprehensive database to facilitate effective surveillance of all pharmaceutical manufacturers. Merge India’s 36 regional regula- tors Consolidate the regional regulatory authorities into a unified entity to streamline the regulatory process and reduce the risk of inconsistent en- forcement. Set common quality standards across states Implement uniform quality standards across all states to ensure consistent product quality and reduce the risk of varying regulatory enforcement. Increase budget- ary support Allocate additional funds to strength- en inspection teams and conduct more frequent inspections related to product quality. Impose clear pen- alties for firms ex- porting spurious drugs Establish strict penalties for compa- nies involved in exporting counterfeit or substandard drugs. This will deter such practices and safeguard public health. Create a public database of safe- ty data Develop a comprehensive safety da- tabase that contains information on drug-related adverse events, side ef- fects, and other safety concerns. Enact a national law on drug recall This will ensure swift and effective recall processes, protecting the public from potentially harmful drugs. Strengthen CDS- CO Strengthen the Central Drugs Stan- dard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and provide it with statutory backing WHO’s Good Ma n u fa ct u ri n g Practice certifica- tion Promote and incentivize pharmaceu- tical manufacturers to adhere to the WHO’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. Conclusion: Indian government can enhance the quality and regulation of the pharmaceutical industry through legislative amend- ments, centralized drug databases, and the merging of regu- lators. It will build confidence, ensure high-quality generics, and uphold India’s reputation as a reliable supplier, benefit- ing both domestic and global healthcare while protecting public health.

What is AI? AI stands for artificial intelligence, which is the ability of ma- chines to learn and perform tasks that normally require hu- man intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding. What is GPT? Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 87 UK Adopts a ‘light-touch’ approach that aims to foster innovation in the AI industry. Japan Takes an accommodative approach to AI devel- opers. China Drafted a 20-point draft to regulate generative AI services that are likely to be enforced later this year. India ICMR releases guidelines for artificial intel- ligence use in the health sector; Niti Aayog’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence and the Responsible AI for All report. India is not considering any law to regulate AI currently. In- dia’s AI penetration factor at 3.09, the highest among all G20, OECD countries US Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that proposed a nonbinding roadmap for the responsible use of AI. The Blueprint spelt out five core princi- ples to govern the effective development of AI systems. Conclusion: Although the risks of AI are widely known, it remains un- clear how the proposed AI Bill of Rights would address these risks and how grievances would be remedied. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and over 15,000 others have called for a six-month pause in AI development, and for shared safety protocols to be implemented by labs and independent experts.

Bring down electricity consumption in industrial units 2. Create meaningful short stories and songs 3. Disease diagnosis 4. Text-to-Speech Conversion 5. Wireless transmission of electrical energy Select the correct answer using the code given below: (a) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only (b) 1, 3 and 4 only (c) 2, 4 and 5 only (d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Ans: B Concerns related to rising AI software and chatbots: Concerns Explanation Privacy There is a risk that personal and sensi- tive information data could be used for unethical purposes, such as for target- ed advertising or for political manipu- lation. Responsibility Since AI models can generate new con- tent, such as images, audio, or text it may be used to generate fake news or other malicious content, without know- ing who is responsible for the output. This could lead to ethical dilemmas over responsibility. Au t o ma ti o n and Lowering of Job AI has the potential to automate many processes, which could lead to job dis- placement for people who are skilled in those areas. Bias and Dis- crimination AI can be trained on biased data, which can result in the algorithm making deci- sions that unfairly disadvantage certain groups. This can perpetuate societal in- equalities and lead to discrimination. Lack of Trans- parency and Ac- countability There are concerns about who should be held responsible for the actions of AI systems - creators of the AI systems, the companies that deploy them, or the governments that regulate them. Various steps taken by countries to regulate AI are: Country Initiative G7 The EU’s “risk-based” regulation of AI refers to the proposed AI Act that seeks to regulate artificial intelligence tools based on their level of risk. The act categorizes AI systems into four categories: • Unacceptable risk (e.g., in case of critical infrastructure) • high risk • limited risk • minimal risk (e.g., spam filters, word pro- cessing) The level of risk determines the degree of reg- ulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements that the AI system would be subject to. EU The proposed AI Act segregates artificial intel- ligence by use-case scenarios based broadly on the degree of invasiveness and risk. The AI Act is due next year. Italy Became the first major Western country to ban Open AI’s ChatGPT out of concerns over priva- cy. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 88 19.DECENTRALISED RENEWABLE ENERGY (DRE) TECHNOLOGIES Context: According to a new report, technologies that are powered by DRE could potentially impact 37 million livelihoods in India’s agriculture and textile sectors. DRE: Energy that is generated close to where it will be used and typically uses renewable energy sources, including small hydro, combined heat and power (CHP), biomass, solar and wind power. DRE technologies include: Solar-run textile manufacturing units, biomass-powered cold solar storages and micro solar pumps, etc. Current status in India: • India has 12 mature technologies powered by DRE. • There are 5.5 lakh installations of these 12 technol- ogies, with an estimated livelihood impact of 5.6 lakh people. Potential: • DRE has a market potential of Rs 4 lakh crore in ru- ral and peri-urban communities in India and can im- pact 37 million livelihoods. • Solar-powered technologies have the maximum po- tential to be deployed (UP leads in terms of estimat- ed future adoption). • Solar pumps are the most mature technologies due to the government subsidies provided. Positive impacts of using DRE technologies: Barriers to DRE tech adoption: • The commercial viability of such solutions, which are capital intensive in nature. • One barrier faced by the users is the lack of direct contact with the manufacturers to address technol- ogy defects. Way ahead: • Assessment of demand: It will help in mapping the needs of beneficiaries with appropriate fit to DRE livelihood applications. • R&D and standardisation: To offer tailor-made solu- tions important for their widespread adoption. • Pilot and up-scaling: It is vital to ascertain the suc- cess of any technology innovation on the ground. • Access to finance: \t Introducing long-period, low-interest loans to users to enable ease of adoption of such solutions. \t State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs) can leverage their existing institutional set- up to provide financial support for the wom- en SHG members. • Skill development and capacity building: \t This has the potential of creating new local job opportunities in operations, mainte- nance and installation/fabrication. \t Linkages will be established in existing gov- ernment schemes like MUDRA to support micro-entrepreneurship in the value chain for DRE livelihood applications. • Public information and awareness ACHIEVEMENTS OF INDIANS IN SCI- ENCE & TECHNOLOGY 20.INDIA’S WOMEN IN SCIENCE Context: Two books - Lilavati’s Daughters (2008) and Lab Hopping (2023) - highlight the complicated relationship between sci- ence and gender in India. Some notable women scientists of India: Anandibai Joshi (India’s first woman physician), Iravati Karve (India’s first woman anthropologist), Anna Mani (India’s first woman me- teorologist), Dr N Kalaiselvi (currently, at the helm of CSIR), V R Lalithambika (leading the Gaganyaan mission) Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 89 Data on women in science in India: As per the latest “Re- search and Development Statistics 2019-20” of the Depart- ment of Science and Technology (DST), India has 16.6% of women researchers directly engaged in R&D activities. The obstacles that hold women back include: • Lack of representation, deeply entrenched patriarchy • Institutional apathy • Poor working conditions, sexual harassment • Familial issues like marriage, family responsibility (twin burden of home and the workplace), relocation due to transferable job of the spouse, etc. Impact: Dropout from higher studies, career break, overage for sci- entific jobs and prolonged absence from place of work or even resignation from the job. The government has taken several corrective steps: • Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing (KIRAN) Scheme: Instituted to encourage women in the field of S&T. \t Women Scientist Scheme (WOS) under KIRAN provides career opportunities, es- pecially for those who had a break in their career. \t The Mobility Scheme under KIRAN ad- dresses relocation issues of working women scientists and provides support in project mode for 2-5 years. • Consolidation of University Research through Inno- vation and Excellence in Women Universities (CU- RIE) Programme. • Indo-US Fellowship for Women in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) encourages Indian women scientists to undertake international collaborative research. • Vigyan Jyoti Scheme: Encourages girl students of Class 9 to 12 to pursue education and career in S&T. • Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orien- tation Programme (BioCARe) of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). • National Award for woman scientist: To recognize the contribution of women scientists in the field of Earth System Sciences. • Multifaceted initiatives (like Women Entrepreneur’s Quest (WEQ) Programme) have been launched by DST to encourage women’s entrepreneurship under Start-up India-Stand up India. Conclusion: STEMM is the prime engine that have steered national growth and created a self-reliant India. Hence, equal partic- ipation of both men and women in STEMM will help India realise ‘Amrit Kaal’ in the true sense.

Issues faced by NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System): • Atomic clock failure: Several of the existing satellites stopped providing location data after their onboard atomic clocks failed • Satellite Replacement: Some of the satellites in the NAVIC constellation have reached the end of their mis- sion life or become partially defunct. • Limited Coverage: While NAVIC provides coverage over the Indian landmass and a radius of 1,500 km around it, there is a need for further expansion and ground sta- tions outside India to improve coverage and accuracy in hard-to-reach areas. • User Segment Development: There has been a delay in the development of user receivers for the NAVIC system, resulting in limited utilization of the navigation services. • Mobile Compatibility: Mobile phones in India currently lack compatibility to process NAVIC signals, limiting the widespread use of the system. • Security and Encryption: Ensuring the security of NAVIC signals and preventing breaches or spoofing is a signifi- cant challenge. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 90 New features of the Satellite are (to overcome some of the issues): • L1 Frequency: The inclusion of the L1 frequency (besides L5 and S frequency) enhances compatibility with wear- able devices and personal trackers. The inclusion of L1 frequency also increases interoperability with other sat- ellite-based navigation systems. • Longer mission life: The second-generation satellites will also have a longer mission life of more than 12 years. The existing satellites have a mission life of 10 years. • Rubidium atomic clock: The atomic clock ensures ac- curate positioning, addressing a previous issue faced by satellites in the constellation • The heaviest in the constellation of NAVIC satellites ( will be launched by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket): Previous satellites were much lighter and launched on PSLV. The higher weight allow- ance allows for more instruments and fuel to be loaded. NavIC’s advantages over other systems: Advantages Explanation Regional Cover- age India is the only country that has a re- gional satellite-based navigation system (there are four global satellite-based navigation systems — the American GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the Europe- an Galileo, and the Chinese Beidou Higher Accura- cy Once fully operational, NavIC open sig- nals are expected to provide accuracy up to 5 meters, surpassing GPS accuracy (20 meters). Geo-stationary Satellites Unlike GPS, NavIC uses satellites in high geo-stationery orbit, ensuring constant coverage over the designated region. Improved Sig- nal Reception NavIC signals arrive in India at a 90-de- gree angle, making them easier to re- ceive even in congested or obstructed areas (unlike GPS). Indigenous De- velopment NavIC is developed by ISRO, showcasing India’s technological capabilities and re- ducing dependence on foreign systems. Why a regional navigation system matters to India: Examples Strategic Inde- pendence India’s NavIC system operates inde- pendently without relying on GPS or other global systems. National Secu- rity NavIC enables precise tracking and nav- igation for defence operations and mili- tary applications. Disaster Man- agement NavIC helps in tracking and responding to natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods. Transportation and Navigation NavIC enables precise tracking of com- mercial vehicles, enhancing road safety and efficiency. Precision Ag- riculture and Farming NavIC aids farmers in optimizing crop management, irrigation, and soil nutri- ent application. Personal and Public Safety NavIC enables real-time tracking of fish- ermen and sends alerts in case of po- tential dangers at sea. Scientific and Te chnological Advancements NavIC aids in scientific experiments, geological surveys, and geodetic net- work development. Conclusion: Currently, NavIC’s reach extends only 1,500 km beyond In- dian territory. However, for applications involving ships and aeroplanes travelling beyond this range, satellites in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) would be required. By adding MEO satel- lites in the future, NavIC can extend its global reach and aim to provide navigation services on a global scale, similar to the capabilities of the GPS system. Mains Links: Q.

What is Globalization in the context of the Environment? Globalization, in terms of the environment, refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of economies and societies worldwide, leading to the global exchange of goods, services, information, and ideas. It has both positive and negative environmental impacts. Why is Globalization Necessary for decarbonization? Aspect Reasons Example Resource Dis- tribution The materials and resources are not evenly distributed globally. Globaliza- tion allows for the efficient sourcing and trading of re- sources from areas with abundant sup- ply to areas with high demand. E.g., Lithium, is pri- marily sourced from Australia and Chile, and its global avail- ability is essential for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles Technological Innovation Globalization pro- motes the ex- change of knowl- edge, ideas, and technological ad- vancements across borders. E.g., Sharing of R&D in renewable energy technologies like so- lar panels and wind turbines has accel- erated their deploy- ment and reduced costs globally. Access to Fi- nancing Globalization al- lows for cross-bor- der financial flows, making it easier for countries to access the necessary cap- ital and investment for decarbonization projects. E.g., the global car- bon credit trading mechanism S c a l a b i l i t y and Econo- mies of Scale Globalization en- ables the estab- lishment of global supply chains, al- lowing for large- scale manufactur- ing and distribution of renewable ener- gy technologies. E.g., Tesla compa- ny’s Giga factory for the manufacture of EV batteries in Chi- na, Australia and the USA K no wle dg e Sharing and Policy Align- ment Globalization facili- tates the sharing of best practices, ex- pertise, and policy frameworks among countries. E.g., Paris Agree- ment, International Solar Alliance etc., How globalization leads to a negative impact on the envi- ronment: Negative Impact Description Carbon Emis- sions Globalized trade increases carbon emissions from shipping, air travel, and long-distance transportation of goods. E.g., importing goods from dis- tant countries to meet consumer de- mands leads to increased emissions from transportation. De for est a tion and Habitat Loss Global demand for commodities like timber, soy, and palm oil drives defor- estation and habitat loss in regions with rich biodiversity. E.g., the expansion of palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia has led to extensive deforestation and the loss of critical ecosystems. Pollution and Waste E.g., the export of electronic waste from developed to developing coun- tries for recycling often leads to im- proper disposal and pollution. Overconsump- tion of Resourc- es Globalization and increased trade have fueled a culture of consumerism, lead- ing to higher resource consumption. Loss of Cultural Diversity Globalization can lead to the homoge- nization of cultures, eroding tradition- al practices and knowledge that are often environmentally sustainable. Few major efforts for sustainable globalization: Corporate Sustainability Initiatives; Circular Economy Tran- sition; Sustainable Trade Initiatives (WTO); and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Conclusion: Balancing the benefits of globalization with environmental sustainability requires careful consideration and implemen- www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 92 tation of policies and practices that mitigate its negative effects while maximizing its positive contributions to decar- bonization and environmental protection.

Methane (CH4) • A greenhouse gas (GHG) responsible for 30% of the warming since preindustrial times, second only to car- bon dioxide (CO2). • However, it is 80 times more potent at warming than CO2. • Agriculture, fossil fuels as well as solid waste and wastewater are the three major sources of methane. • In India (3rd largest emitter of CH4) ~20% of its an- thropogenic CH4 emissions come from agriculture (manure management), coal mines, municipal solid waste, etc. • According to the IPCC, the world must cut methane emissions by at least 30 % by 2030. Efforts to curb methane emissions Global India Global Methane Pledge - Both the US and the EU have planned to cut methane emissions by 30% (by 2030) compared with the 2020 levels. According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, a nationwide strategy to boost biogas production has re- ceived significant funding. UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Ob- servatory (IMEO) strate- gy - To get policy-relevant data into the right hands for emissions mitigation. ICAR’s National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project: Technologies (like System for Rice Intensi- fication, Direct Seeded Rice) were developed to reduce methane emissions. Methane Alert and Re- sponse System (MARS) - Launched at the COP27 to the UNFCCC in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt Crop Diversification Pro- gramme: Methane emissions are avoided due to the di- version of paddy to alternate crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize, cotton, and agro-forest- ry. Highlights of the study: • Since the 1980s, the rate of increase in methane emissions is higher than ever before. • Methane policies are actions by governments that explicitly aim to monitor, prevent, or reduce meth- ane emissions from anthropogenic sources. • 90% of identified national policies were from three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. • The policies targeting fossil methane (coal, oil, and gas) are lower than biogenic methane (released by living organisms). Concerns: • This trend has emerged despite readily available solutions to cut methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector. • Impact of methane mitigation policies on industries (like agriculture) important to the national economy, energy and food security or rural poverty consider- ations. India-specific findings: • No effective policies targeting methane emissions from rice cultivation and biomass burning (burning of crop residues). • While policies targeting biomass burning have quite broad coverage, their implementation remains challenging. \t For example, the 1997 Coalbed methane policy was ineffective in incentivising coal- bed methane production. Way ahead: • The policies should focus on super emitters, which are facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure, typically in the fossil-fuel, waste, or agriculture sec- tors, that emit methane at high rates. • While reducing livestock or rice-production-related emissions is challenging, India can contribute by re- ducing emissions associated with coal production.

Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 93 Debt-for-climate/debt-for-nature swaps Meaning It is a debt restructuring device between the creditor and a debtor by which the for- mer forgoes a portion of the latter’s foreign debt/provides its debt relief, in return for a commitment to invest in specific environ- mental mitigation and adaptation projects. Who will be benefitted? • Low and middle-income countries, small island developing states (SIDS). • Example - Caribbean SIDS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 73% drop in international tourist arrivals in 2020, and has aggravated the region’s debt crisis. Need • These countries are most vulnerable to climate change and are least able to af- ford the investment to strengthen resil- ience due to their debt burden. • The signatories to the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) have a commitment to provide financial assistance to de- veloping countries to build clean, cli- mate-resilient futures. Advantages • Dual objectives: to promote specific in- vestment and policy action (that aims to combat climate change) on the one hand and some debt relief on the other. • Seeks to free up fiscal resources → Governments can improve resilience without triggering a fiscal crisis or sac- rificing spending on other development priorities. • Developed countries can fulfil their commitments (to support developing countries) through this attractive and transparent instrument. Swap vs c ondition grants Swap: Offer debt relief above what is need- ed to finance the climate investments (net debt relief), leading to a higher fiscal trans- fer and the creation of fiscal space. Conditional grants: Cover the cost of an in- vestment and require economic dislocation → diversion of resources from planned de- velopment programmes. Successful implemen- tation (Seychelles) • In 2017, this small African country an- nounced the successful conclusion of negotiations for a debt-for-adaptation swap under a tripartite model. • The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a US- based environmental organisation, bought $22 million of its debt in ex- change for a promise to create 13 new marine protected areas. Way ahead Countries like Sri Lanka [ranked as highly vulnerable to climate change catastrophes and also reeling under the sovereign debt crisis] can seek the help of these instru- ments. 25.GREEN ENERGY OPEN ACCESS RULES, 2022 Context: Union Power & NRE Ministry, urged industry leaders to set green targets and report violations of Green Energy Open Access Rules.

Groundwater situation in India: • It is India’s most used water resource, accounting for a quarter of total global groundwater extraction. • According to the 2021 CAG report, groundwater ex- traction in India (annual use - ~433 billion cubic metres) has exceeded the recharge rate, threatening 80% of po- table water over the next two decades. What is land subsidence? Land subsidence is defined as the progressive or abrupt sinking of the earth’s surface caused by the elimination or dislocation of subsurface earth components (like aquifers) triggered by natural/human activity. How is groundwater extraction linked to sinking land? When the underlying aquifers - deep water channels that are stores of percolated water, aren’t recharged, they run dry. Hence, the layers of soil and rock above them start to sink and the issue is not specific to north India alone. How severe is the problem in India? • Data from the Sentinel-1 satellite shows that the NCR region sank 15 mm per year (on average) be- tween 2011-2017. • Urbanisation and unplanned growth were major factors → exacerbated groundwater withdrawal → land sinking. Impact: • If land sinking is expanded out over a large area, this could imply that the region will become flood- prone. • However, if the pace of sinking varies, it could have an effect on civil facilities such as roads, buildings, and residences. • It may cause fundamentals to deteriorate or cracks to form in buildings. Detecting the link between groundwater and land subsid- ence: • The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) - a subsid- iary body of the Jal Shakti Ministry, does not analyse the consequences of ‘over-exploitation’ • This link only started to become clear from the data of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experi- ment) satellites that could measure minute changes in gravity on different parts of the Earth’s surface. Why is it difficult to detect the link? • Unlike land movement from landslides or earth- quakes, it is gradual and barely visible annually. • So, it is harder to correlate with structural damage. What needs to be done? • There needs to be greater recognition that ground- water exploitation has consequences other than wa- ter scarcity. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 95 • The government and policymakers should have a de- tailed understanding of the geophysical properties of the areas undergoing subsidence. • Incentivising rainwater harvesting, ensuring strict implementation of laws against illegal mining of groundwater, evaluating building conditions in haz- ard zones and provisioning of such subsidence in building designs. Some initiatives International National • The United Na- tions-Water Sum- mit on Groundwater 2022: Organised to raise awareness on groundwater conser- vation. • “Groundwater: Mak- ing the invisible visi- ble” campaign run by UN-Water throughout 2022. • Atal Bhujal Yojana is a groundwater manage- ment scheme launched in 2019. • Jal Shakti Abhiyan (2019): Launched in 256 water-stressed districts to improve groundwater conditions in these areas. • Aquifer Mapping and Management Pro- gramme Insta Links: UN Groundwater Summit 2022 to help raise awareness on aquifer protection, sustainable use Mains Links: Q.

Status of Cities in terms of their greenness, resilience, and inclusiveness (as per the report): Aspect Findings Example Greenness Cities in high- and up- per-middle-income countries contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emis- sions. Cities in North Amer- ica are among the largest per capita emitters of green- house gases. Resilience Cities in low- and lower-middle-income countries face the highest exposure to climate change-relat- ed hazards. Cities in Bangladesh and India are more vulnerable to floods, heat stress, and cy- clones, resulting in severe economic consequences. Inclusive- ness Lack of inclusive- ness contributes to the vulnerability and lack of resilience in cities of low- and lower-middle-income countries. Cities in low- and l ower-mi d d l e-i n - come countries of- ten struggle with inadequate access to healthcare, edu- cation, and essential utilities such as wa- ter and electricity. Air Pollu- tion Cities in low- and middle-income coun- tries have higher lev- els of air pollution, particularly PM2.5, compared to cities in high-income coun- tries. Delhi, Kanpur, Pat- na etc. have expe- rienced high levels of PM2.5, especially during the winter season Vertical De- velopment and Pros- perity Cities that develop vertically consume less land, accommo- date more people, and show increased prosperity. New York City, have higher population density and eco- nomic activity com- pared to cities with sprawled develop- ment. Lack of Vegetation and Heat Impact Cities with less veg- etation, particularly in upper-middle-in- come countries, experience exacer- bated impacts from extreme heat events and urban heat island effects. Cities like Tokyo, with limited green spaces, face high- er temperatures during heat waves due to the lack of vegetation and in- creased heat reten- tion. Five sets of instruments to improve the greenness, resil- ience, and inclusiveness of cities (as recommended by the report): 5 I’s Description Example Information Policies and measures to provide credible and timely informa- tion to individuals, businesses, and local governments about climate change risks, mitigation and adap- tation measures Establishing a cli- mate change in- formation centre to provide climate risks data specific to their city. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 96 Incentives It includes remov- ing subsidies that encourage activities with negative envi- ronmental external- ities, Implementing tax incentives or re- bates for installing energy-efficient tech- nologies FAME I and II scheme, EU’s Car- bon Border Adjust- ment Mechanism (CBAM) Insurance Developing climate risk insurance schemes that provide coverage for businesses and households against losses from extreme weather events, encouraging investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and en- abling quick recovery. Integration Policy interventions promoting compact cities and better inte- gration between ur- ban and rural areas; Developing efficient public transportation networks that con- nect urban and rural areas E.g., Smart City mission, PURA Scheme (provide urban amenities and livelihood op- portunities in rural areas) Investments Investments by na- tional and local gov- ernments in green, resilient, and inclu- sive urban infrastruc- ture. This includes na- ture-based solutions and measures to at- tract private-sector fi- nance for sustainable development. Allocating funds for the construction of green buildings, renewable energy projects, and ur- ban parks. Conclusion: Addressing the challenges of climate change and creating sustainable cities requires a multi-faceted approach. It in- volves prioritizing green practices, building resilience to cli- mate impacts, and promoting inclusiveness in urban devel- opment. Taking action at the city level is crucial in mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for gener- ations to come. Definitions: Greenness: Greenness refers to the environmental sus- tainability and ecological balance of a city. Resilience: Resilience refers to the ability of a city to withstand and recover from shocks, stresses, and climate change impacts. nclusiveness: Inclusiveness refers to creating cities that are socially and economically equitable, where all individ- uals and communities have equal access to opportunities, resources, and services.

The outcome of the Congress: It recognised climate change as a threat to human health and endorsed a 10-year plan - The 2023-2033 Implementation Plan for Advancing Climate, Environment and Health Science and Services by the WHO-WMO, to scale up health services. About the plan: Aim: To achieve better health and well-being for people fac- ing existing and emerging extreme weather events, climate change and environmental risks. How? • Through the effective integration of climate, envi- ronment and health science and services across the world. • It will promote a coordinated approach to manag- ing the impact of climate, weather, air pollution, ul- traviolet radiation, extreme events, etc., on health. Significance: It is significant when • Climate-related illnesses (like malaria and dengue), premature deaths, malnutrition and threats to men- tal health and well-being are increasing. • Climate-related cascading risks of extreme heat (15,000 people died in Europe in 2022), wildfire and air quality-related health risks are increasing. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 97 Significance for India: • In 2022, India recorded its hottest March which triggered an early onslaught of heat waves across north, central and east India from March-May. • Extreme heat will oust 600 million Indians from their climate niche, exposing them to extreme tem- peratures by 2030. Challenges: Way ahead: • The Early Warnings for All initiative: Extreme heat is a focus area of this UN initiative, which is one of the top strategic priorities at Cg-19.

What is energy justice? Energy justice envisions elements of a global energy system that fairly distributes both en- ergy services’ benefits and burdens and can be used as a framework to identify energy injustices. Short-term actions towards ensuring energy justice in In- dia: • Massive cuts in excise duty and VAT rates of petrol and diesel. • An export cess on petrol, diesel and ATF. • Windfall tax on domestically produced petroleum products to prevent refiners and producers from profiteering at the cost of domestic consumers. • Subsidised administered pricing mechanism (APM) gas for the city gas distribution sector was drastically increased. • Revising the New Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014 to rationalise and reform APM gas pricing. Outcome: • Prices of diesel in India have gone down in the last year: This is when petrol and diesel prices went up by 35-40% in global markets, India imports over 85% of its crude oil requirements and 55% of its natural gas requirements. • No shortage of fuel anywhere in India: This is when several neighbourhood countries have had dry outs and power cuts to manage demand. Long-term actions towards ensuring energy justice: 1. Expanding the network of crude oil suppliers: This strategic decision not only ensured affordable ener- gy for Indian consumers but also had a calming effect on global petroleum markets. 2. Strengthening ties: With countries like the US (energy trade has gone up 13 times in the last four years) and Russia to ensure a reli- able supply of crude oil. Expanding petrochemical production: • India is a global exporter of petroleum products and its refining capacity is the fourth largest in the world after the US, China, and Russia. • Efforts are underway to further enhance this capaci- ty to 450 MMT by 2040. 3. Innovation and investments in exploration and produc- tion (E&P): India wants to boost its net geographic area under explo- ration from 8% to 15% (0.5 million sq km) by 2025 and has reduced the prohibited/no-go areas in EEZ by 99%. 4. Energy transition: However, as demonstrated at Glasgow, India is committed to becoming net-zero in emissions by 2070. 5. Moving towards a gas-based economy: ● By increasing the share of gas from the current 6.3 to 15% by 2030. ● India has connected more than 9.5 crore families with clean cooking fuel in the past nine years. ● PNG connections have increased from 22.28 lakh in 2014 to over 1 crore in 2023. ● The number of CNG stations in India has gone up from 938 in 2014 to 4,900 in 2023. ● Since 2014, India has increased the length of its gas pipeline network from 14,700 km to 22,000 km in 2023. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 98 6. Biofuel revolution: ● At the recent India Energy Week 2023, India launched E20 - 20% ethanol blended gasoline - which will be expanded across the country in the next two years. ● India’s ethanol-blending gasoline has grown from just 1.53% in 2013-14 to 10.17% in 2023. ● India is also setting up five 2nd generation ethanol plants, which can convert agricultural waste into biofuel → reducing pollution due to stubble burning → generating income for farmers. 7. Developing the entire green hydrogen ecosystem: ● The National Green Hydrogen Mission has been launched with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to accel- erate India’s efforts towards - ○ 4 MT of annual green hydrogen production and ○ Rs 1 lakh crore of fossil fuel import savings by 2030. 8. An integrated path for transitioning India’s future mobil- ity pathways: ● Along with green hydrogen and biofuels, India is also supporting electric vehicles through a produc- tion-linked incentive scheme. ● India is targeting the installation of alternative fuel stations (EV charging/CNG/ LPG/LNG/CBG etc.) at 22,000 retail outlets by May 2024. Conclusion: ● According to IEA estimates, India will account for ~25% of global energy demand growth between 2020-2040. ● As India aspires to become a $26 trillion economy by 2047, implementing a unique strategy for ensur- ing energy security and achieving energy indepen- dence is the need of the hour.

(UPSC 2018) 30.THE ROLE OF SMALL MODULAR REAC- TORS IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION Context: The NITI Aayog recently released a report on ‘The Role of Small Modular Reactors in the Energy Transition’. Background: • Apart from Renewable Energy (RE), nuclear is also being explored as a clean energy option to help the nations in achieving their decarbonisation goals. • The IEA has projected the global nuclear-installed pow- er capacity to rise from 413 GW in 2021 to 871 GW by 2050. • Innovation in nuclear reactor technologies, both in Large Reactors (LRs) and in the newer concept of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) will be important. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) SMRs are Small - physically a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor. Modular - making it possible for systems and components to be factory-assem- bled and transported as a unit to a loca- tion for installation. Reactors - harnessing nuclear fission to generate heat for electricity production or direct application. Capacity Ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe. Classification Land-based water-cooled SMRs, Marine based water cooled SMRs, High-tem- perature gas-cooled SMRs (HTGRs), Liq- uid metal-cooled fast neutron spectrum SMRs (LMFRs), etc Status of de- v el o p men t (globally) At present, nearly 80 SMR designs are in the development and licensing stages, and a few of them are in the deployment and operational stages. Advantages Manufactured off-site: This can signifi- cantly save construction time, unlike the conventional nuclear reactors that are built on-site. Low running costs (lesser fuel, fewer staff) and increased efficiency. Better control/flexibility: Generating less electricity when demand is down and are particularly useful for remote lo- cations - have variable power generation requirements. Safety features: Don’t need a power supply and can handle accidents without the assistance of a person or a computer. SMRs and SDGs: SMRs can play a key role in the clean energy transition, while also helping countries achieve SDG 7 (universal access to energy). Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 99 Challenges Lack of development: SMR industry is yet to realise a fully developed opera- tional fabrication facility for large-scale serial manufacturing of SMR compo- nents. Economic benefits depend on the large- scale production of SMRs. A large number of technologies: For de- ployment of the SMRs at the same time, could not only create regulatory chal- lenges for the nuclear industry but also take away some degree of cost optimi- sation. Mobilising finance: For technology de- velopment, licensing and construction of prototype plants. Way ahead Standardisation of designs of compo- nents and modules, strategic partner- ships, and harmonisation of regulatory and licensing processes will facilitate the adoption of SMRs at a large scale. The existing safety assessment method- ology should be updated. Availability of low-cost finance, inclu- sion in green taxonomy and utilisation of innovative financing instruments such as green bonds, etc. Availability of required skilled person- nel across the value chain of engineer- ing, design, testing, inspection, construc- tion, etc. Conclusion: • SMR may complement large-size reactors to in- crease the nuclear share in the energy mix and achieve Net Zero Emissions goals. • The respective governments have to play a major role in consensus building towards nuclear energy by engaging relevant stakeholders.

Land reclamation Meaning It is the process of creating new land from oceans, seas, riverbeds or lake beds. Methods Infilling (filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock/cement/clay/dirt until the desired height is reached), draining of sub- merged wetlands, land dredging (removal of sediments and debris from the bottom of a body of water), etc. Objectives • A solution for many countries is to con- trol flooding and make more space for agriculture and coastal industries, bal- ancing economy and ecology. • Cities are already spending to include “future-ready” reclamation techniques - including seawalls and breakwaters - in ongoing reclamation projects and re- inforcing and elevating existing coastal defences. Example The Netherlands, where around one-third of the country is below sea level, must be artificially drained to keep out the North Sea. Now a glob- a l -sc a l e p heno me - non • With the increased economic impor- tance of coastal zones, coastal land reclamation has become a global phe- nomenon despite considerable cost and engineering challenges. • 106 cities around the world had alto- gether created around 2,530 square km of coastal land (~90% of that land was created in East Asia), an area roughly the size of Luxembourg. China leads the way • From 2000 to 2020, Shanghai alone added around 350 square km, with Sin- gapore and Incheon (South Korea), also raising vast new areas. • The “eco-city” projects in cities like Tianjin and Tangshan near Beijing in- clude environmentally friendly features like rehabilitated wetlands, artificial reefs, and restored mangrove forests that act as a buffer from ocean storms. • This means, the reclamation projects today are getting intertwined with the emerging sustainability paradigm. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 100 Challenges: • Most coastal land expansions happened in low-lying ar- eas, with more than 70% of new land ‘at high risk’ of storm surges and flooding due to rising sea levels linked to climate change. • The environmental cost of land reclamation projects can be significant. • Projects have destroyed coastal land like marsh- es, swamps and mangrove forests. • Using sand obtained from the marine and river en- vironment can mean the destruction of habitats and spawning grounds of organisms. As sea levels rise, is land reclamation still a good idea? While land reclamation has provided benefits in the past, the changing climate and rising sea levels introduce new challenges and risks. For example, the Maldives, a nation that heavily relied on land reclamation, now faces the threat of losing large portions of its reclaimed land due to rising sea levels, making it an unsuitable long-term solution. It is crucial to assess the long-term sustainability, environ- mental impact, and cost-effectiveness of land reclamation projects in the context of a changing climate. Way ahead: • Use alternative fill like excavated rock and soil from local construction projects, or reclaimed concrete, asphalt, bricks and other rubble. • Several countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam) have already banned the export of sand for land reclamation. Conclusion: Seas are not empty spaces as there are vibrant human and non-human communities whose lives are dependent on the health of the sea. Therefore, they need to be protected. 32.GLOBAL LAND OUTLOOK REPORT Context: According to the 2nd edition of the Global Land Outlook (GLO) report, humans have breached four out of nine plan- etary boundaries. GLO: • It is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desert- ification’s (UNCCD) flagship publication, whose 1st edition was launched in 2017 at the UNCCD COP13 (China). • It underscores land system challenges, showcases transformative policies and practices, and points to cost-effective pathways to scale up sustainable land and water management. Highlights of the report: Importance of Land: It is the operative link between biodi- versity loss and climate change, which means restoring land is crucial to solving interconnected crises. What are planetary boundaries? • The environmental thresholds that establish a “safe operating space for humanity” are known as plane- tary boundaries. • The nine planetary boundaries are: \t Biodiversity loss \t Land-use change \t Climate change \t Nitrogen and phosphorus (geochemical) cy- cles \t Freshwater use \t Ocean acidification \t Chemical pollution \t Atmospheric loading \t Ozone depletion Threats: • Humans have already altered more than 70% of the earth’s land area from its natural state. • Of the 9 planetary boundaries, climate change, bio- diversity loss, land-use change, and geochemical cy- cles have already been exceeded. Causes: • Worldwide, food systems (including agriculture) are responsible for 80% of deforestation and 70% of freshwater use and are the single greatest cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss. • Land degradation, desertification and drought pose a great risk to global food security as well. \t Land degradation is the reduction or loss of biological and economic productivity of land and its constituents: soil, water, and biodiversity. Impact: This has contributed significantly to global warming and environmental degradation → leading to a rise in poverty, hunger, inequality, zoonotic disease transmission, etc. Recommendations: Effective land restoration: • The report defines land restoration as a continuum of activities that \t Avoid (By eliminating practices that degrade the environment, ranging from land and ecosystem conversion to socio-economic in- equalities) \t Reduce (By adopting sustainable land and water management practices) and Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 101 \t Reverse (By revitalising soil, watersheds, and other elements of natural ecosystems) land degradation with the explicit objective of meeting human needs and improving ecology. • The global annual cost of land restoration is expect- ed at ~$300 billion by 2030. • Each dollar invested is estimated to return between $7 and $30 in economic benefits, moving towards an equitable and sustainable future. Achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN): LDN is a state whereby the quantity and quality of land re- sources required to maintain ecosystem functions and ser- vices and improve food security are steady or growing. Integrated land use planning: • Identifying the best combination of land uses → sustainably meeting the needs of the stakeholders as well as preserving the land resources. • A cost-effective approach is to identify landscapes while maximising benefits, such as in global resto- ration hotspots. Regenerative agricultural practices: Like terrace farming and rainwater harvesting → help restore land, increase crop yields, reduce GHG emissions, sequester atmospheric carbon, and create meaningful livelihoods. Inclusive and responsible governance: It is crucial to facilitate the shift to sustainable land use and management practices. Initiatives of Land Restoration Global India The Bonn Challenge (2011) is a global effort to restore 350 million hectares of the world’s degraded and defor- ested lands by 2030. Currently, 97.85 million hectares (mha) of land - an area 2.5 times the size of In- dia’s largest state Rajasthan, has already been degraded. UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration: The Decade (2021-2030) is being cham- pioned by the UNEP and FAO. In 2019, India raised its land restoration target (under the Bonn Challenge) from 21 million hectares to 26 million hectares by 2030. The G20 Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conserva- tion of Terrestrial Habitats: Launched in 2020, it aims to prevent, halt and reverse land degradation and re- duce degraded land by 50% by 2040. Now, MGNREGS is to fund work to reverse land degra- dation. Some best practices in India: • Holiyas: These are water management systems in Gu- jarat, which store rainwater below the land surface. The groundwater can be accessed and distributed us- ing solar pumps when there is scarcity. • Plantopathy: It is a unique nature-based solution that can limit the impact of plant diseases on yields with- out pesticides or chemicals. • Zero budget natural farming (ZBNF): It combines tra- ditional and emerging practices to reduce costs (i.e., zero budget) while boosting yields and overall farm health by using organic inputs sourced locally (i.e., natural farming). Conclusion: Land restoration is a shared responsibility. Hence, govern- ments, scientists, civil society, and private sector players need to work together to set land and ecosystem restoration goals that transform land-use systems.

Wildlife translocation: • It is the intentional movement of animals for conser- vation purposes - a technique to mitigate the loss and depletion of endangered species. • It requires planning, a detailed analysis of the habitat, and consideration of the long-term prospects for the survival of the released animals. • The ecological, economic, and societal consequences of the release are also taken into account. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 102 Advantages: • An important conservation tool for restoring threat- ened and endangered wildlife populations. • To meet the goal of re-establishing populations in formerly occupied areas. • Population balancing - shifting from high/overpopu- lation to low population regions. Risks associated: • Legal and policy issues • Disease concerns • Stress to the animal: Translocation, unlike dispersal, is not due to natural or deliberate behaviour. • Homing: It refers to an animal’s capacity to travel back to its original catch site after translocation. The success/failure of translocating wildlife depends on - • Which species is being shifted; • Whether it can survive in its new habitat and breed successfully; • The amount of time and resources being allocated to the process. • Anthropogenic angle/coexistence with people. The failure of a translocation programme can lead to - • Distrust between stakeholders; • The loss of resources and • Even the extinction or extirpation of entire popula- tions or species. Case of India – • The ongoing Project Cheetah of the GoI: It has suf- fered setbacks recently. Two cheetahs (one from South Africa and the other from Namibian) brought to MP’s Kuno National Park from South Africa died of cardiac and renal failure. • The Gaur Relocation in India (2011): The project saw the first reversal of local extinction in the Band- havgarh Tiger Reserve (MP), with 19 Gaurs coming here from Kanha Tiger Reserves (MP). Need of the hour - Importance to be given to anthropogen- ic angle: • The IUCN Global Re-Introduction Perspective Series identifies the relationship between the inclusion of human dimension objectives in wildlife transloca- tion efforts and programme outcomes. • Of the six key strategies identified for including hu- man dimension objectives, education was the most common, followed by \t Engaging locals, \t Providing economic benefits, \t Increasing social tolerance, \t Enforcing regulations and \t Supplying cultural benefits. The success story of including an anthropogenic angle: Four cheetahs were translocated from South Africa to Ma- lawi in 2017 is a major conservation success for a species that is considered vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Global efforts - ICTC: • International Conservation Translocation Confer- ence (ICTC) is a premier conservation translocation science event, linked to the IUCN. • This helps the government/policymakers to learn from global experts how to best plan and imple- ment conservation translocations. Conclusion: The problem with India’s Project Cheetahs is that the species is being translocated from entirely different countries and ecosystems. Therefore, proper scientific study must be con- ducted before executing the project.

What is Chir Pine Belt? It refers to an area characterized by the dominance of chir pine trees (Pinus roxburghii). It is found primarily in the state of Uttarakhand. The high presence of chir pine trees in this belt also contributes to the susceptibility to forest fires in the area. About the chir pine: It is a species of pine tree that is native to the Himalayan region. It is a fast-growing evergreen tree and forms dense forests in the sub-tropical and temperate regions of Uttara- khand. Factors contributing to forest fire challenges in the Chir Pine Belt of Uttarakhand: Factors Description High forest density Uttarakhand accounts for 1.6 per cent of India’s total geographical area. But in terms of forest cover, the state accounts for 45 per cent, in contrast to national for- est cover of just 21.67 per cent. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 103 High presence of pine trees Chir pine dominates the forest composi- tion in the region. Pine trees are rich in organic polymers, making them vulnera- ble to forest fires. Dry biomass Pine needles and other plant-based litter create fuel for fires. Dry biomass increas- es the risk of fire outbreaks. V u l n er a b i l - ity of nar- r o w -le a v e d species The forest ecosystem in the region is dominated by narrow-leaved species like Pinus, Picea, and Abies. These species are susceptible to fires when exposed to low temperatures and humidity. Human-made fires Timber smugglers often set intentional fires to divert attention and facilitate il- legal activities. Developmental activities and unchecked land-use patterns con- tribute to human-induced fire hazards. Climate condi- tions Uttarakhand experiences low rainfall and high temperatures. The ample availabil- ity of dry biomass during the summer season increases fire risks. Also, Strong winds contribute to the rapid spread of fires across the forests. Measures to Combat Forest Fires in the Chir Pine Belt of Uttarakhand: Measures Description Plantation of suitable broad-leaved species Introduce species like oak and rhododendron with lower fire susceptibility. Diversify the for- est composition and reduce the overall fire risk. Construction of watch towers for early detec- tion Install watch towers to detect forest fires at an early stage. Facilitate prompt response and intervention to control fire inci- dents. Deployment of fire watchers Assign personnel as fire watch- ers in vulnerable areas. Regular surveillance to detect and re- port fires promptly. Creation and mainte- nance of fire lines Clear vegetation creates fire lines and fire breaks as barriers. Use of remote sensing technology and satel- lite data Utilize technology to detect active forest fires from space. Enable early identification and timely response to fire incidents. Exclusive recruitment of forest fire-fighting staff Employ trained personnel equipped with modern firefight- ing technologies. Ensure spe- cialized teams are available for fire suppression. Joint Forest Manage- ment (JFM), Van pan- chayats, and communi- cation Promote community involve- ment and cooperation in for- est management. Utilize elec- tronic, social media, radio, and television for awareness. Raise awareness and encourage re- sponsible forest practices. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has sug- gested measures for fire control in Himalayan regions such as Early detection and reporting; Fireline creation; Commu- nity involvement; Training and capacity building; Use of tech- nology and Firefighting teams. A few measures taken are: National Policy on Forest Fire (finalized by the government); National Plan for forest fire management; National Forest Fire Danger Rating System; Firefighting tools and machinery (e.g. Fire Beaters, Pulaskis Tools, Forest Fire Showel, etc.); Forest Fire Prevention & Management Scheme (FFPMS, 2017) Conclusion: Addressing and mitigating forest fires in the Himalayan re- gion requires a comprehensive approach that includes ear- ly detection, community involvement, capacity building, technology utilization, and effective collaboration between various stakeholders. By implementing these measures, the risk and impact of forest fires can be significantly reduced, protecting the invaluable biodiversity and ecological balance of the region. Mains Link Q.

Highlights of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) study: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 104 • The AP region accounts for more than half of the world’s GHGs. • Over the past 60 years, temperatures in the AP re- gion have increased faster than the global mean. • Extreme, unpredictable weather events and natu- ral hazards (like Tropical cyclones, heatwaves, floods and droughts) have become more frequent and in- tense. Impact: • Damaging people’s health, immense loss of life and displacement. • Food systems here are being disrupted, economies damaged and societies undermined. • Leading cause of poverty and inequality across the region by disproportionately burdening poor and marginalised groups. Most vulnerable: China, India, Japan, Indonesia, the Repub- lic of Korea and the Russian Federation are projected to suf- fer the greatest losses under the worst-case climate scenario. Challenges: • The AP region is one of the most rapidly developing regions of the world, with a significant proportion of the global population. • The region is also home to most of the world’s low-lying cities and vulnerable small island states. • Overlapping crises of climate change and climate-in- duced disasters are increasingly threatening devel- opment in AP - \t Undermining hard-won development gains. \t Imperils Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). • Lack of necessary data as well as means to support adaptation and mitigation efforts. • The current financing is insufficient to meet the re- gion’s requirements for investment in climate action or to contain global warming at 1.5°C. Steps needed: The emissions gap in three key sectors - energy, transport, and international trade and investment - needs to be closed. 1. Energy: • A rapid increase in renewable energy by restructur- ing national energy systems, new technical capaci- ties, etc. • The need for cross-border electricity grids to in- crease the share of renewable energy. • Energy efficiency codes must be aligned with net-ze- ro goals to reduce carbon footprint in the building sector. • Climate-proofing energy systems. 2. The transport sector: Should be shifted to a low-carbon pathway by reducing transport distance through integrated land use, planning, shifting to sustainable transport modes, as well as improving vehicle and fuel efficiency. 3. International trade: • Integrate climate considerations into regional trade agreements. • Trade must be climate-smart. • The private sector must be encouraged to work towards a low-carbon pathway and sustainability should be ingrained into business operations.

LINKAGES BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND SPREAD OF EXTREMISM. 36. MAOIST CHALLENGE: NEEDS POLITICAL UNDERSTANDING, NOT SECURITIZATION Context: The efficacy of the Maoist movement needs to be gauged in terms of their declining social base, not on the basis of how Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 105 many violent incidents occur. Maoist movement in India Cu rr en t approach Expected out- come Issues Use of Force The use of force (includ- ing special- ly -t r aine d forces such as the Grey- hounds) has led to a de- cline in Mao- ist presence and the use of more force will end its remaining in- fluence. The use of more force only helped the Maoists recruit from the local tribal popula- tion. The Maoist movement moved from the leadership of outsid- ers (mostly from Telangana) to that of local tribals. Such internal changes led to local support for the move- ment from tribals in Chhattis- garh and Jharkhand. Develop- ment Welfare and development as part of the “strategy” to calm down and make the Maoists irrel- evant. The D Bandyopadhyay Com- mittee (2006) stated that land alienation and poverty among STs and Dalits, and lack of ac- cess to basic forest resources contributed to the growth of Naxalism. The state’s model of develop- ment has resulted in the dis- placement of tribals → lead- ing to the peaceful Pathalgarhi movement in Jharkhand What led to the failure of the above approaches: • Declining Maoist presence/violence could well be a po- litical strategy of the Maoists to go silent/underground and wait for lapses on the part of the security forces. • Eminent Domain doctrine, argues that all resources be- long to the nation and can be extracted in the “national interest”. • Development is seen as a zero-sum game by either side leads. • A single conception of development to address the var- ious, occasionally incompatible demands of oppressed groups. • The securitisation paradigm is also insufficient to com- prehend social exclusion. Conclusion: • Both Ambedkar and Gandhi were of the view that social exclusion and caste cannot be addressed through vio- lence. • To end the social exclusion of tribals there is the need to understand that development is a multi-faceted pro- cess.

(UPSC 2015) 37.INSURGENCY IN MANIPUR Context: Amid fresh violence in Manipur, the Kuki National Organisa- tion (KNO) has countered the claims of the Manipur CM that 40 insurgents had been killed by security forces. How did violent clashes start? • Violence erupted in the Kuki-dominated Churachand- pur district, where members of the Kuki tribe were pro- testing against the Meitei community’s demands to be designated as a “Scheduled Tribe”. • The tribes believe granting ST status to the Meiteis would be an infringement of their rights as they claim to be the marginalised part of the population. History of conflict in Manipur: Manipur has been in the cross-currents of India’s oldest insurgent movement - The Naga national movement in the 1950s. The Valley insurgent groups: • In 1964, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was formed, demanding secession from India. • Subsequently, numerous Meitei insurgent groups (PREPAK, PLA) came into being, which received arms and training from China. • These groups operated with a dual purpose - indepen- dence from India, and warding off Naga insurgent groups. The Kuki-Zomi insurgent groups: • It started as a defence against aggression by other groups, but quickly turned to a call for Kukiland - an imagined country spreading across the Kuki-Zomi inhab- ited areas of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. • Over time, this was diluted to simply a call for a sepa- rate state. Government reaction: www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 106 • The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) 1958 was enacted and extended to the entire state. • In the 1980s, Manipur was declared a disturbed area. • A tripartite Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement between the Centre, the state and the Kuki-Zomi groups was signed in 2008. • As the law-and-order situation gradually improved, AFS- PA has been repealed in several areas. • However, the Valley insurgent groups (like the UNLF, which is considered the mother of all Meitei insurgent groups) have never entered an agreement with the Cen- tre. Insurgent groups in society and politics: • The insurgent groups are intricately woven into daily life in Manipur. \t They conduct strikes, and impose moral codes such as a ban on Hindi movies and music, etc. \t The groups also levy ‘taxes’ on the public. • The groups are most visible today in the political life of the state. Candidates, cutting across party lines, stand for elections with insurgent backing, and the groups dictate to the voters who should win.

(UPSC 2017) INTERNAL SECURITY 38. 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF POKHRAN-II Context: On May 11, 1998, codenamed Operation Shakti (literally, “strength”)/Pokhran-II, India conducted three nuclear bomb test explosions at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range. Timeline of Operation Shakti/Pokhran-II: Foundation of India’s nuclear programme laid by physicist Homi J Bhaba: • Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR): India’s first research institution dedicated to the study of nucle- ar physics opened (1945) in Bombay, after Bhaba’s suc- cessful lobbying. • Department of Atomic Energy (DAE): Founded in 1954 with Bhabha as director. The threat of China and Pakistan: • The 1962 Sino-Indian War and China’s subsequent nu- clear bomb test at Lop Nor in 1964. • The 1965 India-Pakistan war, with China openly sup- porting Pakistan. • Therefore, India was surrounded by two unfriendly na- tions and needed to take steps towards building self-suf- ficiency. The “discriminatory” NPT: • By the 1960s, discourse around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation as the Cold War arms race pushed the US and the USSR to great extremes. • In 1968, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) came into existence, defining nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 - the US, Russia (formerly USSR), the UK, France and China. • This disallows any other state from acquiring nuclear weapons. • The government of India refused to accede to the terms of the treaty because it failed to address India’s con- cerns. Pokhran-I/Operation Smiling Buddha: • By the 1970s, Vikram Sarabhai (Bhaba’s successor at the DAE) had worked to significantly broaden India’s nuclear technology. • The Indira Gandhi government showed political will and on May 18, 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test at the Pokhran test site. • This test was conceptualised as a “peaceful nuclear ex- plosion” with “few military implications”. International sanctions on India post-Pokhran-I: Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 107 • The world was not willing to buy India’s version of the motive behind Pokhran-I and countries like the US and Canada imposed significant sanctions. • These sanctions (majorly on tech transfer) would be a major setback for India’s nuclear journey and majorly decelerate its progress. The period between the two tests: • Domestic political instability: The Emergency of 1975 and PM Morarji Desai’s opposition to nuclear weapons brought the programme to a grinding halt. • 1980s: Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was made in charge of In- dia’s missile programme (1983) and India exponentially increased its plutonium stockpiles. • 1990S: • With the fall of the USSR in 1991, India lost one of its biggest military allies. • The US continued to provide military aid to Pakistan. • Discussions regarding a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) were also underway in the UN (it would be finalised in 1996, but India did not sign it). Pokhran-II - Projecting India’s strength: • In 1995, permission for carrying out a nuclear test was granted. However, logistical and political reasons pushed back the tests further. • In 1998, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government showed political will and successfully conducted Operation Shakti. • Unlike the 1974 test, the Indian Government declared itself as a state possessing nuclear weapons following Pokhran-II. • Though the test invited sanctions from some countries (like the US), the condemnation was far less than in 1974. • The test helped India enter the highly guarded club of countries with the capability to deploy nuclear weap- ons, helping it to cement its status as a dominant na- tion-state. India’s nuclear doctrine (presented in 1999) since Pokhran- II: • It highlighted a credible minimum deterrence (CMD) and a no-first-use (NFU) policy, while concur- rently supporting non-proliferation and universal disarmament. • The sole purpose of India’s nuclear deterrence is to deter adversaries’ use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. • The policy changed India’s image and the US (once an adversary of India’s nuclear programme) signed a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008, acknowledging India as a responsible nuclear player. Way ahead: • India needs actions at two levels for sustainable na- tional security: \t To address immediate security threats by intelligently building sufficient and resilient retaliatory capability to signal credible de- terrence. \t To make long-term innovative diplomatic investments towards the creation of a glob- al environment conducive to peace and uni- versal nuclear disarmament. • Simultaneously, India can leverage the economic, political and cultural appeal to showcase the advan- tages of its philosophy of nuclear deterrence.

Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 115 About Albert Einstein discovered the theory of general relativity in 1915, including the existence of gravitational waves, but he was skeptical. The debate continued for decades until Feynman (in 1957) proposed a simple thought experiment that demonstrated how gravitational waves could transfer energy, resolving the con- fusion.

SAMARTH RAMDAS AND CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ Context: The NCP has demanded an “unconditional apology” from a religious leader (Jaggi Vasudev) for making the claim that Saint Samarth Ramdas was Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shiva- ji’s guru. Who was Samarth Ramdas/Sant Ramdas? • Samarth Ramdas (1608 - 1681) was a Hindu saint, phi- losopher, poet, writer and spiritual master. • A devotee of Lord Ram and Hanuman, he has influenced Hindu nationalist thinkers across the years like Lokman- ya Tilak, KB Hedgewar and VD Savarkar. • His Maruti Stotra is still commonly recited by school chil- dren as well as wrestlers akharas across Maharashtra. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj • Shivaji Bhonsale I (1630-1680), popularly known as Ch- hatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was a Maratha ruler from the Bhonsle clan. • From the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur, Shiva- ji carved out his own independent kingdom, laying the foundation of the Maratha Empire. • At Raigad Fort in 1674, he was formally crowned Chha- trapati (Emperor) of his empire. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 132 What do historians say? • Shivaji Maharaj and Samarath Ramdas were contempo- raries. • Shivaji Maharaj gave donations to temples of Samarth Ramdas as well as other people and religions. • There is no historical evidence to verify the fact that Samarth Ramdas was the guru of Chhatrapati Shivaji. • This may be done for the maintenance of Brahmanical supremacy. 20. GOPAL KRISHNA GOKHALE URBANIZATION, THEIR PROBLEMS AND THEIR REMEDIES 21.DIGITAL TWINS Context: India may soon join the ranks of cities and countries such as Singapore, Yingtan in China, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, etc. that have built digital twins to enhance their efficiency, coordi- nation and governance. About digital twins: It is a three-dimensional (3D) virtual representation of a city or system that provides real-time insights into the per- formance, operation, or profitability of a city. For example, let’s say a city government wants to develop a new trans- port system. By creating a digital twin of the city, they can simulate the transport system and see how it will function in real-world conditions. Purpose To improve efficiency, coordination, and governance of cities. E.g., digital twins can be used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion, improve the efficiency of pub- lic transportation systems, manage energy consumption, monitor air and water quali- ty, and identify areas that are vulnerable to natural disasters. Benefits Enables better planning of infrastructure at lower costs. Can support climate-smart cities or green infrastructure. Can improve healthcare, education, agriculture, and other areas Challenges Requires large amounts of data collection and processing. Can be costly and time-con- suming to develop. Requires expertise in data analysis and 3D modelling Future po- tential Could revolutionize the way we plan and manage cities. Could improve the quality of life for urban residents. This could lead to more sustainable and efficient use of re- sources IMPORTANT GEOPHYSICAL PHE- NOMENA/GEOGRAPHY 22.

PALGHAT GAP 25.NORTHERN LIGHTS IN INDIA 26.INDIA IS HEATING UP SLOWER THAN THE WORLD AVERAGE A.HEAT INDEX Context: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has announced plans to launch a composite index next year to measure the impact of heat on India’s population. About Heat Index: Topic Information www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 134 What is the heat index? The heat index is the combination of air temperature and relative humidity, it is the measure of how hot it really feels when rela- tive humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature. Aim of the new index To quantify the impact of heat on its popu- lation and generate impact-based heatwave alerts for specific locations. P ar am e - ters to be used Temperature, humidity, wind, and duration of exposure Signif i - cance The analysis will help generate heat hazard scores, which will be used as thresholds to issue impact-based heatwave alerts for spe- cific locations. H ea t Waves in India According to IMD data, there was a 24% in- crease in the number of heat waves during 2010-2019 compared to 2000-2009. Be- tween 2000 and 2019, the mortality rate for tropical cyclones decreased by 94% where- as it increased by 62% for heat waves. Heat waves is not notified as a natural disaster at the national level in the country. Impact of heat waves Heat waves cause cramps, exhaustion, stress, heat stroke and very severe heat waves even lead to death. The elderly, chil- dren, and people with heart and respiratory problems, kidney diseases and psychiatric disorders are particularly affected. Extreme periods of high temperatures can lead to a significant reduction in crop yields and cause reproductive failure in many crops. About IMD: The India Meteorological Department (found- ed: 1875; HQ: New Delhi; Ministry of Earth Science) is the principal agency responsible for meteorological observa- tions, weather forecasting and seismology in India GS PAPER 2 INDIAN CONSTITUTION 1.ARTICLE 299 OF THE CONSTITUTION Context: The recent ruling by the Supreme Court states that when the government enters into a contract under the President’s name, it cannot claim immunity from the legal provisions of that contract under Article 299 of the Constitution. About the case: The case involved Glock Asia-Pacific Limited, a pistol man- ufacturing company, and the Centre (government). Glock had a contract with the Ministry of Home Affairs to supply pistols, but a dispute arose when the government invoked a performance bank guarantee. Glock invoked arbitra- tion, but the government challenged the appointment of the arbitrator based on a tender condition. The Supreme Court decided in favour of Glock, stating that the arbitration clause allowing a government officer as an arbitrator conflicted with the law. The court appointed a retired Supreme Court judge as the arbitrator to resolve the dispute. Article 299 of the Constitution: It specifies the manner in which government contracts should be concluded and executed. The objective of this ar- ticle is to ensure that contracts made by agents acting on the government’s behalf adhere to a defined procedure to prevent unauthorized or illegitimate contracts that may de- plete public funds. Provision Explanation Contracts must be expressed to be made by President/ Governor All contracts made in the exercise of executive power must be clearly stated to be made by the President of India or the Governor of a State. Execution of con- tracts Contracts and assurances of proper- ty made in the exercise of executive power shall be executed on behalf of the President or Governor by persons authorized by them. Personal liability exemption Neither the President nor the Gov- ernor shall be personally liable for any contract or assurance made or executed in accordance with Article 299. Exemption for per- sons executing con- tracts Individuals executing contracts on behalf of the President or Governor shall also not be personally liable for those contracts. Compliance with statutory law Article 299 does not grant the gov- ernment immunity from the appli- cation of statutory laws when enter- ing into contracts. The government is still bound by applicable laws. LOCAL GOVERNMENT 2. QUOTA IN URBAN LOCAL BODIES Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 135 Context: The Haryana Cabinet has accepted the State Backward Classes Commission’s report on the proportion of reserva- tions for the Backward Classes Block-A category in urban lo- cal bodies. Recommendation of the commission: • The commission has recommended that every munici- pal body should have at least one councillor belonging to BC (A) if its population is not less than two per cent of the total population of the urban local body. • There are 78 backward classes in Haryana and 72 of them have been notified in the Block-A sub-category and six in the Block-B category. OBC reservation in local body polls: Informa- tion Details Supreme Court As per the directions of the Supreme Court, the reservation shall not exceed the aggre- gate of 50% of the total seats reserved Triple test formula In December 2021 the Supreme Court di- rected that reservation for OBCs in local bod- ies will not be permitted unless they fulfil the triple test ( laid down in the SC’s own 2010 decision) Other states with OBC reserva- tion Madhya Pradesh; 27% OBC reservations in lo- cal body elections in Maharashtra; 33% quo- ta for OBCs in ULB polls in Karnataka Reser- vation provisions for SC/ST Provided in the 73rd & 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.

Other Commis- sions Kalelkar Commission identified backward classes other than SCs and STs in 1953. Man- dal Commission (1980) estimated the OBC population at 52% and recommended in- creasing existing quotas to 49.5%. JUDICIARY 3. HATE SPEECH Context: The Supreme Court of India has directed all states to regis- ter FIRs (First Information Reports) against hate speech inci- dents and proceed against the offenders without waiting for someone to lodge a complaint. About Hate Speech: Topic Information Definition An incitement to hatred primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, etc. Forms Any form of expression including words, images, cartoons, objects, gestures, and symbols, can be disseminated of- fline or online. Current Status in India Hate speech has not been defined in any law in India. However, IPC, 1860 sec- tions like 153A, 153B, 298, etc. deal with speech or words that could create mis- chief or cause imputations to national integration. Proposed Legis- lation The Law Commission of India has pro- posed two new sections, Section 153C, and Section 505A in IPC to criminalize hate speech specifically. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 136 Rise in Cases According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there has been a huge increase in cases registered to promote hate speech and foster animosity in society. As there were only 323 cases registered in 2014, it had increased to 1,804 cases in 2020. Punishment The punishment for hate speech is not defined in Indian law. However, the Supreme Court has stated that hate speech statutes aim to prevent preju- dice and ensure equality. Hate Speech Vs Blasphemy Hate speech laws aim to prevent prej- udice and ensure equality, while blas- phemy laws prohibit criticism of reli- gion, which is incompatible with the principles of democratic societies. Sec- tion 295(A) of the IPC punishes any speech, writings, or signs that insult cit- izens’ religion or religious beliefs with a fine and imprisonment for up to three years. 4. USE OF REGIONAL LANGUAGE IN COURTS Context: Union Law Minister has stated that regional languages should be used in courts in every state. About the Languages to be Used in Courts in India: Courts Arti cl e 348(1)(a) Unless Parliament by law provides other- wise, all proceedings before the Supreme Court and in every High Court shall be con- ducted in English. Arti cl e 348(2) The Governor of a state may, with the previ- ous consent of the President, authorise the use of Hindi or any other language used for any official purpose, in proceedings in the High Court except for any final judgement, decree or order (which has to be in English) E.g., the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajas- than and Madhya Pradesh have already au- thorised the use of Hindi Offi ci a l Languages Act 1963 It empowers the Governor of a state to, with the previous consent of the President, au- thorise the use of Hindi/the official language of the state, in addition to English, for the purpose of any judgement, decree or order passed by the High Court of that state. How- ever, the judgement should follow an English translation. Subor - dina t e C our ts (Dis trict Co u rt s, etc.) Regional language determined by the state government 5. POWER TO DIRECT CHANGES IN STS LIST Context: The CJI questioned why an old Constitution Bench judgment which states that no court or State has the power to add/ subtract/modify the Scheduled Tribes List - was not shown to the Manipur HC. Background: Violent clashes followed after a Single Judge Bench of the Manipur HC directed that the State government shall consid- er the case for the inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei communi- ty (in Manipur) in the ST list, expeditiously. Article 342 of the Indian Constitution: • Clause (1): The President may, with respect to any State (after consultation with the Governor) or UT, by public notification, specify the tribes deemed to be ST in rela- tion to that state or UT. • Clause (2): The Parliament may by law include or exclude from the list of ST specified in the above notification. • The above Article also provides for listing of STs State/UT wise and not on an all-India basis. The Maharashtra versus Milind (2000) case: • A notification issued under Article 342 (1), specifying STs, can be amended only by law to be made by Parliament. • In other words, inclusion/exclusion from the list of STs issued under Article 342 (1) can be made only by Parliament by law and by no other authority.

ANURADHA BHASIN’S CASE – INTERNET SHUTDOWN Context: The Supreme Court issued notice-seeking compliance with the judgment of the Apex Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India and Ors, wherein it had laid down guidelines with respect to the internet shutdown. Background: The main petition was filed by Anuradha Bhasin, which chal- lenged the curbs on the internet, media, and other prohibi- tions imposed in the Kashmir region following the abroga- tion of the special status of J&K. Constitutional Articles Related to internet shutdown: • Freedom of speech and expression and also freedom of trade and commerce through the medium of the inter- net are constitutionally protected rights under Articles 19(1)(a) and Articles 19(1)(g). • Restriction on fundamental rights should be in accor- dance with the mandate under Articles 19(2) and (6) and in consonance with the test of proportionality. • The test of proportionality is a legal principle used to determine whether a governmental action is a justified infringement on an individual’s fundamen- tal rights or not. Court had passed the following directions in the case: An order suspending internet services indefinitely is imper- missible under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Ser- vices (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules, 2017. 1. Suspension can be utilized for a temporary duration only. 2. Any order suspending internet issued under the Sus- pension Rules must adhere to the principle of proportion- ality and must not extend beyond the necessary duration 3. Any order suspending the internet under the Sus- pension Rules is subject to judicial review. 7.FREEDOM TO PROTEST Context: The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently struck down a gov- ernment order that aimed to regulate public meetings, pro- cessions, and assemblies on roads, highways, and streets. What was the issue? The Andhra Pradesh government contended that its action was necessary to regulate these activities in light of recent accidents caused by processions on roads. However, the Andhra High Court struck down the government order, stat- ing that the tradition of public meetings and assemblies holds historical, cultural, and political significance in the country. What did Andhra HC say: Topic Summary About Police Act 1861 The court analyzed relevant sections of the Police Act, 1861, and concluded that they give authorities the power to regu- late (e.g., in case of “road blockage”), but not completely restrict, assemblies and processions on public roads. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 138 Fundamental Rights The right to assemble, to protest peace- fully, and to express one’s opinion freely is an important freedom which cannot be taken away. Constitutional Provision Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression. Article 19(1)(b) protects the right to assemble peaceably and with- out arms. Import ance of freedom of speech and democracy Freedom of speech is considered the “bulwark” of democracy and is regarded as the first in the hierarchy of liberties. It plays a crucial role in safeguarding dem- ocratic principles and ensuring open dia- logue and expression of ideas. SC guidelines The Supreme Court, in the case of Maz- door Kisan Shakti Sangathan vs Union of India, laid down guidelines for regulating protests and demonstrations. These guidelines include regulating the intended number of participants, pre- scribing minimum distances, imposing restrictions on certain routes, and disal- lowing the carrying of weapons. Protest vs Strike Protests are broader expressions of dis- sent or objection by individuals or groups on various issues. Strikes, on the other hand, specifically refer to organized work stoppages by employees seeking im- proved labour conditions. Right to pro- test vs right to strike In India, the right to protest is a funda- mental right under Article 19 of the Con- stitution. However, the right to strike is not a fundamental right but a legal right, protected by specific labour laws and reg- ulations. 8. ‘FORUM SHOPPING’ Context: Recently, CJI Chandrachud has condemned ‘forum shop- ping’. Forum shopping refers to the practice of litigants or lawyers deliberately selecting a particular judge or court where they believe the judgment will be more favourable to their case. This practice involves choosing a court that is likely to pro- vide the most favourable outcome, rather than following the standard legal process. Issues with Forum Shopping: • It circumvents the normal course of justice and can lead to an imbalance in the workload of courts. • The Supreme Court has condemned this practice. It has no sanction in law and must be discouraged. • Ethical issues: Unfair advantage; Manipulation of the le- gal system Recourse available with courts in case of ‘forum Shopping’: • Courts may exercise discretionary powers and refuse jurisdiction over a matter if another court or forum is more suitable. This ensures that cases are allocated to the appropriate bench and promotes fairness and jus- tice. • Courts can impose fines on litigants SC judgements on ‘Forum Shopping’: • SC in 1998 (Chetak Construction Ltd. vs. Om Prakash): “A litigant cannot be permitted choice of the forum,” and that every attempt at forum shopping “must be crushed with a heavy hand.” • SC (2017) (‘Union of India & Ors. vs. Cipla Ltd.’): SC laid down a “functional test” to be adopted for forum shopping. • SC (2022) (Vijay Kumar Ghai vs. State of W.B.): Su- preme Court termed forum shopping as a “disreputa- ble practise by the courts” that “has no sanction and paramountcy in law”. Related term: The practice of “bench hunting” refers to petitioners at- tempting to have their cases heard by a specific judge or court in order to obtain a favourable order. 9. INDEPENDENCE OF DISTRICT JUDICIARY Context: SC has held that the independence of the district judiciary is part of the basic structure of the Constitution and judicial in- dependence from the executive and the legislature requires the judiciary to have a say in matters of finances. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 139 SC observations: • The independence of the district judiciary is a vital part of the independent judicial system, which is, in turn, part of the basic structure of the Constitution. District judiciary was the backbone of the judicial sys- tem • ‘Doctrine of Inherent Powers of the Judiciary’: Judi- ciary must possess the inherent power to compel pay- ment of those sums of money which are reasonable and necessary to carry out its mandated responsibili- ties, and its powers and duties to administer justice. This doctrine is only the logical conclusion of separa- tion of powers and ensures that the independence of the judiciary is secured • Significance of District Judiciary: The district judiciary is, in most cases, also the court which is most acces- sible to the litigant. On a single day, the district ju- diciary handled nearly 11.3 lakh cases. Even during the period of the pandemic, the district judiciary was efficient and undertook its functions to ensure that justice was delivered in a timely manner. About the Basic Structure Doctrine: The Kesavananda Bharati judgment introduced the Basic Structure doctrine which limited Parliament’s power to make drastic amendments that may affect the core values enshrined in the Constitution like secularism and federal- ism. The verdict upheld the power of the Supreme Court to judicially review the laws of Parliament. STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND VAR- IOUS QUASI-JUDICIAL BODIES. 10. CANTONMENTS Context: The Indian Army is planning to merge civilian areas at can- tonments with municipal corporations and municipalities and designate them as military stations. What is the plan? Plan is to carve out the military areas in cantonments and convert them into “exclusive military stations” with the Army exercising “absolute control” over them. The civilian areas, in turn, will be merged with the local municipalities so as to provide them with the benefits of various govern- ment schemes. • The first cantonment to be renamed a military station is Yol in Himachal Pradesh • Not all cantonments will become military stations as some army and civilian pockets are intertwined. What are the issues with Cantonments? Cantonments have strict restrictions on construction, road use, and common area occupation, causing tension be- tween civilians and the military. Civilians face challenges in obtaining home loans and accessing government schemes. Even basic renovations require multiple permissions. About Cantonment: Information De fi n i - tion A proclaimed area under the Cantonments Act, 2006, governed and controlled by the cen- tral government of India to provide municipal services for civilians living in the area. Ca t eg o - ries Cantonment Boards are categorized into four categories based on population: Category I (>50,000), Category II (10,000-50,000), Catego- ry III (2,500-10,000), and Category IV (<2,500). Authority Cantonment Board is an authority under the Ministry of Defence. Composi- tion Consists of eight members: three ex-officio members, three nominated military members (garrison engineer, station commander, and senior executive medical officer), and one rep- resentative of the district magistrate. Services Provided Sanitation, primary education, street lighting, water supply, maintenance of roads, bridges, and public hospitals. Can t o n - ments vs Mi l i ta r y station Cantonments are civilian areas that are under the control of the military, and they usually have a civilian population living in them as well. Military stations, on the other hand, are purely military areas where only military per- sonnel and their families reside. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 140 IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF GOVER- NANCE, TRANSPARENCY AND AC- COUNTABILITY, E-GOVERNANCE; POLICY, LEGISLATIONS 11.

What are the new rules? • Chartered accountants, company secretaries, etc., will now be required to go through the Know Your Company (KYC) process before commencing work. • This implies accountants are now reporting entities if they are managing their clients’ money. Significance: The move aims at curbing fraudulent practices by which accountants allegedly help their clients to launder money. Need: The efforts are being taken ahead of the assessment of India under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) - a global regulator that assesses country compliance in tackling global money laundering and terror financing. What does the PMLA say about reporting entities? They are required to maintain a record of all transactions and furnish them to financial intelligence units (FIUs). 12.

PRICES OF DRUGS GOING OFF-PATENT Context: The government has introduced a formula to determine the pricing of medicines that are losing their patent exclusivity. Patents in India: A patent for drugs in India gives the patent holder exclusive rights to manufacture, use, sell, or import the patented drug in India for a specified period, typically 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Prices of Medicine in India: National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) (under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizer) has been estab- lished to fix/revise prices of medicines under the Drugs (Pric- es Control) Order (DPCO), 2013. The new formula: • For the off-patent price of a medicine (patented under the Patent Act, 1970): It will be capped at 50% of its original cost. After one-year ceiling price will be revised again based on market data. • For Generic version: When generic versions become available, the price will be determined based on the av- erage price of similar versions. • For Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC), where one compo- nent is going off patent, the ceiling price will be revised to 50% of the current ceiling price. • For innovative drugs not available in India: An expert committee will decide the price cap. Significance of the move: The move aims to streamline pric- ing and encourage competition in the market. Also, it will reduce the prices of the patented drugs which are a part of the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) Concerns: Civil society representatives have raised concerns about the potential for increased prices by generic manu- facturers.

Benefits for the USA: • Including India in NATO Plus, security arrangements would build upon the US and India’s close partner- ship to strengthen global security and deter the ag- gression of the CCP across the Indo-Pacific region NATO Plus, currently NATO Plus 5, is a security arrange- ment that brings together NATO and five aligned nations - Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, and South Korea - to boost global defence cooperation. 39.INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK (IPEF) Context: India fears that a proposal by the US under the “supply chains” pillar of the IPEF could violate WTO rules and reduce policy space. US proposal: All IPEF partner nations would be required to give advance notification of any changes to export regula- tions and tariffs. India’s concern: Notifications are usually done only after measures are taken and not before. India has therefore sought industry inputs to protect its interests. The IPEF: ● It is an economic initiative launched by the US Pres- ident Joe Biden on May 23, 2022. ● The framework launched with a total of 14 partici- pating founding member nations in the Indo-Pacific region with an open invitation for other countries to join. ● The IPEF members represent 40% of the global GDP and 28% of the world’s trade. ● Analysts have compared it to the Trans-Pacific Part- nership (TPP), which the US withdrew from in 2017. The IPEF has four pillars: ● Trade, supply chains, clean economy, and fair econ- omy. ● India has yet to take a call on whether to join the trade pillar, though it has joined the other three. A. IPEF MINISTERIAL MEETING GS PAPER 3 ECONOMY, BANKING, ENERGY, IN- FRASTRUCTURE 1. ROBERT LUCAS’ RATIONAL EXPECTATION THEORY Context: Nobel Laureate Robert E Lucas (1937 – May 15, 2023) was an economist known for developing the “rational expecta- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 153 tions” approach to macroeconomics. What is Macroeconomics? It studies the behaviour and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on analyzing aggregate economic vari- ables such as GDP (gross domestic product), inflation, unem- ployment, and overall economic growth. What is the “rational expectations” approach to macroeco- nomics? The “rational expectations” approach in macroeconomics suggests that people form expectations about the future based on available information and their understanding of the economy. For example, if people anticipate higher infla- tion due to a new government policy, they may adjust their behaviour accordingly. Significance of his work: Robert Lucas’s work on rational expectations in macroeco- nomics challenged traditional Keynesian economics and emphasized the importance of individuals forming expecta- tions based on available information. His research highlight- ed that predictable government policies may not have the desired impact on the economy. 2. AADHAAR-ENABLED PAYMENT SYSTEM (AEPS) Context: Scammers are reportedly using leaked biometric details (sil- icone thumbs), bypassing the need for OTPs, to siphon mon- ey from users’ bank accounts. About Aadhaar-enabled Payment System: • Aadhaar-enabled Payment Services (AePS) is a bank-led model, which allows online financial transactions at Point-of-Sale (PoS) and Micro ATMs through the business correspondent of any bank using Aadhaar authentication. • The model removes the need for OTPs, bank ac- count details, and other financial details. • It allows fund transfers using only the bank name, Aadhaar number, and fingerprint captured during Aadhaar enrolment, according to the National Pay- ments Corporation of India (NCPI). 3.ECL-BASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONING NORMS Context: Lenders have sought a one-year extension from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for implementation of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL)-based loan loss provisioning framework. What is loan loss provisioning? Loan loss provisioning refers to the practice of setting aside funds by banks to cover potential losses arising from loans that may default or become unrecoverable. Current Sys- tem Banks are required to make loan loss pro- visions based on an “incurred loss” ap- proach. Also, the Loan loss provisioning happens much later, leading to an increase in credit risk for banks. “Inc ur r e d Loss” model This model assumes that all loans will be repaid until evidence to the contrary is identified. Only at that point is the default- ed loan written down to a lower value. This leads to a delay in the recognition of defaults. The New Pro- posal RBI has proposed an expected loss (EL)- based approach for provisioning by banks in case of loan defaults. Banks are required to estimate expected credit losses based on forward-looking estimations. Banks have to categorize ECL norms for assessing the quality of assets and the expected loss. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 154 ECL Norms Banks classify financial assets (primarily loans, including irrevocable loan com- mitments, and investments classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale) into three categories: Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3. Stage 1: Financial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk or with low credit risk at the reporting date. Stage 2: Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk but don’t have objective evidence of impair- ment. Stage 3: Financial assets that have objec- tive evidence of impairment at the report- ing date 4. SURETY BONDS Context: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of In- dia (Irdai) has relaxed norms for ‘surety bonds’. The changes introduced: The solvency requirement for surety bonds has been re- duced to 1.5 times from the previous 1.875 times, and the exposure limit of 30% applicable to each contract underwrit- ten by an insurer has been removed. Aim of the changes: The changes are aimed at expanding the surety insurance market and increasing the availability of such products. What is Surety Bond? A surety bond is a type of insurance policy that ensures par- ties involved in a contract are protected from financial losses if one party fails to fulfil its obligations. Example: If a construction company fails to complete a project as agreed, the surety bond compensates the client for the loss- es. It ensures financial protection and guarantees that the contract will be fulfilled. About IRDAI: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (est. 1999; HQ: Hyderabad) is a statutory body under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. It is tasked with regulating and licensing the insurance and re-insurance in- dustries in India. 5.RBI PAYOUT TO GOVERNMENT 6. SAMARTH CAMPAIGN Context: SAMARTH campaign was launched to promote digital trans- actions at Gram Panchayat Level About the Campaign: The SAMARTH campaign is an initiative launched by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, to promote digital transactions at the Gram Panchayat level in rural areas. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 155 Aim: • To increase the adoption of digital payment methods, particularly among women, in 50,000 Gram Panchayats across the country. • It seeks to empower rural communities by enabling them to participate in the digital economy and access the benefits of digital transactions. It is part of the larger AmritMahotsav celebrations and is be- ing implemented under the AzadiKaAmritMahotsav, which commemorates 75 years of India’s independence. Don’t get confused with a similar named initiative: Samarth Scheme (search in FFP section) (under Ministry of Textiles) 7. LIBERALIZED REMITTANCE SCHEME (LRS) Context: Finance Ministry has announced that it will waive the 20% tax on overseas credit card spending for individuals up to ₹7 lakh per financial year, following criticism and concerns raised by taxpayers and businesses. What is the issue? The Reserve Bank of India had introduced a provision to capture overseas credit card spending under the LRS, which allows individuals to remit forex up to $2.5 lakhs annually. However, the government’s plan to impose a 20% tax on such spending faced backlash, leading to its current decision to exempt spending up to ₹7 lakh and the continuation of beneficial treatment for education and health payments, under the LRS. About the LRS Scheme: Description Definition of Remittance In the context of the Liberalized Remit- tance Scheme (LRS), remittance refers to the transfer of foreign exchange (forex) by resident individuals in India for various purposes. About the scheme The LRS sets the limit on the amount of money that can be remitted by individuals without requiring specific approvals from regulatory authorities. Under LRS (introduced in 2004), Indian in- dividuals can send money outside up to a maximum of $250,000 in a year. Aim Simplify the process of remitting money outside India and encourage foreign in- vestments by Indian individuals Permissible Transactions Education, travel, medical treatment, gift- ing, investment in shares or property, etc. Non-Permis- sible Trans- actions Trading in foreign exchange or buying lot- tery tickets Ineligible En- tities Corporations, partnership firms, Hindu Un- divided Family (HUF), Trusts, etc. Benefits Diversify investments and assets, finance foreign education or travel Issues Outward remittances may pressure Forex reserves Repatriation Directive In August 2022, RBI had directed that any money remitted overseas by Indian residents that remains unutilised for more than 180 days needs to be repatriated back into India. 8. CENTRE FOR PROCESSING ACCELERATED CORPORATE EXIT (C-PACE) Context: The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has established the Centre for Processing Accelerated Corporate Exit (C-PACE) to centralize the process of striking off companies from the MCA Register. What is striking off? Striking off companies from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Register means removing defunct, non-operational, or dissolved companies from the official database. C-PACE (founded: March 2023; HQ: at the office of Indi- an Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) in Gurgaon) aims to ensure a clean registry, provides hassle-free filing and timely, process-bound striking off of company names from the Register. •\t C-PACE operates through the Registrar of Compa- nies (RoC) and is part of MCA’s efforts to improve the Ease of Doing Business and facilitate company exits. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 156 9. CLEARING CORPORATIONS Context: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Union’s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has derecognised six Indian central counterparties (CCPs) from April 30, 2023. What are Clearing corporations (CC)? CC is an organization associated with an exchange to handle the confirmation, settlement, and delivery of transactions in a prompt and efficient manner. Examples of CCs: The CCPs are The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL), Indi- an Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL), NSE Clearing Ltd (NSCCL), Multi Commodity Exchange Clearing (MCXCCL), India Inter- national Clearing Corporation (IFSC) Ltd (IICC), and NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Ltd (NICCL). Why has ESMA derecognized Indian CCs? The decision to derecognise Indian CCPs came due to ‘no cooperation arrangements’ between ESMA and Indian reg- ulators – the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the International Finan- cial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). Impact: As per the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR), a CCP in a third country can provide clearing services to European banks only if it is recognised by ESMA. With the withdrawal of recognition, these CCPs will no longer be able to provide services to clearing members and trading venues established in the EU. Government’s stand – ESMA’s threat is unreasonable since all clearing corporations are well-regulated in India. 10.FRONT-RUNNING 11. LIBOR 12. SNOWBALL EFFECT Context: According to the World Economic Forum president India witnessing a ‘snowball effect’; set to see exponential growth in coming years. About the Snowball effect: When the snowball starts to roll, it gets bigger and bigger, and that is what is happening with the Indian economy - the growth will lead to more investments, and more jobs lead- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 157 ing to exponential growth in the coming years. 13. EVERGREENING OF LOANS Context: Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor raised red flags over banks adopting innovative methods for ev- ergreening of loans – covering up the real status of stressed loans of corporates. About Evergreening of loans: • Evergreening of loans refers to a practice where banks or lenders provide additional funds or take other mea- sures to artificially sustain a loan that is not being re- paid as scheduled. • It is a temporary solution used by banks to avoid classi- fying the loan as a non-performing asset (NPA) because such classification would require them to set aside more money for potential losses, which could affect their profitability. Methods used by banks for Evergreening of loans: • Bringing two lenders together to evergreen each oth- er’s loans. • Good borrowers are being persuaded to enter into structured deals with stressed borrowers. 14. ‘LIGHTWEIGHT’ PAYMENTS SYSTEM Context: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has conceptualised a light- weight payment and settlements system, which can be op- erated from anywhere by a bare minimum staff in exigen- cies such as natural calamities or war. • The infrastructure for this system will be indepen- dent of the technologies that underlie the existing systems of payments such as UPI, NEFT, and RTGS. Difference between UPI and lightweight system: • The key difference lies in the resilience and availability of the two systems. • UPI and other conventional systems prioritize handling large transaction volumes and require a stable and ro- bust infrastructure. • On the other hand, the lightweight system is designed to operate even in volatile and extreme conditions when regular payment systems may not be accessible. Benefits: • Such a system could ensure near-zero downtime of the payment and settlement system in the country and keep the liquidity pipeline of the economy alive and intact by facilitating the uninterrupted functioning of es- sential payments. • By implementing a lightweight system as a backup, the RBI aims to ensure that individuals and institutions can continue to make payments during emergencies or dis- ruptions to the conventional payment infrastructure. • It serves as a precautionary measure to be prepared for extreme situations and maintain the continuity of financial transactions. 15. STARTUP INDIA SEED FUND SCHEME Context: The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is conducting a third-party impact assessment of the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme to evaluate its perfor- mance in benefiting the startup community. About Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS): Aspect Details SISFS was created by DPIIT, Ministry of Commerce and In- dustry in 2021. It aims to provide financial assistance to start-ups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market-entry, and commercialization.

Seed Funding is an early stage of investment in a start-up or a new business idea to help the company reach a point where it can secure ad- ditional rounds of funding or generate revenue to become self-sustaining. 16. US DEBT CEILING DEAL Context: The US government is facing a crucial issue regarding the debt ceiling. About Debt Ceiling: Topic Debt Ceiling Definition The maximum amount of money that the US government is legally allowed to bor- row to fund its operations and meet its fi- nancial obligations. It sets a cap or limit on the total amount of government debt. Origin Established by the US Congress in 1917 during World War I to promote fiscal re- sponsibility in the federal government. Issue Disagreement between President Joe Biden (executive) and the Republi- can-controlled US Congress (Legislature) on raising the debt ceiling. The decision to increase the borrowing cap lies with the US Congress, which needs to vote on it. Impact Possible government default if the debt ceiling is not raised, leading to econom- ic consequences such as a weaker dollar, stock market problems, and job losses. The downgrade of the US credit rating made future borrowing more expensive for the government. Hinders discussions on long-term fiscal challenges and has become a political tool instead of a responsible fiscal mechanism. Impact on In- dia Increased volatility in financial markets affects currency exchange rates, capital flows, and investor confidence. Impact on India’s exports, foreign direct investment, and overall economic stabili- ty. Previous in- stance In 2011, the US faced a near default on public debt due to a delay in raising the debt ceiling. This led to the first down- grade in the US credit rating, a sharp drop in the stock market, and higher borrowing costs. Suggestions for reforms Automatic increase of the debt limit when- ever legislation is passed or abolishing the debt limit altogether India’s Debt Ceiling Mech- anism India does not have a formal debt ceil- ing mechanism like the one in the United States. The Indian government manages borrow- ing and debt obligations through fiscal dis- cipline, budgetary controls, and oversight by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Manage- ment (FRBM) Act governs India’s borrow- ing activities, setting targets for fiscal defi- cits and debt-to-GDP ratios. 17.

MANUFACTURED SAND (M-SAND) Context: The Rajasthan government has announced its support for the use of manufactured sand (M-Sand) as a cost-effective and convenient alternative to river sand • As per the M-Sand Rajasthan policy introduced in 2021, it is mandatory to use at least 25% M-Sand in government construction projects. • M-Sand units have been granted industrial status, allowing them to benefit from the Rajasthan Indus- trial Promotion Scheme (RIPS) 2019, which includes subsidies and concessions on taxes and fees. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 164 What is M sand? M-Sand, or Manufactured Sand, is an alternative to natural river sand used in construction. It is produced by crushing rocks or quarry stones to obtain sand particles of consistent size and shape. Advantages: It has similar properties to natural sand, making it suitable for various construction purposes. It is cost-effective, readily available, and reduces the need for mining natural sand. It also requires less water for construction projects as it does not need to be washed before use. Differences between M-Sand and natural sand: Aspect M-Sand Natural Sand P ar tic le Shape Cubic form, en- hancing bonding Flaky, sharp, and an- gular grains Silt Content Zero silt content Silt content ranging from 3-20% Quality Con- trol Manufactured in a controlled environ- ment No strict control, and variations in silt con- tent Co n cr e t e Strength High concrete strength Lower concrete strength Availability Requires produc- tion and availabili- ty may vary Naturally occurring, availability depends on the riverbed Environmen- tal Impact Reduces the need for natural sand mining, repurpos- es waste materials This can lead to en- vironmental degra- dation, habitat de- struction, and water scarcity Cost-ef fe c - tiveness Can be more cost-effective as it can be produced in large quantities at a lower cost Cost may vary based on availability and lo- cation Sand is classified as a ‘minor mineral’ under Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, and administrative control vests with State Governments.

NUTRIENTS IN MILLETS AFFECTED BY PROCESSING AND POLISHING Context: Recent studies have shown that grain processing reduces nutritional qualities in millets. About Millets: • Millets are grasses and include varieties such as pearl millet, barnyard millet, finger millet, and foxtail millet. • India is the world’s largest producer of millets, account- ing for over 40% of pearl millet production and over 8% of sorghum production in 2021-2022. • Millets are drought-tolerant and thrive on marginal land. Their nutrient content includes carbohydrates, proteins, fibre, amino acids, and various minerals, and different millet varieties have different nutrient pro- files. Nutrient Changes during Millet Processing: Processing Step Effect on Nutrients Removal of Husk Reduction of phytic acid and poly- phenol contents Decortication Removal of crude and dietary fibre Milling and Sieving Reduction of nutrient content due to loss of bran, but improved digestibil- ity and accessibility Germination and Fermentation Positive improvement in overall nu- tritional characteristics Polishing Removal of protein, fat, and fibre contents, as well as iron, magne- sium, phosphorus, potassium, and manganese 36.MINIMUM IMPORT PRICE FOR APPLES Context: The Central Government of India has introduced the Mini- mum Import Price (MIP) for apples in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) to protect the domestic industry from unfair competi- tion and predatory pricing. What is MIP? MIP is a temporary measure implemented by a government to protect domestic industries from unfair competition and predatory pricing of imported goods. The MIP sets a mini- mum price below which the import of a particular commod- ity is not allowed. Who frames the rules: The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) is the arm of the commerce ministry responsible for framing rules re- lated to exports and imports, including the implementation of MIPs. Significance: By setting a minimum import price, the government aims to prevent apple imports from flooding the market at exces- sively low prices, and provide a level playing field to farmers in J&K. About Apple cultivation: Apple cultivation in India primarily takes place in regions such as Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, the hills of Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. It is also grown to a lesser extent in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Punjab, and Sik- kim. China produces the world’s largest number of apples. India is ranked 5th. Climatic condition for Apples: The ideal climatic conditions for apple cultivation include an average summer temperature of 21-24 degrees Celsius during the active growth period. Apple trees can be grown at altitudes ranging from 1500 to 2700 meters above sea level. Well-distributed rainfall of 1000-1250 mm through- out the growing season is most favourable for the optimal growth and fruitfulness of apple trees. Additionally, apples thrive best in well-drained, loamy soils. 37. SUNFLOWER OIL Context: The Ukraine-Russia war had a significant impact on sunflow- er oil consumption in India. Status of Sunflower Oil: Globally: • Ukraine (the highest producer) and Russia account for 60% of the world’s sunflower oil production • Other top producers of sunflower oil globally include Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Romania, and Bulgaria Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 167 In India: • Sunflower oil is the fourth most consumed edible oil in India, following mustard, soybean, and palm oil. • Domestic production of sunflower oil has significantly declined over the past decade, unlike soybean oil, which has expanded its cultivated area. • India imports a substantial amount of sunflower oil due to limited domestic production. • Major producers: Karnataka (highest producer in India); Telangana and Maharashtra • Major Consumer: Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharash- tra About Sunflower: Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), popularly known as “Surajmukhi” (it follows the sun by day) is an annual flow- ering plant, native to North and Central America but is now cultivated worldwide for its versatile uses. It is known for its large, bright yellow flowers. Sunflowers are relatively easy to grow and are adaptable to different climates and soil types. They require full sun exposure and well-drained soil. They are known for their ability to extract heavy metals from the soil, making them useful in phytoremediation efforts to clean up polluted ar- eas. 38.

POLICY ON RARE DISEASES Context: The Delhi HC constituted a five-member ‘National Rare Dis- eases Committee’ to implement the National Rare Disease Policy-2021 efficiently and to “ensure that the benefits of the policy reach the ultimate patients of rare disease”. Rare Diseases • A rare disease, also referred to as an orphan disease, is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. • There are 6,000-8,000 classified rare diseases, but less than 5% have therapies available to treat them. • Examples: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD), Pompe disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, spina bi- fida, haemophilia etc. • About 95% of rare diseases have no approved treat- ment and less than 1 in 10 patients receive dis- ease-specific treatment. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 170 44. WORLD THALASSEMIA DAY Context: The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) launched the III phase of the Thalassemia Bal Sewa Yojana (TBSY) to commemorate World Thalassemia Day (May 8). Thalassemia: • Thalassemia is an inherited (passed from parents to children through genes) blood disorder caused when the body doesn’t make enough of a protein called haemoglobin, an important part of RBCs. • It’s a treatable disorder that can be well-managed with blood transfusions and chelation therapy. Steps taken in India: • The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016: Thalassemia was recognised as a benchmark disabil- ity. • TBSY: Coal India Limited, under the auspices of the MoH&FW, is implementing TBSY (since 2017) as part of its CSR initiative to support the treatment of chil- dren affected by Thalassemia and Aplastic Anaemia. • National mission to tackle thalassemia: The Union government will soon launch the mission with a country-wide screening exercise. 45. MPOX 46.ARSENIC CONTAMINATION Context: A recent peer-reviewed study suggests that even low levels of arsenic consumption, commonly found in contaminated groundwater in India, can impact cognitive function in chil- dren, adolescents, and young adults. What does the study say: • Arsenic exposure leads to reduced grey matter in the brain, affecting concentration, information storage, and switching between tasks. • At the population level, contamination leads to in- creased school failures, diminished economic productiv- ity, and a higher risk of criminal and antisocial behaviour. • The major factor for contamination: Arsenic intake from food, primarily through rice consumption; using contam- inated groundwater. Remedy: Modifying food preparation techniques, such as cooking rice in a specific way, can significantly reduce arsenic levels; pro- moting piped water access and installing arsenic removal plants; encourage extraction from aquifers (water channels below the ground) that are deeper than 100 m. About Arsenic: Arsenic is an odourless and tasteless met- alloid found naturally in the earth’s crust and groundwater. It is highly toxic in its inorganic form and can cause arse- nic poisoning. Arsenicosis, the accumulation of high levels of arsenic in the body, leads to adverse health effects and can result in multi-system organ failure and death. Efforts have been made under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to provide safely managed drinking water free of arsenic contamination. The Jal Jeevan Mission aims to provide safe drinking water to all households in rural and urban India by 2024. 47. WHO’S ADVICE ON NON-SUGAR SWEETENERS Context: The WHO’s new guidelines advise against the use of non-sug- ar sweeteners (NSS) as a “healthy” alternative to sugar. Non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) Meaning They are marketed as low or no-calorie al- ternatives to free sugars which aid in weight loss, and in controlling blood glucose in indi- viduals with diabetes. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 171 Categories Aspartame (to sweeten diet colas), advan- tame, cyclamates, neotame, saccharin (to sweeten tea or coffee), sucralose, stevia, etc. Rise in Pop- ularity In 2015, when WHO said that a high intake of free sugars is linked to weight gain and obesity. WHO’s new guidelines? NSS should not be used as a means of achieving weight control or reducing the risk of diet-related non-communicable dis- eases. Long-term use of NSS could lead to increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovas- cular diseases, chronic kidney disease and cancer. Co n cern s for India One in 9 women and one in 25 men are obese (NFHS5), and an estimated 25 mil- lion people living with pre-diabetes in India (WHO).

LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES BACTERIA Context: The United Kingdom Food Standards Agency (FSA) has is- sued a recall for several Cadbury-branded dessert products due to potential contamination by Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. What are Listeria monocytogenes bacteria? Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria that can cause infection in humans and animals. It is commonly found in soil, water, and some animals’ intestines. Listeria is typically spread through contaminated food, particularly ready-to-eat foods such as cooked meats, dairy products, and fresh pro- duce. Symptoms: Symptoms of a Listeria infection can include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick, and diarrhoea. Impact: Listeriosis, the illness caused by Listeria infection, can lead to serious complications, such as meningitis, sepsis, and miscarriage. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 49. BIOSYNTHETIC CLOCK Context: Scientists have discovered that the ageing process of cells is controlled by a genetic regulatory circuit that can be manip- ulated to extend their lifespan. This circuit functions like a clock, guiding the cell through two distinct pathways of ageing. By manipulating this cir- cuit, scientists have been able to generate a negative feed- back loop that slows down the cell’s degeneration, leading to a significant extension of cellular lifespan. Significance: This research may have important implications for improv- ing human health and treating age-related diseases in the future. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 172 50. FOUCAULT PENDULUM Context: A Foucault pendulum has been installed inside the new Parliament which is designed by the National Council of Sci- ence Museums, Kolkata. • Invented by French physicist Léon Foucault in the mid-19th Century, the pendulum provided the first laboratory demonstration in history to show that the Earth spins on its axis. The pendulum in the new Parliament is meant to symbolise the ‘integration of the idea of India with that of the universe’. About Foucault Pendulum: • The pendulum consists of a heavy bob suspended at the end of a long, strong wire from a fixed point in the ceiling. As the pendulum swings, the imaginary surface across which the wire and the bob swipe is called the plane of the swing. Why is it important: • It helped us understand that the Earth is rotating or spinning. As it swings back and forth, it seems to change its direction over time. • This happens because while the pendulum swings, the Earth is spinning beneath making it look like the pendulum is changing its direction. This effect is called the Coriolis effect. Depending on where you are on Earth, the pendulum will appear to rotate in different ways. • For example, if you’re in the Northern Hemisphere (like in Europe or North America), the pendulum will rotate clockwise. But if you’re in the Southern Hemi- sphere (like in Australia or South America), it will ro- tate counterclockwise. • By observing this rotation, scientists like Foucault were able to prove that the Earth is spinning on its axis. 51. SLUDGE TO FERTILIZER Context: A recent study conducted by the Indian Institute of Tech- nology (IIT)-Roorkee has found that the sludge from sewage treatment plants (STP) in India, which is rich in organic chem- icals, has “high potential” for use as fertilizer. About sludge: Topic Information Definition Sludge is the thick residue that remains after the treatment of sewage or wastewater in a sewage treatment plant. Composi- tion Sludge is rich in organ- ic chemicals, heavy metals, industrial ef- fluents and bacterial contaminants. Treatment The sludge needs to be stored for at least three months to kill pathogens and blended with cattle manure and husk or local soil to reduce the heavy metal content. Go v e r n - ment Ini- tiative National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCC) has launched “Arth Ganga” to monetise and reuse treated wastewater and sludge by con- verting it into usable products such as ma- nure and bricks. Classifica- tion As per the United States Environment Pro- tection Agency standards, treated sludge can be classified as Class A and Class B. India does not yet have such standards. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 173 Class A Vs Class B sludge Class A sludge can be disposed of in the open and used as organic fertilizer without any safety concerns. On the other hand, Class B sludge can only be used in restricted agricultural applications where edible parts of the crop are not ex- posed to the sludge-mixed soil, and people or animals do not come into extensive contact. 52. MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION TREAT- MENT (MDT) Context: A baby has been born in the UK using a technique called mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT) (popularly called ‘Three Parents Baby’), which involves using the DNA of three people in an effort to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases. Working: The procedure combines the sperm and eggs from the bi- ological parents with mitochondria from a donor’s eggs. Harmful mutations in mitochondria, which are inherited only from the mother, can affect all the children a woman has. As of now, the technique is still in its experimental stage. Approximately 1 in 5,000-10,000 children are born each year with mitochondrial disease. Concerns: Development of de- signer babies, dilutes parenthood, costly in nature etc. 53. CALCIUM-41 Context: A recent study has proposed using calcium-41 as a new method for radiometric dating, similar to carbon-14 dating but with several advantages. What is radiocarbon dating? Radiocarbon dating, also known as carbon-14 dating, is a method used to determine the age of organic materials that originated from living organisms. It relies on the radioactive isotope carbon-14, which is a variant of the element carbon. Carbon-14 is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay over time. Limitations of Carbon-14 dating: • Limited Time Range: Carbon-14 dating is effective for objects up to approximately 50,000 years old due to the short half-life of carbon-14 (5,700 years). • Contamination Issues: Contamination from modern car- bon sources can affect the accuracy of carbon-14 dating, leading to inaccurate age estimates. • Incomplete Preservation: Organic materials must be well-preserved to contain sufficient carbon-14 for dat- ing. Poor preservation or exposure to environmental fac- tors can compromise the reliability of carbon-14 dating. Advantages of Calcium-41: • Longer Half-Life: Calcium-41 has a much longer half-life of 99,400 years, allowing for the dating of much older materials compared to carbon-14. • Abundance in Earth’s Crust: Calcium-41 is found in the Earth’s crust, making it available for dating various geo- logical materials, including fossilized bones and rocks. • Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA): The technique of ATTA enables the detection of calcium-41 atoms with high sensitivity and selectivity, improving the accuracy of dating methods. • Potential for Extension: The successful application of ATTA to calcium-41 opens the possibility of using simi- lar techniques for other metal isotopes, expanding the range of dating methods available. • Earth-Science Applications: Calcium-41 and ATTA can be used to study geological processes, such as determining how long rocks have been covered by ice, providing valu- able insights into Earth’s history and climate changes. 54. PANGENOME MAP Context: A pangenome reference map has been built using genomes from 47 anonymous individuals from Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas, East Asia, and Europe. About Pangenome Map Topic Description What is Pange- nome Map? A pangenome map is a way of looking at the collective genetic information of a group of related organisms or species. It goes beyond just one individual’s genetic makeup and considers the genetic diver- sity within that group. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 174 What is ge- nome and genome se- quencing? The human genome refers to the entire set of DNA in the nucleus of every cell in the human body. It is like an identity card (e.g., Aadhar) unique to each indi- vidual. Genome sequencing is a method used to determine the precise order and arrangement of the four letters (A, T, G, and C) in the genome. It helps us un- derstand human diversity at the genet- ic level and our susceptibility to certain diseases. What is a ref- erence ge- nome? A reference genome is a complete set of genetic information for a specific indi- vidual. When newly sequenced genomes are compared, they are matched against a reference map called a reference ge- nome. How pange- nome map is different from the Reference genome? While a reference genome represents a single individual, a pangenome map cap- tures the genetic diversity and variation across multiple individuals or popula- tions. Principle The concept of a pangenome acknowl- edges that a species’ genome is not a fixed entity and is different for different individuals. This genetic variation con- tributes to differences in traits, disease susceptibility, and other biological char- acteristics. Why is a p a n g en o me map import- ant? A pangenome map provides a compre- hensive understanding of a species’ ge- netic content. This helps explain genetic differences, and human diversity, study gene evolution, identify disease-associ- ated genes, and understand the overall genomic architecture of a species. This can shed light on disease preva- lence, aid in discovering new genes for rare diseases, design better diagnostic methods, and facilitate the discovery of novel drugs for those diseases. P a n g en o me map and India The current pangenome map does not include genome sequences from Indi- ans. However, it can still help map Indian genomes against existing error-free and complete reference genomes. 55.

ASTR Context: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has launched the Artificial Intelligence and Facial Recognition powered Solution for Telecom SIM Subscriber Verification (ASTR) tool to detect and block fraudulent mobile connections. About ASTR: Dimensions Description Purpose To detect and block fraudulent mobile connections Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 175 Origin In 2012, the DoT ordered telecom oper- ators to share their subscriber database, including user pictures. These images form the basis for the facial recognition algorithm used in ASTR. The ASTR proj- ect was developed by the DoT’s unit in Haryana between April 2021 and July 2021. T ech n o l o gy Used Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Facial Rec- ognition Functionality Analyzing subscriber databases to iden- tify multiple connections associated with the same person Example of its working Suppose there is a suspected face as- sociated with multiple mobile con- nections. ASTR will compare this face against a database of images to iden- tify other connections linked to the same face. If there are more than nine connections against a single individual’s photograph or if the same person has taken SIMs under different names, ASTR will flag it as potentially fraudulent. C onne c tion Limit Currently, a maximum of nine mobile connections can be taken using a single identity proof Action Taken The list of fraudulent connections will be shared with telecom operators, banks, payment wallets, and social media plat- forms Description of technology used: Image Process- ing Faces in subscriber images are encod- ed using convolutional neural network (CNN) models Face Compari- son A face comparison is carried out for each face against all faces in the data- base to group similar faces under one directory Matching Accu- racy Faces are considered identical if they match to the extent of at least 97.5% Name Matching “Fuzzy logic” is used to find similarity or approximate matches for subscriber names, accounting for typographical er- rors What is fuzzy logic? Fuzzy logic is a mathematical approach that deals with uncertainty and impre- cise information. It allows for the rep- resentation of vagueness and partial truth, unlike traditional binary logic. 57.ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYS- TEMS (ADAS) Context: Car manufacturers have started providing ADAS which could create a safe traffic environment resulting in reduced acci- dental death.

CoWIN platform scaled India’s vaccine delivery services. 60. EU CODE OF PRACTICE AGAINST DISIN- FORMATION Context: Twitter has decided to leave the EU’s disinformation code, a voluntary pact that groups together the major social plat- forms. A new law the Digital Services Act (DSA) is set to take effect - which establishes requirements for monitoring and flag- ging disinformation, which would make the now voluntary agreement mandatory for large social media sites. Reason: Twitter wants to avoid certain legal liabilities that come with being part of the code. By leaving the code, Twitter may be able to operate more independently and on its own terms. About DSA: • The DSA, an expansion of the current voluntary agree- ment, will require large digital platforms like Twitter to monitor and demonetize disinformation and bot farms on their sites, offer transparent warnings about political advertising, and empower fact-checking. • It does not require the site to remove content but does require offering users ways to report illicit con- tent SPACE TECHNOLOGY 61.STARBERRYSENSE Context: The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) recently launched a new low-cost star sensor called StarBerrySense on board PSLV C-55.

COSMIC DUST PARTICLES Context: Indian scientists (from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics) have created a computer model of cosmic dust particles that can imitate the unique way interstellar comet 2I/Bor- isov scatters light. Use: By studying the way light scatters off these cosmic par- ticles, they can better understand how comets behave. The model accurately reproduced the scattering of light seen in experiments and observations. It revealed the presence of a large number of porous cosmic dust particles. Cosmic dust particles: Description About Cosmic dust particles are tiny solid par- ticles that exist in outer space. They are composed of various materials, including minerals, metals, ice, and organic com- pounds. Shape From spherical to irregular or fractal-like structures. Size Ranging from nanometers to micrometres Composition Amorphous silicate (Forsterite) and amor- phous carbon Found in Cosmic dust particles can be found in dif- ferent environments, such as interstellar space, planetary systems, and the atmo- spheres of planets and moons. Role played They contribute to the formation of stars and planetary systems by providing mate- rial for accretion. They also scatter and ab- sorb light, affecting the radiation proper- ties of celestial objects. Additionally, these particles serve as building blocks for the formation of larger objects, such as aster- oids, comets, and planets. 66. CHINA SENDS ITS 1ST CIVILIAN TO SPACE Context: China’s Shenzhou-16 spacecraft has been launched with three astronauts, including the first Chinese civilian, to the Tiangong space station. Aim of the mission: To replace the crew of Shenzhou-15 and conduct tests and experiments over the next five months. About Tiangong Space Station: Tiangong Space Station Description It is a Chinese space station be- ing built in low Earth orbit as a part of the China Manned Space Program.

It will accommodate astronauts for up to 20 days in space (an extension of the Ga- ganyaan mission) 67. SEMI-CRYOGENIC ENGINE Context: An intermediate configuration of a 2000 kN semi-cryogen- ic engine was recently tested at a newly commissioned Semi-cryogenic Integrated Engine & Stage Test facility at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC) in Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu by ISRO. • It was the first in a series of tests planned to vali- date the design of a propellant feed system, includ- ing low-pressure and high-pressure turbo-pumps, gas generator, and control components. About semi-cryogenic engines: • Semi-cryogenic engines are a type of rocket engine that use a combination of liquid and gaseous pro- pellants. They are called “semi-cryogenic” because they operate at temperatures higher than cryogenic engines but still colder than traditional liquid rocket engines. • A semi-cryogenic engine uses refined kerosene in- stead of liquid hydrogen. Liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer. • The Semi Cryogenic Propulsion System Project en- visages the design and development of a 2000 kN semi-cryogenic engine and ‘SC120 stage’ that will enable the development of a heavy-lift capability for future Indian space transportation systems. ENVIRONMENT, CLIMATE & CON- SERVATION 68.GLOBAL TEMPERATURE LIKELY TO BREACH 1.5°C THRESHOLD BY 2027 Context: According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), global temperatures are now more likely than not to exceed the 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming threshold within the next five years. About the Finding: WMO’s Global Annual to Decadal Cli- mate Update highlights a 66% chance of temporarily ex- ceeding 1.5°C by 2027 (than the average global temperature from 1850-1900), a significant increase from last year’s esti- mate of approximately 50-50 odds. • Threshold of 1.5°C: This threshold is critical to avoid the disastrous consequences of global warming, as warned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. • Hottest year: The WMO’s predictions also indicate a 98% chance that one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, surpassing the previous re- cord set in 2016. Reason for increased likelihood: El Niño, combined with hu- man-induced climate change will contribute to higher global temperatures. Significance: This represents the first time in history that surpassing 1.5°C is considered more probable than not, thus indicating an alarming trend. Impact on India: The increased temperature will likely lead to lower monsoon rainfall. Hotter oceans also contribute to stronger cyclones (e.g., Cyclone Mocha). India, with its reli- ance on rain-fed agriculture and a long coastline, will face significant challenges due to global climate changes. Measures needed: Improving forecasting capabilities for cy- clones and weather anomalies is crucial, but building resil- ience through investments in disaster-related infrastructure is equally important. India must prioritize infrastructure development to defend against the increasing threat of cli- mate-related disasters. About WMO: The World Meteorological Organization (founded: 1950; HQ: Geneva; Parent organization: UN Eco- nomic and Social Council) is a specialized agency of the UN responsible for promoting international cooperation on at- mospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 180 69. GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS WATCH Context: The World Meteorological Congress - the supreme deci- sion-making body of WMO, approved (in its 19th session) a new greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring initiative - Global Greenhouse Gas Watch. Background: In 2022, the WMO Executive Council decid- ed to develop an architecture for a global Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure to build on and expand WMO’s long-standing activities in GHG monitoring. The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (G3W): It aims to estab- lish internationally coordinated monitoring of GHG fluxes (top-down) to support the provision of actionable informa- tion to the UNFCCC Parties and other stakeholders Need: • Currently, most GHG monitoring undertaken glob- ally relies heavily on research capabilities and re- search funding. • The intermittent nature of research funding and the competitive processes used for its allocation makes sustained global monitoring difficult to achieve. 70. CARBON CAPTURE COALITION Context: Carbon Capture Coalition have challenged a United Nations (UN) document that questions the effectiveness of carbon removal technologies in combatting global warming. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recog- nizes the need to remove billions of tonnes of carbon annu- ally to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But some environmental campaigners criticize carbon removal for al- lowing continued fossil fuel production. About the Coalition: The Carbon Capture Coalition is a collaborative group con- sisting of more than 100 companies, unions, NGOs, con- servation and environmental policy organizations. Their goal is to promote policy support for the widespread de- ployment of carbon management technologies, including carbon capture, removal, transport, reuse, and storage. The Great Plains Institute convenes the Coalition, which includes members from various industries, labour unions, and policy organizations. 71. IMPACT OF WARMING ON THE AQUAT- IC ANIMALS Context: According to a new study published in the eLife journal, warm waters will cause aquatic animals, particularly fish, to grow larger rather than shrink in size due to global warm- ing. New findings: The study found that warm waters will increase both the growth rates and death rates of fish, resulting in a young- er but larger fish population. This contradicts the previous theory that fish will grow faster at a young age but reach smaller body sizes as adults as aquatic ecosystems become warmer. Other impacts: Impact of Warming on Aquatic Animals Descriptions Decreased oxygen levels Limit growth and develop- ment of some species Changes in food availabil- ity This can lead to decreased populations Increased prevalence of diseases and parasites Can impact populations Bleaching of coral reefs Loss of habitat for a diverse array of species The decline of coral reef ecosystems This can lead to declines in populations of fish and in- vertebrates 72.TIPPING POINTS Context: A study suggests that climate change could push up to 30% of species over tipping points as their geographic ranges ex- perience unforeseen temperatures. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 181 About Tipping Points: Description Definition ‘Tipping points’ are thresholds where the earth’s systems can no longer sta- bilize. Crossing these points becomes more dangerous with increased warm- ing. Explanation For example, the melting of Greenland’s ice can reach a tipping point where the ice loss accelerates, leading to a signifi- cant rise in sea levels. Examples of tip- ping point Melting of Greenland ice; Collapse of Antarctic glaciers (resulting in sea lev- el rise); Destruction of Amazon forests; Melting of all permafrost, etc. Recent Findings Five dangerous tipping points may have already been passed due to 1.1°C of global heating caused by human ac- tivity. Impacts on Ani- mals When their geographic ranges experi- ence unfamiliarly hot temperatures, up to 30% of species could be at risk. This can lead to habitat loss and po- tential extinction. Animals may need to adapt or migrate to cooler regions, but the short timeframe makes it challeng- ing. Actions Needed Urgent action to reduce carbon emis- sions is crucial to mitigate harm and prevent an extinction crisis. Conserva- tion efforts should be guided by early warning systems to protect vulnerable species. 73. CLIMATE REPARATIONS Context: A new study has found that the world’s top 21 fossil fuel companies owed over US $ 5 trillion in climate reparations, to be disbursed over a 26-year period from 2025 to 2050. The companies with the highest reparations: ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Shell. About Climate reparations: Description Definition Climate reparations aim to rectify climate injustice by requiring those most respon- sible for climate change to provide sup- port to those who have been wronged. Principles of Climate Repa- rations Polluter pays principle (Polluters should be held liable for the costs of remedi- al action); More responsibility of rich countries (for past historical emissions); Reparations-based approach to climate refugees; Rich countries should provide financial and technological support to de- veloping nations Steps Taken Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) (Established in 2013 to compensate de- veloping countries affected by climate di- sasters); Green Climate Fund (promise of $100 billion per year by 2020); Least De- veloped Countries Fund Ad d i ti o n a l Me asur e s Needed for Reparations Establish an international compensa- tion commission to handle claims from countries that have incurred adaptation expenses, similar to the United Nations Claims Commission; Prioritize adaptation measures; Establish a separate channel for loss and damages; Long-term climate finance; enforce legal measures for petro- leum companies to share a part of their profit for GHG mitigation efforts 74.

E.g., Mettur, Krishnara- jasagar, Nagarjuna Sagar, and Idama- layar, showed a decline in lake levels and storage Global lakes Global lakes contribute to 95% of the total lake water storage on Earth. 53% of the world’s largest lakes have been losing water, while 24% have seen an increase in water levels. Global population affected Nearly 33% of the global population resides in a basin with a large, drying lake. Role of climate change Climate change, including tempera- ture, precipitation, and runoff, was identified as one of the main drivers of water losses Other factors con- tributing to lake decline Human water consumption, potential evapotranspiration, and sedimen- tation were identified as additional factors contributing to the decline of lakes. Measures needed Integrated approaches to lake man- agement are crucial to address the declining trends 78. PEOPLE’S BIODIVERSITY REGISTER Context: The National Campaign for Updation and Verification of People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR) was launched in Goa, by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Aim: It is aimed to document and preserve India’s rich bio- logical diversity. About PBR: The People’s Biodiversity Register serves as a comprehen- sive record of locally available Bio-resources including the landscape and demography of a particular area or village. It is prepared by Biodiversity Management Committees (under Biodiversity Act 2002) in consultation with local communities. About Biodiversity Management Committees BMCs are local bodies created under the Biological Diver- sity Act 2002, with the mandate to ensure the conserva- tion, sustainable utilization and equitable sharing of ben- efits from biodiversity. The act has made it mandatory for every local self-gov- erning institution in rural and urban areas to consti- tute Biodiversity Management Committees within their area of jurisdiction. BMC must prepare a PBR in consulta- tion with local people. Kolkata was the first major metropolitan city in India to make a detailed People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR). Previ- ously, the Forest Survey of India’s report had flagged the West Bengal Capital for the least greenery among all met- ro cities. 79.

INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE ACTION IN CIVIL AVIATION 82. GREAT NICOBAR ISLAND (GNI) PROJECT Context: Citing alleged violations under the FRA 2006, the NCST has flagged alleged discrepancies with respect to the forest clearance granted for the GNI Project. Background: • The Stage-1 clearance for the project was granted in October 2022, two years after the application was received. • The Ministry of Tribal Affairs shows that the island administration neither recognised nor granted ownership of any forest land to local tribes as per FRA before Stage-I clearance was granted. • According to the Forest Conservation Rules 2017, any diversion of forest land would first require the District Collector to recognise and vest rights to lo- cals under the FRA. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 185 The justification of the A&N administration: • The power of notification and de-notification of the land as a Tribal Reserve is solely administered under the A&N Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Act, 1956. • So there is no claim as such for settlement under the FRA 2006. The GNI Project: • It is a ₹72,000-crore mega project piloted by NITI Aayog for the “holistic development” of the Great Nicobar Island (GNI), situated at the southern end of the A&N group of Islands in the Bay of Bengal. • It is being implemented by the Andaman and Nico- bar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO). • The plan has four components - \t A ₹35,000 crore transhipment port at Gala- thea Bay, \t A dual-use military-civil international air- port, \t A power plant, and \t A township Concerns: • The project intends to use about 7.114 sq. km of tribal reserve forest land, where the Shompen (a PVTG) and the Nicobarese reside. • The northern end of the project falls in the bio- sphere reserve. 83.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) BLEND Context: India successfully flew its first commercial passenger flight using an indigenously produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend. What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of aviation fuel that is produced from renewable sources, unlike traditional fos- sil-based jet fuels. It is considered sustainable because it has a significantly lower carbon footprint and reduces green- house gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Source of SAF: It can be derived from various feedstocks, such as plant oils, agricultural waste, forestry residues, and municipal solid waste. Advantages: SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Also, it is de- signed to be a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines with- out requiring modifications. Significance for India: It is a significant milestone in India’s efforts towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. India has set a target of becoming energy self-reliant by 2047 89. REGULATING CAPTIVE BREEDING OF EXOTIC ANIMALS Context: India begins regulating the captive breeding of exotic ani- mals through a licensing system. • Those who breed exotic species protected under (CITES) and listed in Appendix 1 of Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 2022 can now obtain Breed- ers of Species Licence under the Breeders of Spe- cies Licence Rules,2023. • Appendix 1 of Schedule IV is endangered exotic an- imals (Red Panda, various species of dogs, wolves, cats, apes, chimpanzees, gibbons) and plants, and import rules are stricter for them. What is Captive Breeding? Captive breeding refers to the practice of breeding and rais- ing wild animals in controlled environments, such as zoos, wildlife centres, or specialized facilities, with the purpose of conserving and protecting endangered or threatened spe- cies. • The goal of captive breeding programs is to increase the population size of rare species and, if possible, reintroduce individuals back into their natural hab- itats. Captive breeding of exotic species protected under CITES was not regulated in the Indian laws until the recent amend- ment to the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act 2022. 90. COLD-BLOODED ANIMALS Context: Scientists have disputed the idea that as the planet warms, the bodies of cold-blooded marine species, including fish, will contract. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 188 Conventional understanding: Warming temperatures lead to smaller body sizes in cold-blooded marine animals, sug- gesting that they may actually grow larger in response to warmer waters. The recent study challenges the expectation due to several reasons: • Warm water pollution: The study suggests that warm water pollution, caused by the discharge of warm pollutants, can actually contribute to the growth of aquatic animals. • Accelerated growth at younger age: Contrary to pre- vious assumptions, the study found that cold-blood- ed animals, or ectotherms, experience faster growth at a younger age in warm waters. • Sustained growth throughout life: The study discov- ered the positive effect of warmer waters on growth and they continue to experience growth throughout their lives, leading to a larger maximum body size. • Survival trade-off: While the warmer waters provide favourable conditions for growth, they also come with higher death rates. • Influence of warm water on young populations: The research revealed that even if the water becomes in- hospitable to the fish due to excessive warmth, the growth boost is significant enough to create a larger population of young-and-large fish. Highlights of the study: Aquatic animals/ectotherms/ cold-blooded animals such as fish would actually grow larg- er due to warm water pollution, i.e., water heated by warm pollutants. 91.BURA CHAPORI WILDLIFE SANCTUARY Context: Assam government is currently taking measures to open the traditional path for wild animals from Kaziranga to Orang National Park via the Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 189 About the Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary: Dimension Details Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in Assam, on the south bank of the Brahmaputra Riv- er in Sonitpur district. Ecological Significance It forms an integral part of the Laokhowa-Burachapori ecosys- tem and is a notified buffer of the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve. Wildlife Considered an ideal habitat for the Bengal Florican Official Recognition Declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1995 Threats The sanctuary is facing illegal land encroachment. Approxi- mately 16,000 bighas of land re- covered from illegal encroachers 92.POBITORA WILDLIFE SANCTUARY Context: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Assam government in re- sponse to a plea seeking the declaration of the area around Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam as an eco-sensitive zone. What is an eco-sensitive zone? Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs) are designated areas surround- ing national parks and wildlife sanctuaries that are deemed ecologically fragile and important for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats. Areas mandated under ESZ: MoEFCC has mandated the declaration of land within 10 km of the park or sanctuary boundaries as ESZs under the Envi- ronmental (Protection) Act, 1986. However, the application of the 10-km rule can vary, and areas beyond 10 km can also be notified as ESZs if they contain significant ecological cor- ridors. Categorization of Activities: • Prohibited: Commercial mining, sawmills, polluting industries, major hydroelectric projects, and com- mercial use of wood • Regulated activities include tree felling, the estab- lishment of hotels and resorts, commercial use of natural water, the erection of electrical cables, and drastic changes in agricultural practices. • Permitted activities in ESZs include ongoing agricul- tural or horticultural practices, rainwater harvest- ing, organic farming, the use of renewable energy sources, and the adoption of green technology for all activities. About Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary: It is located in the flood plains of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, and is known for having the highest density of one-horned rhinos (EN) in the world. It is often referred to as ‘Mini Kaziranga’ due to its similar landscape and vege- tation. Approximately 72% of the sanctuary is covered by wet savannah dominated by Arundo donax and Saccha- rum, while the rest consists of water bodies. 93.
