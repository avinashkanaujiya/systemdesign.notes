Mains GS Paper II: Digital India, Important aspects of governance(e governance, accountability), ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS The Ministry of Electronics and IT has been organizing consultations on the proposed “ Digital India Bill” to build conceptual alignment on a new law that will replace the Information T echnology (IT) Act. INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context Digital India: It is an umbrella program to prepare India for a knowledge-based transformation. It weaves together a large number of ideas and thoughts into a single comprehensive vision so that each of them is seen as part of a larger goal. It has been launched by the Ministry of Electronics and Information T echnology (Meity). V ision of Digital India: 1 . Digital infrastructure as Utility to Every Citizen 2 . Governance and services on demand 3 . Digital empowerment of citizens 2 /4 Information T echnology (IT) Act, 2000: Goal of new bill: Upgrade the current legal regime to tackle emerging challenges such as user harm, competition and misinformation in the digital space. It is likely to redefine the contours of how technology is regulated, not just in India but also globally . Changes proposed: Categorisation of digital intermediaries into distinct classes such as e- commerce players, social media companies, and search engines to place dif ferent responsibilities and liabilities on each kind. 3 /4 The current IT Act: It defines an “intermediary” to include any entity between a user and the Internet IT Rules sub-classify intermediaries into three main categories: Social Media Intermediaries” (SMIs) Significant Social Media Intermediaries” (SSMIs) Online Gaming Intermediaries”. The rules lay down stringent obligations for most intermediaries, such as a 72- hour timeline for responding to law enforcement requests and resolving ‘content take down’ requests. ISPs, websites, e-commerce platforms, and cloud services are all treated similarly . Issues: Platforms such as Microsoft T eams or customer management solutions such as Zoho: By virtue of being licensed, these intermediaries have a closed user base and present a lower risk of harm from information going viral. T reating intermediaries like conventional social media platforms not only adds to their cost of doing business. It exposes them to greater liability without meaningfully reducing risks presented by the Internet. Global standing: The European Union’ s Digital Services Act is probably one of the most developed frameworks for us to consider . It introduces some exemptions and creates three tiers of intermediaries — hosting services, online platforms and “very large online platforms”, with increasing legal obligations. Australia : It created an eight-fold classification system, with separate industry- drafted codes governing categories such as social media platforms and search engines. Intermediaries are required to conduct risk assessments, based on the potential for exposure to harmful content such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or terrorism. Social Media Intermediaries(SMIs): SMIs are platforms that facilitate communication and sharing of information between users SMIs that have a very large user base (above a specified threshold) are designated as SSMIs. SMIs can encompass a variety of services such as video communications, matrimonial websites, email and even online comment sections on websites. 4 /4 Focus areas for India: A granular , product-specific classification could improve accountability and safety online, such an approach may not be future-proof. W e need a classification framework that creates a few defined categories, requires intermediaries to undertake risk assessments and uses that information to bucket them into relevant categories. The goal should also be to minimize obligations on intermediaries and ensure that regulatory tasks are proportionate to ability and size. Exempt micro and small enterprises, and caching and conduit services (the ‘pipes’ of the Internet) from any major obligations. Clearly distinguish communication services (where end-users interact with each other) from other forms of intermediaries (such as search engines and online-marketplaces). Given the lower risks, the obligations placed on intermediaries that are not communication services should be lesser . They could still be required to appoint a grievance officer , cooperate with law enforcement, identify advertising, and take down problematic content within reasonable timelines. W ay Forward Intermediaries that offer communication services c ould be asked to undertake risk assessments based on the number of their active users, risk of harm and potential for virality of harmful content. The largest communication services (platforms such as T witter) could then be required to adhere to special obligations such as appointing India-based of ficers. Setting up in-house grievance appellate mechanisms with independent external stakeholders to increase confidence in the grievance process. Alternative approaches to curbing virality , such as circuit breakers to slow down content, could also be considered. For the proposed approach to be effective, metrics for risk assessment and appropriate thresholds would have to be defined and reviewed on a periodic basis in consultation with industry . Framework could help establish accountability and online safety , while reducing legal obligations for a large number of intermediaries. It could help create a regulatory environment t hat helps achieve the government’ s policy goal of creating a safer Internet ecosystem, while also allowing businesses to thrive. QUESTION FOR PRACTICE What are the different elements of cyber security ? Keeping in view the challenges in cyber security , examine the extent to which India has successfully developed a comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategy .
