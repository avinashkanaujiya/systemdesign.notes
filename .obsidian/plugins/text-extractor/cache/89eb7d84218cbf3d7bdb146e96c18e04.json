Deep sea mining Introduction • The extraction of mineral resources from the ocean below 200 metres is called deep sea mining. • Seabed ecosystems are not yet fully explored, and depleting terrestrial deposits has driven increased demand to explore deep sea mining. • The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has decided that it will start taking permit applications from companies that want to mine the ocean floor. Methods to conduct deep sea mining • Extracting metals from polymetallic nodules on abyssal plains. • Stripping cobalt crusts from seamounts. • Extracting polymetallic sulphides from hydrothermal vents. Concerns around deep-sea mining • Deep sea is one of the most inaccessible parts of the earth. • Exploitation can cause irreversible damage to the fragile deep-sea ecosystem. • It disturbs flora and fauna that have adapted to conditions such as poor oxygen and sunlight, high pressure and extremely low temperatures. • The deep sea’s biodiversity and ecology remain poorly understood, making it difficult to assess the environmental impact and frame adequate guidelines. • It presents threats of sediment disruption, wastewater generation, and light and noise pollution. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • The historical information that will be lost forever. • The specialized drills and extraction-technology that would be required pulling out the metals from the deep sea would develop a major technical challenge. Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) • Clarion Clipperton Zone in the eastern Pacific is the most studied area of commercial interest for deep sea mining. • It contains more nickel, manganese and cobalt than all terrestrial resources combined. Status of deep-sea mining • Countries are free to carry out exploration within their borders. • Norway in June 2023 proposed opening its waters to deep sea mining. • France banned deep sea mining in its waters, while Germany has called for a pause. • India has been granted two exploration contracts so far – one for polymetallic nodules, and one for polymetallic sulphides. Way Forward • There is an urgent need for an international charter as in the absence of a clear charter, deep sea mining could cause irreversible damage. • A new set of exploration guidelines must be worked out with discussions involving multi- stakeholders like ISA, IUCN, UNCLOS, littoral nations etc.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
