Only the Mauritius government can ask CGT from him. And vice-versa. (दोहरा कराधान प�रहार समजौता) ➢ Loophole? India has ~10-20% CGT whereas Mauritius has ~0-3% CGT (depending on nature of asset, how long the buyer kept asset before selling etc). So many Indian Politicians, Businessmen and Bollywood actors would transfer the money using Hawala to their shell companies in Mauritius → make those Mauritius Cos to invest back in Indian assets → avoid Indian CGT. ➢ This process is called Round Tripping (राउंड-�ट��पंग) i.e. money that leaves the country through various channels and makes its way back into the country as foreign investment. ➢ Similar loophole in India Singapore DTAA. 2016: Modi government amended the treaties = even Mauritius and Singapore investments in India will be subjected to Indian taxes.

And all the banks and post offices where ordered to deposit such SBN into RBI.  Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Ordinance: - From 31st December 2016, RBI Governor not required to honour “I promise to pay…” or exchange the SBN. Except for NRIs: deadline little bit relaxed, with certain caveats. - Public prohibited from keeping SBN, except for research or numismatics or museum- and that too in limited amount. This ordinance became Act in 2017.  India is not the only country in the world to do demonetisation. Sweden ( 2013), European Union ( 2016) and even Pakistan (2015) has done it for their currency notes. 24.11.1 💸💸 Why Demonetise ₹ 500 & 1000?  Demonetization is usually done in the aftermath of hyperinflation, war & regime-change.  India did it to combat Corruption, Black money, Counterfeiting and Terror finance . भ्र�ाचार, काला धन, जाली नॉट,आतंक का �व�पोषण  We had 12.04% Cash to GDP ratio, one of the highest in the world. Currency printing & transportation cost alone was 1.7% of GDP.  “Soil rate” is the rate at which notes are considered to be too damaged to use and returned to the RBI. (�बगड़े/फटे �ए नोटों को �रजवर् ब�क म� बदलवाना)  For ₹ 500 & 1000 SBN-notes, soil rate was much lower than the currency notes of ₹ 10 to 100. (implying that 500-1000 SBN were used for ‘storing black money’, rather than in transactions.)  So, experts made mathematical comparison of the foreign countries’ economic development, soil rates of their foreign currency notes etc. and arrived at a figure ₹ 3 lakh crores of Indian black money is stored in SBN (=2% of GDP).  So if SBN were demonetised, the black money holders will not return their currency notes into banks (fearing IT-RAIDS) and thus black money will be destroyed. (काला धन �यं तबाह हो जाएगा)  But in reality, ~99.30% of the SBN were returned back into the banking system, so hardly ₹ 10,720 crore of black money was destroyed by the demonetisation of 2016. 24.11.2 � Demonetisation SC Verdict - 2016: Congress Leader P Chidambaram and many others had petitioned in SC. - 2023: Supreme Court upholds Demonetisation In 4:1 Verdict.
