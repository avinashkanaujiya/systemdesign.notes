Syllabus: Population related issues/ Development and management of social sectors or service Context: The next 25 years could be the golden years for the country, provided it makes the best use of its favourable demographic composition. Demographic dividend: It is the economic growth po- tential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population is larger than the non-working-age share of the population. (UNFPA) India’s demographic dividend: ● India’s average age is 29 years, whereas the av- erage age in US, China, France, Germany and Ja- pan is 38, 38, 42, 45 and 48 years, respectively. ● Therefore, India is the youngest among the most populous countries in the world. Implications: ● India is now in a phase in which its working-age population is rising and the old-age dependen- cy ratio is coming down. ● For example, India’s old-age dependency ratio will reach 37% in 2075, whereas the same will be 56% in France, 75% in Japan, 49% in the US, etc. Success stories: ● Most developed countries today have been able to make use of their phase of favourable demo- graphics for higher growth and standard of liv- ing. ● China has already set an example of being a su- perpower by harnessing its demographic divi- dend from the early Eighties till 2008-2009. ● Similarly, Japan (between the mid-50s and late 80s), South Korea (from the early 90s till 2015), Malaysia and Singapore have shown consistent growth by engineering structural transforma- tions to utilise their demographic dividend. What’s behind China’s success? China’s early focus on labour-intensive manufacturing and subsequent struc- www.insightsonindia.com3 tural transformation resulted in an almost 10% annual average growth rate over four decades, which is un- precedented. Opportunities for India: Most countries are experienc- ing record low fertility rates (6.77 births per 1,000 peo- ple in China) and a shrinking labour force. What should India do? ● Focus on quality education and health facili- ties, skilling, reskilling and up-skilling of the la- bour force to make them more productive and efficient. ● Create opportunities for the existing labour force and the new entrants into the labour mar- ket by improving their productivity. ● Shift a major chunk of the 45.5% of the labour force engaged in agriculture with low and negli- gible labour productivity. ● Focus on labour-intensive manufacturing such as textiles, toys, footwear, auto components, sports goods and agricultural processing, as most of the labour force has limited education and skill sets. ● Reap the benefits of sectors (like restaurants, hotels, mining and construction, healthcare and caregiving services) with huge potential. ● For the manufacturing sector to grow, India needs an accelerated focus on - ○ Infrastructure development to reduce trade and transaction costs, ○ Trade facilitation measures, ○ A better IPR ecosystem, ○ Ease of doing business on the ground, and ○ Further rationalisation of labour laws and the taxation system. ○ MSMEs - the backbone of Indian man- ufacturing, need support in improving competitiveness, achieving scale, digital infrastructure, technology up-grade and branding to be part of a larger supply chain and the global value chains. Steps taken: ● Skill development programmes such as the Jan Shikshan Sansthan, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme are welcome steps. ○ They have increased human resources supply in various sectors during 2017- 22. ● The Vision 2025 (of the MSDE) aims to improve linkages between education and skill, catalyse demand for formal skills and create a high- skilled ecosystem. ● Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat Mission and PM Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana have en- sured health equity to a great extent. ● The National Education Policy 2020 gives im- portance to updating knowledge, ensuring pro- ductive employment opportunities and decent/ dignified work as listed in the UN SDGs 2030. ● Samagra Shiksha programme provides inclu- sive, equitable and quality education at all levels of school education. Challenges: ● 93% of the employment in India is absorbed by the unorganised sector, where workers are em- ployed in underpaid jobs. ● High out-of-pocket expenditure on health- care, poor quality of education, non-functional schools, reluctant authorities, etc. Way ahead: ● Improve the labour force participation by im- proving the employability of the labour force through large-scale skilling. ● At the same time, creating employment oppor- tunities for the youth who enter the job market every year. ● Scale up access and quality health services for the majority of the population. ● Delivery of quality education up to higher sec- ondary education to all is imperative for making a productive labour force. Conclusion: India’s biggest strength is its manpower. India can be the source of the labour force for the rest of the world, provided that it accelerates reforms and achieves the desired results of flagship programmes of Skill India, Make in India, Start-up India, etc. Insta Links: India as most populous can be more boon than bane GS Paper 2 SARPANCH PATI Syllabus: Governance Context: The Supreme Court of India has stated that www.insightsonindia.com4 the issue of men wielding power behind elected wom- en in grassroots politics (also called as sarpanch Pati) should be addressed by the government and not the judiciary. •\t The court advised an NGO, to make a represen- tation before the Ministry of Panchayati Raj re- garding this matter. •\t The NGO argued that unelected male relatives exerting political and decision-making power behind elected women is a mockery of con- stitutional democracy, despite the one-third quota for women in panchayat governance in- troduced by the Seventy-Third Constitution Amendment Act in 1992. About Sarpanch Pati: The phenomenon of sarpanch Pati or husbands who wield control in panchayats by making their wives contest is neither new nor rare. Even the Prime Minis- ter has taken cognizance of the problem and identified it as a hurdle to women’s progress. Examples: •\t In a case in Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, a man even had a ‘power of attorney’ document which gave him the right to take decisions in place of the elected woman sarpanch whose election expenses he had purportedly paid for. •\t A woman sarpanch from Odisha also ‘autho- rised’ her husband to carry out her duties as sarpanch saying that she did not do it under pressure but citing domestic responsibilities. Reasons behind the practice of Sarpanch Pati: •\t Patriarchal gender norms •\t Lack of capacity building and training for wom- en to take leadership roles in local government. •\t Poor social status of a woman with high levels of illiteracy. •\t Absence of strong deterrence laws to punish men. •\t Absence of recognition of women and their contributions.

Syllabus: Economy Context: According to the RBI, with India remaining one of the fastest-growing countries and showing remark- able resilience in the face of major headwinds, the ru- pee has the potential to become an internationalised currency. What does internationalisation of the rupee mean? ● Internationalisation is a process that involves increasing the use of the rupee in cross-border transactions - between residents in India and non-residents. ● It involves promoting the rupee for import and export trade and then other current account transactions, followed by its use in capital ac- count transactions. ● Currently, the US dollar, the Euro, the Japanese yen and the pound sterling are the leading re- serve currencies in the world. ● China’s efforts to make its currency renminbi has met with only limited success so far. Prerequisites: The internationalisation of the currency, which is closely interlinked with the - ● Nation’s economic progress. ● Further opening up of the currency settlement and a strong swap and forex market. ● Full convertibility of the currency on the capital account (allowing free movement of local finan- cial investment assets into foreign assets and vice-versa) and ● Cross-border transfer of funds without any re- strictions. Current scenario: ● India has allowed only full convertibility on the current account as of now. ● The US dollar is said to enjoy an ‘Exorbitant Priv- ilege’, supported by a range of factors, including the size of the US economy, a history of mac- roeconomic stability and currency convertibility, lack of viable alternatives, etc. ● Chinese Renminbi is the obvious challenger to the US dollar dominance. However, its ability to rival the US dollar will depend on the - www.insightsonindia.com5 ○ Chinese economy and its financial sys- tem to demonstrate the same long-term resilience, ○ Integrity, transparency, openness and stability, which are characteristics of the US economy. The RBI recommendations: Short term Long term Adoption of a stan- dardised approach for examining the proposals on bilateral and multilat- eral trade arrangements The inclusion of the ru- pee in IMF’s SDR (special drawing rights) The SDR is an internation- al reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement the official reserves of its member countries. The value of the SDR is based on a basket of five currencies - the U.S. dol- lar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling. Encouraging the opening of the rupee accounts for non-residents both in India and outside India Integrating Indian pay- ment systems with other countries for cross-bor- der transactions Strengthening the finan- cial market by fostering a global 24×5 rupee mar- ket and recalibration of the FPI (foreign portfolio investor) regime A review of taxes on ma- sala (rupee-denominat- ed bonds issued outside India by Indian entities) bonds, international use of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) for cross-border trade trans- actions and inclusion of Indian Government Bonds in global bond in- dices These recommendations are significant: ● In light of the economic sanctions imposed by the US on Russia for invading Ukraine and the growing clamour for finding an alternative to the US dollar for international transactions. ● While reserves help manage exchange rate vola- tility and project external stability, they impose a cost on the economy. Advantages of internationalisation of the rupee: ● Cross-border transactions mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses by protecting them from currency volatility. This will - ○ Reduce the cost of doing business and improve the chances for Indian busi- nesses to grow globally. ○ Add weight to the Indian economy and enhance India’s global stature and re- spect. ● Internationalisation of the rupee reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves. ● Reducing dependence on foreign currency will make India less vulnerable to external shocks. Challenges: ● Very little international demand: The daily av- erage share for the rupee in the global foreign exchange market is ~1.6%, while India’s share of global goods trade is ~2%. ● India does not permit full capital account con- vertibility: It is driven by past fears of capital flight (outflow of capital from India due to mon- etary policies/lack of growth) and exchange rate volatility, given significant current and capital account deficits. Reforms needed: ● Rupee must be made more freely convertible, with a goal of full convertibility by 2060. ● The RBI should pursue a deeper and more liq- uid rupee bond market, enabling foreign inves- tors and Indian trade partners to have more in- vestment options in rupees. ● Indian exporters and importers should be en- couraged to invoice their transactions in rupee. ● Currency swap agreements (as with Sri Lanka) would further allow India to settle trade and in- vestment transactions. ● Tax incentives to foreign businesses to utilise the rupee in operations in India would also help. ● The Tarapore Committees’ (in 1997 and 2006) recommendations must be pursued including - ○ A push to reduce fiscal deficits lower than 3.5%, ○ A reduction in gross inflation rate to 3%- 5%, and ○ A reduction in gross banking non-per- forming assets to less than 5%.

Facts For Prelims ZO PEOPLES OF MANIPUR & MIZORAM Context: The recent clashes in Manipur has raised at- tention of many leaders who called for a reunification of the Zo people in view of the continuing ethnic vi- olence between the dominant Meiteis and the Ku- ki-Zomi tribes in the neighbouring state. About Zo tribes: •\t The Zo people comprise various tribes, includ- ing Chin, Kuki, Mizo, Lushei, Zomi, and others, spread across Myanmar, India, and Bangla- desh. The tribes share a common history, in- cluding migration and settlements in different regions, and are connected by their Christian faith. •\t The movement for Zo reunification, while emo- tionally appealing to the people of Mizoram, faces political challenges in terms of carving out areas from Manipur, Tripura, and neighbouring countries for integration with Mizoram. CHATBOT FOR PEOPLE IN MEN- TAL DISTRESS Context: India’s first Tele-MANAS chatbot, designed to engage with people in distress, has been launched in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). •\t The initiative aims to provide round-the-clock access to health counsellors, clinical psychol- ogists, and consultants. The launch took place during the J&K Health Conclave on Mental Health and Non-Communicable Diseases. Under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Tele- MANAS is a two-tier system. •\t Tier 1 comprises State Tele MANAS cells, which includes trained counsellors and mental health specialists. •\t Tier 2 comprises specialists at District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)/Medical College resources for physical consultation and/or eS- anjeevani for audio visual consultation. FARMERS DISTRESS INDEX Context: The Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) in India has developed a unique early warning system known as the “farmers’ distress index.” Significance of the index: •\t The purpose of this index is to minimize agrari- an distress, including crop loss, failure, and in- come shocks, which have led to an increase in farmer suicides. •\t The index’s methodology involves monitoring local newspapers, news platforms, and so- cial media for reports of distress, followed by telephonic interviews with small and marginal farmers to assess early signs of distress using standardized questions. •\t The index allows for targeted interventions, such as focusing on improving women’s in- comes if the distress is gender-based. NEW METHANE SOURCE Context: Climate change is causing groundwater springs to release methane in the Arctic as retreating glaciers expose these methane-rich springs, according to a study published in Nature Geoscience. •\t The groundwater springs found in Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic, could be emitting over 2,000 tonnes of methane annually, which is equivalent to 10% of Norway’s methane emis- sions from its oil and gas industry. •\t The presence of methane near shale rocks sug- gests a geologic or thermogenic source of gas that moves upward through fractures in the rocks and accumulates beneath the glacier. As global warming continues and glaciers retreat fur- ther, the release of methane from glacial groundwater springs is expected to increase, highlighting the need to assess the risk and impact of these emissions. MICROPLASTICS Context: A report by the Food and Agriculture Organi- zation (FAO) highlights the significant impact of micro- plastics and nano plastics on human and animal gut microbiomes and the environment. www.insightsonindia.com7 Findings: •\t Exposure to plastic has been observed to cause intestinal inflammation and gut dysbiosis, al- tering the gut microbiome and microbiota. •\t Microplastics and nano plastics are known to affect soil microorganisms and can enter the food chain. Evidence suggests that these parti- cles have been found in human lung tissue, pla- centa, stool, blood, and meconium. •\t Most studies in the report indicate alterations in the host due to microplastic exposure, in- cluding changes in gene markers, biochemical markers, mucus layer, gut permeability, oxida- tive stress, immune response, and liver func- tion. About Microplastics: Microplastics are plastic particles less than 5mm in diameter. They are of two types, •\t Primary Microplastics: They are tiny parti- cles designed for commercial use and micro- fibers shed from clothing and other textiles. E.g., microbeads found in personal care prod- ucts, plastic pellets and plastic fibres. •\t Secondary Microplastics: They are formed from the breakdown of larger plastics such as water bottles.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
