S. House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) : It recommended strengthening the ‘NA T O-Plus’ framework by including India in the grouping INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context North Atlantic T reaty Organization (NA T O): 2 /4 Headquarters: Brussels, Belgium. It is a military alliance established by the North Atlantic T reaty (also called the W ashington T reaty) of April, 1949, by the United States, Canada, and several W estern European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. There are currently 30 member states(Finland 31st). NA T O’ s essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. NA T O has an integrated military command s tructure but very few forces or assets are exclusively its own. Other Countries who recently Joined NA T O before Norway (1949) Latvia (2004) Estonia (2004) Poland (1999) Lithuania (2004) Finland(2023) NA T O Plus : It refers to a security arrangement of NA T O a nd the five treaty allies of the U.S. — Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, and South Korea as members. 3 /4 Aim : To enhance “global defense cooperation” and win the “strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party”. NA T O Plus ’ is not an of ficially recognised or established concept within NA T O itself It has been used in discussions and debates regarding the potential expansion of the alliance. The inclusion of these countries as members would require a complex process of negotiation and assessment of their compatibility with NA T O’s principles, obligations, and defense commitments. The focus of NA T O Plus is on containing China. Therefore, considering its disputes with China , India remains a missing link in the framework. Advantages for India in joining NA T O Plus: In light of increasing regional security challenges, India joining the NA T O Plus framework could provide it with a security umbrella W ith protection and deterrence against potential threats. India could also gain access to advanced military technologies, intelligence- sharing platforms, and interoperability with other member-states. This could potentially strengthen India’ s defense capabilities a nd modernisation ef forts. Issues with Joining NA T O for India: Getting into any NA T O framework will annoy Russia and China. Apart from the robust strategic partnership, Russia has been useful to India in dealing with regional security challenges Russia has helped in moderating t he stance of China. Even though Russia is getting over-dependent on China, post the war in Ukraine, Russia remains a valuable partner for India. India’ s solidified strategic partnership with Russia will crumble. While aligning with the U.S.-led alliance system may be tempting due to the threats posed by China It could ultimately prove counterproductive and detrimental. Having a military framework will limit India’ s freedom of action and prevent it from pursuing an independent policy towards China. At a time when India has its own bilateral issues with China and a strategy for the Indo-Pacific, hopping into the T aiwan strategy of the U.S. under NA T O Plus will complicate India’ s security It will pave the way for the possibility of Chinese justification for further military build-up along the India-China border and frequent intrusion. India has traditionally maintained a policy of strategic autonomy , allowing it to engage with various nations and blocs based on its own interests. Joining a NA T O framework would require India to align its defense and security policies with the objectives and strategies of the alliance thereby potentially undermining India’ s autonomy . 4 /4 The non-aligned policy will become irrelevant. It could strain relationships with countries, especially neighbors and regional organizations that value India’ s independent stance It could limit its flexibility in engaging with other regional powers. W ay Forward India’ s priorities lie in addressing its own regional dynamics that includes a unique set of security challenges such as border disputes, terrorism, and regional conflicts. NA T O has certain competencies to deal with such issues , its larger geopolitical agenda starting from Eurasia to the Indo-Pacific may divert resources and attention away from these pressing issues and, therefore, will not be of much help to India. India’ s posturing through the Quad- the Asian NA T O as per China: It looks more promising than the NA T O Plus bait, though China remains an elephant in the room during its summits. QUESTION FOR PRACTICE 1 . What introduces friction into the ties between India and the United States is that W ashington is still unable to find for India a position in its global strategy , which would satisfy India’ s National self- esteem and ambitions” Explain with suitable examples.(UPSC 2019) (200 WORDS, 10 MARKS)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
