The Govt would start raising a part of its borrowing programme in external markets in external currencies.\" 🙂🙂Arguments in favor (समथर्न) 😥😥Against (प्र�ाव के �व�द्ध) 1. In domestic market, the 'crowding out of private corporate borrowers' will decline. (������ more in 2D:Fiscal Deficit) 2. Corporates will be able to mobilize more funds from local market → factory expansion, jobs, GDP growth�� 3. In the advanced economies such as USA, EU: the loan interest rates are very low, so our Indian govt may be able to get cheaper loans. स�े �ाज पर 1. Exchange Rate Risk (�व�नमय दर का जो�खम): If rupee weakens against the dollar during the bond’s tenure ($1: ₹ 60 → ₹ 70), the government would have to return more rupees to pay back the same amount of dollars. Then the loan may turn out to be 'more expensive' than originally anticipated. 2. It's true that presently Indian Govt's external borrowing is very low, but once this 'door' is opened, subsequent govts may get tempted to borrow more and more from the foreign sources to finance their (populist) welfare schemes, ultimately it can result into crisis when rupee gets weaker. लोकलुभावन योजनाओं के �लए �वदेशी ऋण लेने क� सरकार को लत लग सकती है (Batch:PCB9-RAFTAAR) Mrunal’s Economy Pillar#2D: Budget → Disinvestment & Deficits → Page 366 🙂🙂Arguments in favor (समथर्न) 😥😥Against (प्र�ाव के �व�द्ध) 4.

Conclusion: whether we should borrow in foreign currency or not? ⇒ �� (Against) From the aforementioned analysis, it's evident that challenges outweigh the potential benefits. Noted economists such as Dr. Raghuram Rajan are apprehensive about sovereign borrowing from external markets in foreign currency.

Thus, this scheme will self- destruct after deadline just like the sun will set after the sunset. 28.5 👜👜 GENDER BUDGET (ल��गक बजट) Not required in Constitution / any law. But within general budget, this data presented since 2005. 28.6 💼💼💼💼💼💼 TRIBAL SUB PLAN & SCSP From 70s, Govt required individual ministries to earmark funds for SC/ST within their overall funds: A. “Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP: अनुसू�चत जा�त उप-योजना)” → Social Justice Ministry monitors via e-utthaan.gov.in B. “Tribal Sub plan (TSP: आ�दवासी उप योजना)” → Tribal Affairs Ministry monitors via stcmis.gov.in which is not a fancy name so we need not memorize unlike e-utthaan. Sidenote: Although not required by the Constitution, but Government also tables separate documents showing 1) allocation for children 2) allocation for NORTH EASTERN AREAs. 28.7 💼💼💼💼💼💼 OUTPUT OUTCOME FRAMEWORK FOR SCHEMES: (Batch:PCB9-RAFTAAR) Mrunal’s Economy Pillar#2D: Budget → Disinvestment & Deficits → Page 402 योजनाओं के �लए उ�ादन प�रणाम ढाँचा Started from Budget-2017 onwards, the FinMin uploads a document showing outlay output and outcomes for each ministry and department.

I am deleting it from latest handout. 28.9 💼💼 📤📤💼💼 LAPSABLE FUNDS & MARCH RUSH: �पगत �न�ध और माचर् ��ता Appropriation act allows the government to spend funds from consolidated fund of India for a period of one year (ending in 31st March). - If any allotted funds remain unutilised, then by the ‘ rule of lapse ’, they must be returned (& govt will have to again seek Parliament approval for the next financial year using next appropriation bill). So, in March, there is a rush among the Govt orgs to spend money (in a haphazard / reckless manner) lest they’ve to return it back. - 2017-18: Finance ministry issued directive that in “In the fourth quarter (Jan to March) and in the March-Month, Govt organizations shall not spend more than “x%” & “y%” of funds”. This helps controlling the March Rush. 28.10 💼💼 📤📤💼💼 NON LAPSABLE FUNDS & NO RUSH: �बन�पगत �नधी The money in such fund will not lapse on 31st March, so it can be used in future without getting another approval from parliament. e.g. Dept of Economic Affairs → Nirbhaya fund → women safety related projects. - 😰😰 Criticism? Since fund is non lapsable, Departments become very lax in utilising it. Budget 2013 started Nirbhaya fund in the aftermath of Dec-2012 Gangrape @Delhi. The successive budgets kept adding ₹ into it. By 2018: ~3000 crore but not even 50% utilized - 2018: Defence ministry demands “ non lapsable defence modernization fund”, but Finance ministry rejected for similar same reason. (money will remain unspent.) Although later 15 th FC has recommended Modernisation Fund for Defence and Internal Security (MFDIS) ₹ 2.38 Lcr (total for 2021-26).
