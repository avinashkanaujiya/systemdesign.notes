What are Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)? ● An MDB is an international financial institution con- sisting of member nations from developed and de- veloping countries. ● MDBs provide loans and grants to member (espe- cially poor/ developing) nations to fund projects that support their social and economic develop- ment. The emergence of MDBs: ● At the end of WWII, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods (US) to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and recon- struction. ● This led to the creation of the IMF and World Bank Group (WBG) in 1944. ● The WB was responsible for providing financial as- sistance for the post-war reconstruction and eco- nomic development of the less developed countries. ● While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB, there are ~15-16 prominent MDBs and Regional de- velopment banks (RDBs) today. The role played by MDGs: ● MDBs have a key role to support the needed reforms and resources. ● They work with governments and the private sec- tor to create the conditions for investment and transformation. ● They are the most effective institutions to provide low-cost, long-maturity financing, to mitigate and share risks (in the most efficient way) faced by pri- vate investors. Challenges faced by MDBs: ● No longer suited to address the emerging glob- al challenges: They lack resources, cultural ethos, methods and will to address the challenges like cli- mate change and pandemics. ● They are in a state of stagnation: Trapped in their procedures, approach and methods of work and re- www.insightsonindia.com3 sistant to structural changes. ● Therefore, to transform development, the MDBs will have to transform themselves. Recommendations of the IEG report - Triple agenda to har- ness the potential of MDBs: The three elements of this agenda are: ● Adopting a triple mandate of eliminating extreme poverty, boosting shared prosperity, and contribut- ing to global public goods; ● Tripling sustainable lending levels by 2030; and ● Creating a third funding mechanism which would permit flexible and innovative arrangements for pur- posefully engaging with investors willing to support elements of the MDB agenda. How can it be achieved? ● Effective implementation of the triple agenda re- quires important changes in the ways that MDBs operate. ● MDBs must become effective agents in all develop- ing countries for integrating development and cli- mate agendas. ● They must work with governments and the private sector to reduce, share and manage risks and there- by bring down the cost of capital. ● They must change their culture, become more cli- ent-responsive, and take more risks. ● Timelines for project preparation should be shrunk and procedures rationalised. ● They must also increase the scale and nature of their activities. Way ahead: ● One of the greatest opportunities for transformation is in MDB’s engagement with the private sector. ● The MDB system must become more than the sum of its individual entities. Their strength has come from heterogeneity, which permits innovations in different parts of the system. Conclusion: While the reform agenda needs to be decisively put on track, there is a need for an independent monitoring group to encourage the full implementation of recommen- dations and report to G20 on progress. Insta Links: Reforming Multilateral Development Banks Mains Links: Q. The World Bank and the IMF, collectively known as the Bretton Woods Institutions, are the two inter-governmen- tal pillars supporting the structure of the world’s economic and financial order. Superficially, the World Bank and the IMF exhibit many common characteristics, yet their role, functions and mandate are distinctly different. Elucidate (UPSC 2013) GS Paper 2 FACILITATING INVESTMENT IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOP- MENT GOALS Syllabus: Government Policies and Investment Context: The UNCTAD released a new publication - “Facilitat- ing Investment in the Sustainable Development Goals”. About the publication: It is part of UNCTAD’s investment advisory series, which provides practical advice and case studies of best policy practices for attracting FDI that con- tribute to sustainable development. Highlights of the publication: ● To shore up funding for the UN SDGs, countries need more proactive and tailored services for inves- tors. ● An estimated $4 trillion is required in developing countries annually to achieve the SDGs. This can be made possible through foreign investment. ● The role of the investment promotion agencies (IPAs) can be significant, as they are the focal point for government-wide efforts to facilitate foreign in- vestment. www.insightsonindia.com4 Investment promotion vs facilitation: ● Investment promotion is meant to attract potential investors that have not yet selected an investment destination. ● Whereas facilitation starts at the pre-establishment phase when an investor shows interest in a loca- tion. Why does investment facilitation matter? ● Investment facilitation aims at making it easier for investors to establish and expand their investments, as well as conduct their day-to-day business in host countries. ● This can happen by providing relevant information, making rules and regulations more transparent and streamlining administrative procedures for inves- tors. How can IPAs bolster SDG implementation through invest- ment facilitation? ● By ensuring that investment facilitation services are inclusive. This will address the specific needs and opportunities of SDG-related sectors, and specific investor groups. ● When establishing a project, IPAs can assist in filling in the information gap by pointing investors to po- tential partners and incentive programmes. ● They can forge new partnerships with local govern- ments and national ministries dealing with SDG-re- lated investment opportunities. ● To stay competitive in a digitalised economy post- COVID-19, IPAs have increasingly turned to digital platforms to conduct many of their promotional and facilitation services. Challenges: ● While sustainable investment continues to grow, such financing remains heavily concentrated in the world’s richest economies. ● Most of it goes to sectors related to climate change adaptation (renewable energy), and far less towards sectors such as health, education, water and sanita- tion. Way ahead: ● Developing SDG project pipelines by prioritising sectors where funding is needed the most. ● Defining related targets and preparing relevant in- vestment project profiles. ● There is a need for stronger knowledge manage- ment of insights and lessons learned on SDG invest- ment. Best practice - Invest India: ● The IPA has an online Industrial Land Bank that showcases all available land in several subregions that can be used for development. ● The agency is in the process of aggregating the tool at the national level. Conclusion: Investment is particularly important for SDGs-re- lated investment, which often requires more proactive and more tailored services for investors than traditional invest- ment.

Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar nominated four women parliamentarians, making up half of the eight-mem- ber panel. Among the newly nominated members is S. Phangnon Konyak (She is the first woman to be elected as a Member of the Rajya Sabha from Nagaland in April 2022 and the second woman from the State to be elected to ei- ther House of the Parliament or the State Assembly.) What is a Panel of Vice-Chairpersons? The Panel of Vice-Chairpersons in Rajya Sabha is headed by the Deputy Chairman. The members are nominated from the members of the Rajya Sabha by the Chairperson. Its role is to assist in passing bills and ensuring the effective func- tioning of the government. In case of the Chairman’s absence, the same duty is delegat- ed and executed by the deputy chairman of the house. www.insightsonindia.com5 RULE 267 VS RULE 176 OF THE RA- JYA SABHA Context: Monsoon Session’s opening was disrupted due to disagreement on the Manipur discussion format. Govt agreed to a short-duration discussion (under Rule 176), but the Opposition demanded the PM’s suo motu statement fol- lowed by a discussion under Rule 267. Rule Rule 267 Rule 176 Purpose To suspend any rule’s application related to the day’s listed business and discuss an urgent issue of public impor- tance. To allow for a short-duration dis- cussion not exceed- ing two-and-a-half hours on a matter of urgent public im- portance. Process An Opposition member can give notice under Rule 267, requesting the suspension of all listed businesses for the day to discuss the urgent matter. If the Chairman consents and the mo- tion is carried, the Ra- jya Sabha can suspend regular business and de- vote time to address the pressing issue. A member can give notice in writing to the Secretary-Gen- eral, supported by the signatures of at least two other members, stating the specific matter they wish to raise. The Chairman, in consultation with the Leader of the Council, will then fix a date and time for the short-dura- tion discussion. Format The discussion can sus- pend all listed business- es, allowing time for in- depth debate. The discussion is time-bound and limited to two-and- a-half hours. Voting No formal motion or voting is required. No formal motion or voting is re- quired. Examples Discussing the Manipur situation and other ur- gent matters of public importance. Discussing the ris- ing prices of essen- tial commodities, border issues with China, etc. Recent controversy: The Opposition has expressed concern that none of their notices under Rule 267 are being taken up, even though previous Rajya Sabha Chairmen have allowed such discussions on various subjects. INDIA HAS A 3–5-YEAR CHINA+1 WINDOW Context: World Bank President stated that India has shown resilience and emerged stronger from the pandemic com- pared to other countries. He expressed optimism, as the country’s focus on growth and job creation is crucial in re- ducing poverty. •\t Highlighted the “China+1” opportunity, where com- panies seek alternative manufacturing sites to di- versify supply chains post-Covid and emphasized that India has a three-to-five-year window to capi- talize on this opportunity. India’s advantage lies in its significant percentage of GDP coming from local production, which cushions the impact of global slowdowns caused by trade disruptions. Key suggestions given: •\t Private capital investments to support global efforts for renewable energy funding, estimating that de- veloping nations will need $1 trillion for the green energy transition. •\t The importance of concessional capital, multilater- al bank capital, and philanthropy capital to enable blended finance. NATO SUMMIT The recent NATO summit held in Vilnius had several key takeaways: •\t Ukraine’s Presence: The launch of the NATO-Ukraine Council aimed to engage and support Ukraine. •\t New Members: Finland and Sweden’s approval as NATO members showcased the alliance’s commit- ment to expansion and deterrence against potential threats, including Russia. •\t U.S. Support: U.S. President Joe Biden reaffirmed unwavering support for NATO and Ukraine, contrast- ing with former President Donald Trump’s stance on the alliance. •\t China’s Threat: The summit addressed China’s ma- licious cyber operations, confrontational rhetoric, and disinformation, recognizing its emerging chal- lenges to Euro-Atlantic security. •\t Russia’s Contestation: While the summit discussed potential expansion, Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv, highlighting the ongoing security contesta- tion in Eurasia. About NATO: www.insightsonindia.com6 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (founded: 1949; HQ: Brussels, Belgium), also called the North Atlantic Alli- ance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between 31 member states (including Finland)– 29 European and two North American. F o u n d i n g Members Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether- lands, Norway, Portugal, the United King- dom, and the United States Article 5 A key provision of the NATO treaty states that an attack on one member is an at- tack on all members.

Alliances Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), Mediterranean Dialogue, Istanbul Coop- eration Initiative (ICI) Note: Sweden is yet to be included in NATO. CREDIT GUARANTEE SCHEME FOR LIVESTOCK SECTOR Context: The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying has launched the “Credit Guarantee Scheme” un- der the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) to support the rural economy by leveraging Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Live- stock sector. What is Credit Guarantee Fund? The Credit Guarantee Fund is a financial mechanism that provides risk mitigation for lending institutions, by lending to individuals or businesses, even without sufficient collat- eral. If the borrower defaults, the fund reimburses the lend- ing institution for the guaranteed portion of the loan. The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust, established in March 2021, is India’s first-ever fund trust under the Credit Guaran- tee Scheme for the agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. It aims to significantly increase the number of MSMEs bene- fiting from the AHIDF scheme and strengthen the ecosystem for collateral-free credit from banks. Features of the Scheme: Under the scheme, the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying has established a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust of Rs. 750.00 crores (under NABARD), which provides credit guarantee coverage of up to 25% for credit facilities extend- ed to MSMEs by eligible lending institutions. Advantages: This initiative aims to improve access to finance for under- served livestock entrepreneurs, especially first-generation and underprivileged individuals who lack collateral security. About AHIDF It is a Central Sector Scheme launched by the Ministry of An- imal Husbandry, Fisheries, and Dairying. Its aim is to encour- age investments in dairy and meat processing infrastructure, as well as animal feed plants. INVEST INDIA Context: Ms Nivruti Rai has been appointed as the Managing Director & CEO of Invest India. Ms Rai, a recipient of the prestigious Nari Shakti Puraskar, brings a wealth of experience from her 29-year tenure at In- tel, where she led Intel India as Country Head for the past seven years. Invest India (est. 2009), is a non-profit venture under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. It serves as the national investment promotion and facilita- tion agency, targeting specific sectors and fostering partner- ships for sustainable investments in India. I BIOFORTIFIED FOODS Context: The Indian industry aims to create separate brand- ing for biofortified foods, similar to “organic” products, to enhance their popularity. •\t To promote access to nutrient-rich crops, the gov- ernment is seeking the assistance of the private sector. About Biofortification: •\t Biofortification is a process of enhancing the nutri- tional content of crops by increasing the levels of essential vitamins and minerals. •\t It is a targeted approach to address nutrient de- ficiencies in populations, particularly in regions where people have limited access to diverse and nutritious diets. www.insightsonindia.com7 The main objective of biofortification is to improve the nu- tritional status of vulnerable populations, especially in de- veloping countries where malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent. By enhancing the nutrient con- tent of staple crops, such as rice, wheat, maize, and beans, biofortification aims to provide a sustainable and cost-effec- tive solution to combat malnutrition and related health is- sues. FOSSIL SHOWS A PUGNACIOUS MAMMAL ATTACKING A DINO- SAUR Context: A remarkable fossil discovered in north-eastern China sheds light on the complex interactions between mammals and dinosaurs during the Mesozoic Era, around 125 million years ago. •\t The fossil shows a small badger-like mammal called Repenomamus robustus attacking a medium-sized, plant-eating dinosaur named Psittacosaurus lujia- tunensis. •\t The fossil provides evidence of a smaller mammal preying on a larger dinosaur, challenging the tra- ditional belief that dinosaurs always ate smaller mammals. The discovery suggests that Mesozoic food webs were more complex than previously thought, with some mammals being active predators rather than just prey. This find also challenges the idea that mammals only scavenged dinosaur carcasses. The interaction between Repenomamus and Psit- tacosaurus is a unique example of a mammal preying on a dinosaur. Mapping SURAT Context: The Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) is claimed to be the world’s largest office space in a single project, with an area of 66 lakh square feet. The main objective of the SDB is to expand and shift the diamond trading business from Mumbai to Surat, the hub of diamond cutting and polishing, and to provide all diamond-related activities and infrastruc- ture under one roof. Surat is the world’s biggest centre for cutting and polishing, accounting for 90% of the diamonds traded globally.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
