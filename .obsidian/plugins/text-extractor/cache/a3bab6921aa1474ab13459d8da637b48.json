Nepal 2 /1 7 Climate change and mountains of the northern hemisphere GS Paper 1/3 Syllabus: Geomorphology/Climate/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation Source: DTE Context: According to a new study , a rise in temperature due to climate change could cause a shift in snowfall to rainfall in mountain regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Findings of the study: The mountains across the Northern Hemisphere are likely to see 15% more rain for every 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature due to climate change. For 2 degrees and 3 degrees rise , the world would see a 30 and 45% increase in rain, respectively . Most vulnerable: The Himalayas and the North American Pacific Mountain ranges , including the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and coastal ranges from Canada to Southern California are more threatened than the Rockies or the Alps. The Himalayas is one of those hotspot regions where an increased risk (due to changes in atmospheric dynamics) of rainfall extremes is witnessed. Impact: A change in air temperature will shift snowfall in these regions to rainfall and could increase the risk of disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion . 26% of the global population living in or directly downstream of these mountainous regions is going to be directly af fected by this risk. Concerns raised in the W ater, Ice, Society , and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya ( HI-WISE ) report: The ICIMOD report found that the Hindu Kush Himalayas have seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass. W ater availability in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra is set to increase (through 2050) in the short term and decrease in the long term (~80% by 2100). Climate change is severely af fecting biodiversity in HKH . For example, the habitat of Himalayan ibex is likely to reduce by 33 to 64%. W ay ahead: Developing mountain-specific climate adaptation plans to protect the natural and built environments. Insta Links: 3 /1 7 ICIMOD Report: W ater, ice, society , and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya National Research Foundation (NRF) GS Paper 2 Syllabus: Statutory Bodies/Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services Relating to Education Source: PIB Context: The Union Cabinet, chaired by the PM of India, approved the National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill 2023, to give the nation’ s scientific research a strategic direction. Highlights of the Bill: It will establish NRF and repeal the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) – subsuming it into the NRF . SERB is a statutory body under the Department of Science and T echnology (DST) established in 2009 (by the SERB Act, 2008). It was set up for promoting basic research in science and engineering and to provide financial assistance to scientists, academic institutions, R&D laboratories, S&T start-ups, etc. National Research Foundation (NRF) About NRF will be established as an apex body at a total estimated cost of ₹ 50,000 crores from 2023-28 (the government will contribute ₹ 10,000 crores and ~ ₹ 36,000 crores are expected to come from the private sector as investments). Recommendation National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 Administrative department DST, Ministry of S&T Governed by A Governing Board: The PM will be the ex-officio President of the Board and the Union Minister of S&T and Union Minister of Education will be the ex-of ficio V ice-Presidents. It will also consist of eminent researchers and professionals across disciplines. An Executive Council: Chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India. Purpose NRF will seed, grow and promote R&D and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout India’ s universities, colleges, research institutions and R&D laboratories. 4 /1 7How? By prioritising research funding and ensuring that scientific research was conducted and funded equitably with greater participation from the private sector . Currently , the IITs and IISc receive the majority of research funds, whereas State universities receive a very little portion (~10%). By forging collaborations among the industry , academia, and government departments and research institutions and creating an interface mechanism for their participation and contribution. By creating a policy framework and putting in place regulatory processes that can encourage collaboration and increased spending by the industry on R&D. Significance/need of NRF/Bill India barely spends 0.7% of its GDP on R&D , which is extremely low compared to the US (2.83%), China (2.14%), Israel (4.9%), Brazil, Malaysia and Egypt. NRF will promote the democratisation of science funding, finding solutions to the big problems facing Indian society , etc. The Bill was necessary because current laws made it hard for private research organisations to contribute to a funding body such as the NRF . Insta Links: R&D ecosystem in India Mains Links: Scientific research in Indian universities is declining, because a career in science is not as attractive as our business operations, engineering or administration, and the universities are becoming consumer-oriented. Critically comment. (UPSC 2014) Global Forest W atch GS Paper 3 Syllabus: Environment Conservation Source: TH Context: A study quoted by the W orld Resources Institute’ s Global Forest W atch reveals that tropical areas experienced a significant decline in forest cover in 2022. Key findings: 5 /1 7 The loss amounted to 4. 1 million hectares , equivalent to an area the size of 1 1 football fields disappearing every minute . The primary forest cover loss in tropical regions was 10% higher in 2022 compared to the previous year . The study highlights that the world is not on track to meet its forest-related commitments: T wo key goals set by the W orld Resources Institute include ending deforestation by 2030 However , the global deforestation rate needs to decrease by at least 10% annually to meet the 2030 target. While deforestation rates reduced by 3.1% in 2022 compared to the 2018- 2020 baseline, they still exceeded the necessary levels by over one million hectares, indicating a deviation from the 2030 goal. Restoring 350 million hectares of lost and degraded forests by 2030 . The overall change in tree cover over the past two decades has been a net loss of 100 million hectares. This indicates that forests are still being lost instead of being restored at the required rate. Countries like Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo , with substantial tropical forest cover , experienced significant losses in 2022 . India : The study also highlights India’ s loss of 44 thousand hectares of humid primary forest between 2021 and 2022, accounting for 17% of the country’ s total tree cover loss during that period. What are Primary forests? Primary forests, also known as old-growth forests or virgin forests , are mature and undisturbed natural forests that have not experienced significant human intervention or alteration in recent history . These forests have reached a stage of ecological maturity and exhibit a complex and diverse ecosystem with fully developed tree canopy layers, understory vegetation, and rich biodiversity . Significance: They play a crucial role in storing carbon and supporting biodiversity . Once lost, the regrowth of secondary forests cannot match the ecological and carbon sequestration capabilities of primary forests. Global Forest W atch (launched 2014) is an open-source web application to monitor global forests in near real-time. GFW is an initiative of the W orld Resources Institute, with partners including Google, USAID, the University of Maryland, Esri, V izzuality and many other academic, non-profit, public, and private organizations.

About the Green Credit Programme (GCP): Under this, individuals, industries, FPOs, ULBs, gram panchayats and private sectors, etc., will be able to earn “green credit” for undertaking environment- friendly actions . The green credits will be tradable on a proposed domestic market platform. It follows the principle of LiFE – Lifestyle for Environment – to encourage sustainable lifestyles by driving consumers/communities towards behavioural changes to incentivise environment-friendly practices. The overall administration of the scheme: It will be under the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education – an autonomous organisation/ governmental agency under the MoEFCC. 8 sectors/activities that can qualify for generating credits: 7 /1 7 Sectors Purpose T ree plantation-based Green Credit To promote activities for increasing green cover across the country through tree plantation and related activities W ater-based Green Credit To promote water conservation, water harvesting and water use efficiency/savings, including treatment and reuse of wastewater Sustainable agriculture-based Green Credit To promote natural and regenerative agricultural practices and land restoration to improve productivity , soil health and nutritional value of food produced W aste management- based Green Credit To promote sustainable and improved practices for waste management, including collection, segregation and treatment Air pollution reduction-based Green Credit To promote measures for reducing air pollution and other pollution-abatement activities Mangrove conservation and restoration-based Green Credit To promote measures for the conservation and restoration of mangroves Ecomark-based Green Credit To encourage manufacturers to obtain an eco-mark label for their goods and services Sustainable building and infrastructure- based Green Credit To encourage the construction of buildings and other infrastructure using sustainable technologies and materials Objectives of GCP: To create a market-based (supply and demand) mechanism for incentivising voluntary environmental actions/ individual or community behaviour . T o encourage the private sector as well as other entities to meet their existing obligations, stemming from other legal frameworks. GCP vs carbon markets: Unlike carbon markets, where only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were traded, the GCP accounts for a wide range of actions and nowhere in the world such a wide range of actions are considered. Significance of the GCP: It’s a first-of-its-kind instrument that seeks to value and reward multiple ecosystem services to allow green projects to achieve optimal returns beyond just carbon. The scheme will allow project proponents to also access carbon markets additionally . 8 /1 7 Similar mechanisms elsewhere: In some countries (France, Germany and Sweden), social services generate credits – taking care of the elderly for a certain number of hours, for instance, gets one some credit that you can exchange in a salon. Concerns: The draft was a good statement of intent but its implementation would be extremely challenging. This is due to the dif ficulty in establishing the equivalence between various actions . For example, how much water one saved is equivalent to a tonne of CO2 prevented from emissions is dif ficult to establish. Monitoring, reporting and verification challenges. A strong risk of greenwashing – the appearance of doing a lot without actually achieving much beneficial impact. W ay ahead: Capacity needs to be built to monitor these systems and prevent fraud. It will save resources that could be diverted to more transformational pollution control and biodiversity protection ef forts.

Discuss the implications of these draft rules and their potential impact on promoting green initiatives and sustainability in the country . Examples of Ethics GS Paper 4 Syllabus: Application of ethics Source: TH , TH Example 1: V.K. Pandian , an influential bureaucrat and the private secretary to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has become a target of criticism from the opposition and certain factions within the BJD party . 9 /1 7 The complaint raised concerns about his u se of state transportation, public receptions, and announcements of new projects, suggesting a violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules. The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’ s visits resemble those of chief ministers and union ministers , blurring the line between a politician and a bureaucrat. Ethical Issues concerned: Ethical Issues Description V iolation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules Concerns about adherence to ethical standards are expected from government of ficials such as Anonymity . Blurring of Lines between Politicians and Bureaucrats The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’ s visits, similar to those of chief ministers and union ministers, raise ethical questions regarding the distinction between political and bureaucratic roles. Concentration of Power Ethical considerations related to accountability , transparency , and democratic principles. Favoritism and Nepotism The close association between Mr Pandian and the Chief Minister , as well as the allegations of him being a “gateway” to the Chief Minister , may raise ethical concerns related to favouritism, preferential treatment, and equitable distribution of opportunities and resources. Example 2: Discrimination in Cricket The England and W ales Cricket Board (ECB) has issued an apology following a report that revealed systemic discrimination within English cricket. The report, conducted by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), highlighted instances of racism, sexism, and class-based discrimination within the sport . The ECB expressed remorse for failing to prevent these forms of discrimination and acknowledged the need for significant change s. The report made 44 recommendations for reform, including equal pay for male and female international players by 2030 . Ethical values highlighted: Inclusivity , Equality , Anti-discrimination, Accountability , and Reform and improvement Example 3: ‘Selflessness’ in Public Life Cricketer Tendulkar reported on national duty after his father ’s death 1 0 /1 7 V irat Kohli played a match-saving knock for his team after his father ’s death Anil Kumble bowled with a broken Jaw (2002) against W est Indies. He said, “ At least I can now go home with the thought that I tried my best. All these examples highlight the importance of ” selflessness ” when it comes to ethics in public life/service. Example 4: Lessons on Emotional Intelligence in Cricket T est cricket, unlike most other sports, requires long-term , targeted behaviour and provides insights into how the mind experiences time, reward, threat, and anxiety . Understanding our ABCs (alarm-beliefs-coping) and managing our mind’ s reaction to time is crucial in cricket and life alike. Being emotionally intelligent helps players better their performance and reduce anxiety . V alues extracted: Self-awareness (recognizing and understanding one’ s own emotions) Self-regulation Building resilience to anxiety through cognitive reattribution training (CR T); Being flexible and adaptable in response to changing circumstances, and developing strategies to cope with anxiety and negative emotions Recognizing how anxiety can elongate the perception of time and impact sleep, diet, and emotional stability , and managing it ef fectively . Content for Mains Enrichment Meira Paibis Source: IE The Meira Paibis, also known as Imas or Mothers of Manipur , are Meitei women who represent a powerful moral force in Manipur . They come from all sections of society in the Imphal V alley and are widely respected . The Meira Paibis are known for their activism and have led various social and political movements in the state . They have been involved in protests against human rights violations, demanded the repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSP A), and supported causes such as the implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system . These women have a significant presence in Manipuri civil society and are recognized as society’ s conscience keepers. Usage : The example can be used in Indian Society , W omen related questions, Sociology and Governance questions. 1 1 /1 7 Socialism Source: T OI Context: The article discusses how socialist tendencies can have unintended consequences , concentrating wealth rather than spreading it and favouring inheritors over entrepreneurs. What is Socialism? Socialism is an economic and political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership and control of resources, means of production, and wealth distribution. It aims to create a more equitable society by reducing inequality , promoting social welfare , and ensuring that resources are allocated based on societal needs rather than individual profit. Issues: Countries with deep socialist roots, including France, Sweden, Russia, and India , are among those where the risk of protests against billionaires is high . This highlights the paradox that socialist-leaning countries can still experience a concentration of wealth and dissatisfaction with perceived inequality . Example: France is a country vulnerable to anti-rich populist revolts due to the rapid rise of billionaire wealth, particularly in family firms like L VMH . Recent protests in France targeted billionaires, including L VMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who has become a symbol of the perceived wealth disparity . Usage: The example can be used in Social Justice, Indian Society , PSIR and Sociology Paper UNODC W orld Drug Report 2023 Facts for PCrelims (FFP) Source: UNODC Context: The UNODC W orld Drug Report 2023 (a yearly report) highlights the expanding illicit drug markets and the challenges they pose to health service s and law enforcement. Key findings: Over 296 million people worldwide used drugs in 2021, a 23% increase over the past decade. 1 2 /1 7 The increasing dominance of synthetic drugs , such as methamphetamine , and fentanyl which have transformed illicit drug markets due to their low cost and ease of production. Drug use disorder cases have surged by 45% in the last ten years Accelerated environmental devastation and crime caused by drug traf ficking in the Amazon Basin. Only one in five individuals with drug use disorders received treatment in 2021, with significant regional disparities in access to treatment Illicit drug economies exacerbate conflicts, human rights abuses, and environmental devastation. Illicit drug economies accelerate conflicts, human rights abuses , and environmental devastation Illicit drug trade finances non-state armed and insurgency groups in the Sahel region. Prioritizing public health in regulating med On South Asia: The opium ban in Afghanistan had a positive result, but concerns remain about the production of synthetic drugs. Also, farmers’ income has suf fered in Afghanistan due to the Opium ban by the T aliban. Recommendations: The report calls for increased monitoring of public health impacts as regulatory changes and clinical trials involving psychedelics progress. Prioritizing public health, prevention, and access to treatment services worldwide to ensure that drug challenges do not leave more people behind.
