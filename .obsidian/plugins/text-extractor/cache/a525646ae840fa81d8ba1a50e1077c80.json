Article 355 of the Indian Constitution [Part XVIII (Article 352-360) - “Emergency Provi- sions”] Description It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every state in India against external aggression and internal disturbances and to issue directions to any state to ensure compliance with the Union’s laws and regulations. Significance The provision is designed to en- sure that the government can act swiftly and decisively in the event of any disturbance or threat to the peace and security of the state/ country. Recently, it was invoked in Manipur. Article 355 vs 356 Article 356 empowers the Presi- dent to impose President’s Rule in a state in case of a failure or breakdown of constitutional ma- chinery in a state. Under Article 356, all of the state machinery is taken under the cen- tre’s jurisdiction. However, under Article 355, only the state’s law and order (a state subject) is tak- en under the centre’s jurisdiction (duration not specified in the Con- stitution). Recommenda- tions to pre- vent misuse S.R. Bommai’s case (1994), which held that the power of the Pres- ident to dismiss a State govern- ment (under Article 356) is not absolute. Sarkaria Commission Report, which had explained a whole range of actions on the part of the Centre possible under Article 355. www.insightsonindia.com3 Writs in the Indian Constitution: ● Meaning: It is a legal document issued by the court that orders a person or entity to perform a specific act or to cease performing a specific action. ● Constitutional provisions: Issued by the Supreme Court under Article 32 and by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. ● Types: Habeas Corpus (to have a body of), Manda- mus (we command), Quo Warranto (by what war- rant(, Certiorari (to certify) and Prohibition. ● Article 32 vs 226: The ruling: ● The Madras HC passed the ruling while dismissing a writ petition which claimed that the constitutional machinery had broken down due to the attack on IT officials by a mob. ● The HC held that Article 355 appeared to have been inspired both by the US and the Australian Consti- tution. ● The scope of Article 355 enables the Union to ren- der all assistance, even if the State Government has not made any specific request. ● The incident of IT officials being mobbed would not qualify as an internal disturbance under the pur- view of Article 355. ● The expressions - ○ ‘internal disturbance’ could only refer to a sense of domestic chaos (could take the co- lour of a security threat) and ○ ‘external aggression’ would require a large- scale public disorder (endangering the secu- rity and administration of the State).

The practice of manual scavenging in India: ● Meaning: Manual scavenging includes the disposal of human excreta manually from dry latrines, and public streets and the maintenance and sweeping of septic tanks, sewers and gutters. ● Prevalence in India: ○ As many as 58,000 people worked as manu- al scavengers as of 2018. ○ In 2022, 48 people died due to hazardous cleaning of sewers in 2022. This number was 49 in 2021, 19 in 2020, and 117 in 2019. ○ The practice, which is considered the worst remaining evidence of untouchability, is most prevalent among people from lower castes/Dalits. Attempts to abolish manual scavenging: www.insightsonindia.com4 Salient features of the Prohibition of Employment as Man- ual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013: ● It bans manual scavenging. ● It widened the definition of manual scavengers by including it in all forms of manual removal of human excreta. ● It lays a key focus on rehabilitating manual scaven- gers by organising training programs (at a stipend of Rs. 3000) and offering scholarships to their children. ● It makes the offence of manual scavenging cogniza- ble and non-bailable. ● It makes it obligatory for employers to provide pro- tective tools to the workers. Other efforts: ● The scheme for rehabilitation of manual scaven- gers: Under this, ~58,000 identified sewer workers have been given a one-time cash payout of ₹40,000 each. ○ In addition, ~22,000 of them have been con- nected to skills training programmes. ● NAMASTE scheme: For 100% mechanisation of sewer work. The scheme (launched in 2022) for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers has now been merged with the NAMASTE scheme. Concerns: ● Lack of funding: The Union Budget 2023-24 showed no allocation for the rehabilitation scheme and ₹100 crore allocation for the NAMASTE scheme. ● Less than half of the identified sewer workers are connected to skills training programmes. ● Despite all efforts, manual scavenging is still prac- tised in India. Just 520 districts across the country had declared themselves free of manual scavenging. Way ahead: ● The immediate focus of administrations should be to ensure zero deaths due to hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. ● All local bodies must identify and profile all septic tank/sewer workers in their respective areas. ● Provide them with occupational training and safety equipment. ● Sign them up for health insurance under the Ayush- man Bharat scheme. Best practices: ● The Bandicoot Robot is the world’s first robotic scavenger, developed as a Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative by the startup Genrobotics. ● Kerala became the first state in the country to use robotic technology (Bandicoot) to clean all its com- missioned manholes.

Howev- er, the SCO summit initially planned as an in-person event but later turned into a virtual summit, may have been im- pacted by various factors, including the Prime Minister’s U.S. State visit and concerns over tensions with China and Paki- stan. With India’s SCO chairpersonship ending, it is feared, there may be a sense of diminishing returns from its engage- ment with the SCO Conclusion: Despite the constraints of SCO, the present outcomes high- light the significance of India’s chairing of the summit, the expansion of SCO membership, cooperation on key issues, and India’s stance on regional security concerns.

Chemical signals, known as info- chemicals, play a crucial role in interactions between organ- isms and regulate ecological processes. Climate change is altering the production of these chemicals, such as phero- mones, affecting various species and disrupting vital func- tions and behaviours. •\t Example 1: Warming temperatures decay the pher- omones used by some ant species, making it difficult for them to follow trails. www.insightsonindia.com6 •\t Example 2: Rising CO₂ levels in water affect the eva- sion abilities of water fleas, while coral reef damsel- fish lose their ability to recognize predators. •\t Example 3: Climate change-associated stressors dis- rupt chemical interactions across entire ecosystems, with implications for disease-causing pathogens and their hosts. Understanding these impacts is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change on communication and preserving ecological balance.

The petition: ● Has challenged the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 issued under Article 341(1) of the Con- stitution. ○ Article 341 (1) authorises the President to declare certain castes and classes as Sched- uled Castes in a State (after consultation with the Governor) or a UT. ○ The 1950 Order mandates that anybody who is not a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist cannot be granted Scheduled Caste status. ● Since the word ‘religion’ does not even exist in Arti- cle 341(1), the ban concerning Christians and Mus- lims in the 1950 Order should be deleted. Scheduled caste status for Dalit converts: ● The Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission (2007) recommended that Scheduled Caste reservation be provided for Dalit converts to Christianity and Islam. The Centre had rejected the report. ● A new Commission (under K.G. Balakrishnan) was established in 2022 to report on the question of granting SC status to persons who have historically belonged to the SC but have converted to religions other than Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. SWAMIH INVESTMENT FUND Context: The PM has congratulated new homeowners in Ben- galuru’s first project under SWAMIH Fund which has helped more than 3000 families in owning their dream homes. What is the SWAMIH Investment Fund? ● The Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) is a social impact fund specifi- cally formed (in 2019) for completing stressed and stalled residential projects. ● The Fund is sponsored by the Ministry of Finance and is managed by SBICAP Ventures Ltd - a State Bank Group company. ● It is considered the lender of last resort for dis- tressed projects since it considers - ○ First-time developers, ○ Established developers with troubled proj- ects, ○ Developers with a poor track record of stalled projects, ○ Customer complaints and NPA accounts, and ○ Even projects where there are litigation is- sues. ● The Fund’s presence in a project often acts as a cata- lyst for better collections and sales primarily in proj- ects that were delayed for years. ● It has raised Rs 15,530 crore so far with an aim to provide priority debt financing for the completion of stressed, brownfield and RERA-registered residen- tial projects that fall in the affordable, mid-income housing category. REGULATION OF THE DIGITAL MARKET Context: The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and the Ministry of Information Technology (MeitY) in India have www.insightsonindia.com7 clarified their respective roles in the regulation of the digi- tal market, to remove the duplicity of regulations on digital markets. Demarcated Roles: Ministry Role Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Oversees all competition issues in the digital market. Ministry of Informa- tion Technology (Me- itY) Handles sector-specific and tech- nical issues in the digital market. Status of India’s digital market: •\t India’s digital market is experiencing rapid growth and transformation. It encompasses various sectors such as e-commerce, digital payments, online ser- vices, social media, and digital advertising. It is ex- pected to touch $ 1 trillion by 2025-26. •\t The government is working towards introducing leg- islation including Digital India Act and Digital Com- petition Law to regulate the growing digital market. RELEASE OF TREATED WATER INTO THE SEA AT FUKUSHIMA Context: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted a safety review and concluded that Japan’s plans to release treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station into the sea are consistent with international safety standards. Background of the event: In 2011, a major nuclear accident occurred at the Fukushi- ma Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan following a massive earthquake and tsunami. The natural disaster led to a loss of power and cooling system failures, resulting in the meltdowns of three reactors and the release of radio- active materials. It was one of the most significant nuclear accidents since the Chornobyl disaster in 1986. Water Treatment: Water stored at the site got contaminated during the inci- dent. The contaminated water had caesium and strontium. They were removed periodically and now the water has been treated through an Advanced Liquid Processing Sys- tem (ALPS) to remove almost all radioactivity, aside from tri- tium. Before discharging, Japan will dilute the water to bring the tritium to below regulatory standards. About IAEA: The International Atomic Energy Agency (HQ: Vienna; founded: 1957) is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons. Purpose: The IAEA strengthens the global nuclear safety and secu- rity framework. It identifies and promotes best practices and safety standards and implements programs to assist states in applying these standards. The IAEA is also a key player in the effort to prevent nuclear terrorism. FEROCIOUS BLACK HOLES REVEAL ‘TIME DILATION’ IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE Context: Scientists conducted a study using observations of quasars, powerful black holes, to demonstrate “time dila- tion” in the early universe. •\t The study showed that time passed only about a fifth as quickly as it does today, around 12.3 billion years ago when the universe was much younger. About Quasars: •\t Quasars are tremendously active supermassive black holes millions to billions of times more mas- sive than our sun, usually residing at centres of gal- axies. •\t They devour matter drawn to them by their im- mense gravitational pull and unleash torrents of ra- diation including jets of high-energy particles, while a glowing disk of matter spins around them. Significance: •\t This supports Einstein’s theory of relativity, which states that time and space are intertwined and that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. •\t Time dilation means that if one could travel back to www.insightsonindia.com8 that time, a second would still feel like a second, but from the perspective of a person today, a sec- ond back then would unfold in five seconds. This study adds to previous evidence of time dilation based on observations of supernovas, and it high- lights the complexity of time in modern physics. GRAVITY HOLE Context: A recent study suggests that the colossal and mys- terious “Gravity Hole” in the Indian Ocean may be the rem- nants of an ancient sea that disappeared millions of years ago. What is Gravity Hole? A “Gravity Hole” refers to a large gravity anomaly, an area where gravity is significantly different from the surrounding regions. It is characterized by a substantial decrease in gravitational pull compared to the expected value based on the Earth’s normal gravitational field. The causes of gravity holes can vary, including geologi- cal structures, variations in mass distribution, or other factors that affect the gravitational field in a particular area. The phenomenon is estimated to have formed approximate- ly 20 million years ago and is expected to endure for mil- lions more. More about the News: The Gravity Hole is a massive region in the Indian Ocean, about 1,200 kilometres southwest of the south- ernmost tip of India, and has such a low pull of gravity that the sea level of the Indian Ocean over the “hole” is around 106 metres below the global average. This pronounced dip in the ocean is called Indian Ocean geoid low (IOGL) and was discovered in 1948 •\t Known as the Indian Ocean geoid low (IOGL), this vast depression spans over 2 million square miles and lies more than 600 miles beneath the Earth’s crust. •\t The study proposes that the IOGL consists of slabs from the Tethys Ocean, which was a sea that sepa- rated the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laura- sia. •\t The Tethys Ocean is believed to have influenced the African Large Low Shear Velocity province, generat- ing plumes beneath the Indian Ocean. CMV AND TOMV Context: Tomato growers in Maharashtra and Karnataka have reported crop losses due to attacks by two different viruses: the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Maharashtra and the tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) in Karnataka and other South Indian states. •\t Both viruses belong to different viral families and spread through different means. •\t ToMV primarily spreads through infected seeds, saplings, and agricultural tools, while CMV is trans- mitted by aphids. •\t High temperatures followed by intermittent rain create favourable conditions for CMV spread. Controlling these viruses involves following biosafety stan- dards, treating seeds, discarding infected material, and practising good agricultural practices. CMV has a wide range of hosts, making control more challenging, while ToMV can remain dormant in weeds and plant remains. NATURE RESTORATION LAW Context: The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has called on the European Union (EU) to invest in nature restoration, emphasizing the long-term economic im- pacts of failing to do so. What is Nature Restoration Law? The Nature Restoration Law is a proposed legislation aimed at restoring and conserving natural areas and ecosystems. It sets legally binding targets for nature restoration in var- ious sectors such as agriculture, forest, marine, freshwater, and urban systems. EU’s agreement: •\t In May 2023, the IUCN urged the EU to come up with a targeted and meaningful restoration for strengthening the resilience and sustainability of the EU economy. •\t The EU Council recently agreed to restore 20% of its land and sea by 2030 and pledged to restore entire ecosystems by 2050. Importance of Nature restoration: •\t The IUCN highlights the impressive returns of fi- nancing nature restoration, with every Euro spent having an eight-fold return and benefits worth 38 Euros. •\t Nature restoration is important for resilience, cli- mate and biodiversity targets •\t It plays a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosys- tems in achieving these goals. www.insightsonindia.com9 About IUCN: The International Union for Conservation of Nature (HQ: Gland, Switzerland, Founded: 1948) is an international or- ganization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. Mapping TAIWAN Taiwan has announced the opening of its third representa- tive office in India, in Mumbai, in a move aimed at strength- ening economic linkages between the two countries.
