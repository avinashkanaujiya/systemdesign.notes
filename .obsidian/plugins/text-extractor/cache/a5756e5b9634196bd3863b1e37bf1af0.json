Private Healthcare Introduction • Private spending still constitutes nearly 60% of overall expenditure on health in India. • This is driven by the dominant role of the private health sector. Healthcare Expenditure • India ranks poorly on multiple health financing indicators. • Its public health expenditure as a percentage of its GDP (1.28%) and share of general government expenditure dedicated to health (4.8%) remain akin to the poorest countries. • Per capita health spending growth has not kept pace with rising incomes. • The issue of high healthcare costs remains limited to what the government can do to share the personal expenditure burden. Concerns / Challenges • The private sector in India is marked with inequities between rural and urban areas and widespread market failure. • In India, the income disparities, backwardness, and under-regulation incentivised the private sector. • These often provide care at apparently inexpensive rates but of dubious quality. • Many States have their own Clinical Establishments Acts that are stuck short of full implementation. • The high costs of medical education trigger cost recovery through resource-intensive ways of practice. Way Forward • Initiatives that make private healthcare more affordable without affecting care quality assume importance. • This requires a range of policy instruments that alter the operating conditions of the private sector. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Such policies have to be enshrined in our national health policy. • We need overarching policies that drive down private healthcare costs even for the self-paying consumer with little or no government subsidy. • Need to regulate rates and standards of care in the private sector. • Widening the ambit of practice of nurses and allied personnel should form a strong emphasis of health policy. • Creating affordable and effective private health insurance products. Conclusion • No country in the world has ever achieved universal healthcare through predominantly private means. • Affordable private healthcare must only come to supplement strong public healthcare, while in turn having a complementary effect in enhancing the efficiency of government health spending.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
