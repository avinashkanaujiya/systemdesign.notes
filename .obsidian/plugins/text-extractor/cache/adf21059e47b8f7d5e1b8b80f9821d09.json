Global refugee crisis Introduction • The refugee crisis is not just a humanitarian one, but also a development crisis. • Refugees are not migrants by choice. They have grounded reasons to leave their homes behind. • The global refugee crisis has grown enormously since 2010. Reasons • Increasing socio-political, economic and environmental uncertainties can make any country insecure, resulting in people fleeing. Seeking Asylum • To seek asylum is a Universal Human Right. • Therefore, every country is responsible for providing safe harbour to asylum seekers. Status of South Asia • South Asia is host to 3 million refugees. • It lacks inclusive policies to help steadily growing numbers. • Refugees in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are from neighbouring regions. Response • Refugee issues are approached from a ‘management framework’, thus restricting entry. • From redirecting and stopping small boats to building walls have become a response. • Such policies are adopted by administrations that lack the political will for sustainable solutions. Funding Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • The global north hosts only 15% of the world’s refugees, but has financial power over refugee organizations. • Low and middle-income countries (LMCs) host 85% of all refugees. • 88% of the world’s refugee programmes are underfunded, and also politicized based on ethnicities, religions and historical backgrounds. • Some countries see in-country refugee expenses as part of their Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) commitments and reduce funding for refugee programmes. Identification Crisis • The common challenge for refugees is identification documents. • International organizations cannot address this unilaterally, as identification requires a degree of acceptance by local communities. • In Turkey refugees faced challenges in accessing healthcare during the recent earthquake since they lacked acceptable IDs. Concerns / Challenges • Syrian conflict’s exodus, Rohingya movement from Myanmar, Afghan displacement and many others, are far from reaching any settlement. • Solutions are sought within an outdated framework that can no longer absorb new migration regimes. • Depending on current international frameworks to address global problems is unsustainable. • For refugees to fill employment gaps is tough. • Even a UNHCR refugee card is not an acceptable ID for accessing essential services. • When refugee support is unregulated, human trafficking, illegal drug networks and black markets accelerate. Way Forward • Refugee settlement can be done by integration, voluntary repatriation and third-country resettlement. • Jordan, Kenya, Uganda, Germany and Canada choose integration through local policies and gain socio-economically, just as refugees do. • Providing them work opportunities is vital for their integration and self-reliance. • Recognize the existence of refugees and grant them access to essential services. • Canada’s refugee policy has supported 40,000 Afghan refugees since 2021. • Opportunities to acquire local languages can open doors in labour markets and enable refugees to participate in a country’s economy.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
