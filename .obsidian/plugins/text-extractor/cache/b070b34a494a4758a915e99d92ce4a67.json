The Role of Panchayats in tackling Climate Change Introduction • With rural households among the most vulnerable to climate change effects, panchayats can play a pivotal role in tackling the causes and consequences of global warming. Need to involve Panchayats • If India has to achieve the goals enunciated in the ‘Panchamrit’ resolution of the COP26 climate summit, it is necessary that panchayati raj institutions are involved. • It is necessary to have a suitable local action plan for implementation and enforcement, initiated and coordinated by local governments. • India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change 2008 identifies a range of priority areas for intervention at the national and State levels. • However, there would have been better results had panchayati raj institutions been given a greater role. India’s Vulnerability • Over the past few decades, there has been a manyfold increase in the number of climate-related national disasters. • Much of India’s population still lives in the rural areas and is involved in agriculture and other agri- based activities. • The greater variability in rainfall and temperatures has directly affected the livelihood and well-being of millions of rural households. Carbon neutrality projects across India • Human activities are the cause of the current climate crisis. • Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to extreme weather events are critical. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Zero carbon development is the effective solution to reducing anthropogenic emissions and improving climate resilience. Carbon neutral Meenangadi • In recent years, many panchayats have come forward with the concept of carbon neutrality. • A prominent example being Meenangadi gram panchayat in Kerala’s Wayanad district. • In 2016, the panchayat envisaged a project called ‘Carbon neutral Meenangadi’, the aim being to transform Meenangadi into a state of carbon neutrality. • An awareness programme was conducted initially. A greenhouse gases emission inventory was also prepared. • The panchayat was found to be carbon positive. • Several multi sector schemes were implemented to reduce emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and preserve the ecology and bio-diversity. • ‘Tree banking’ was one of landmark schemes introduced to aid carbon neutral activities which encouraged the planting of more trees by extending interest-free loans. • The entire community was involved in the process, with school students, youth, and technical and academic institutions. Example of Palli gram panchayat • There is also the example of Palli gram panchayat in Jammu and Kashmir that has followed the people-centric model. • The panchayat has prepared a climate-resilient plan where villagers have been made aware of climate change Mitigation. • A solar plant (500KW) has been installed to power 340 households. Initiatives by many other panchayats • There are many other panchayats that have also initiated carbon neutral programmes. • In Seechewal gram panchayat, the Kali Bein river was rejuvenated with people’s involvement. • Odanthurai panchayat in Tamil Nadu has its own windmill (350 KW). • Tikekarwadi gram panchayat in Maharashtra is well known for its extensive use of biogas plants and green energy production. • Chapparapadavu gram panchayat in Kerala has several green islands that have been nurtured by the community. Way Forward • There is a need for the documentation of best practices on carbon neutral programmes and for wider dissemination. • The integrated Panchayat Development Plan prepared by all panchayats is a stepping stone towards addressing many of the environmental concerns of villages. • India’s rural local bodies must contribute their strength to ensure the global target of carbon neutrality, as envisaged in the UN conference on climate change.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
