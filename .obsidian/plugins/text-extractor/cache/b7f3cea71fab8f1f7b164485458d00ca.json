Reforms to internationalise the rupee • Rupee must be made more freely convertible, with a goal of full convertibility by 2060. • This would allow foreign investors to easily buy and sell the rupee, enhancing its liquidity and making it more attractive. • RBI should pursue a more liquid rupee bond market, enabling foreign investors to have more investment options in rupees. • Indian exporters and importers should be encouraged to invoice their transactions in rupee. • Currency swap agreements would allow India to settle trade and investment transactions in rupees. • Tax incentives to foreign businesses to utilise the rupee in operations in India. • Making the rupee an official currency in international organisations, thereby giving it a higher profile and acceptability. • The Tarapore Committees’ recommendations must be pursued including a push to reduce fiscal deficit, inflation and non-performing assets.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
