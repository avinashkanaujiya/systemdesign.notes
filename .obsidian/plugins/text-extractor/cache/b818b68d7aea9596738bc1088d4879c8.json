The Collegium system: ● About: ○ The collegium system, which has evolved through judgments of the SC, is the way by which judges of the SC and HCs are appoint- ed and transferred. ○ It is a five-member body, headed by the in- cumbent CJI and comprises the four other senior most judges of the SC at that time. ● Evolution - Three Judges Cases: ○ S.P. Gupta & Others v. Union of India (1981), Advocate on Record Association v. UoI (1993) and re Presidential Reference case (1998). ○ It was established that the recommendation made by the CJI without following the con- sultation process for the appointment of SC and HC Judges is not binding on the govern- ment. ● Criticism: ○ The system is non-transparent since it is seen as a closed-door affair with no pre- scribed norms regarding eligibility criteria, or selection procedure. ○ The system is opaque and not accountable. Judges do not appoint judges all over the world, but in India, they do. ○ Limited role of the government, may object to and seek clarification on the collegium’s choices, but if the collegium reiterates the same names, the government is bound to appoint them. ● Efforts to reform the collegium system: NJAC, Mem- orandum of Procedure (MoP), etc. How has the appointment process been streamlined re- cently? ● Adding a balanced mix of merit and seniority www.insightsonindia.com3 through a selection procedure which involves mean- ingful discussion on and assessment of candidates’ judicial acumen. ● Recommendations of the Collegium are now noti- fied within days by the government. ● The requirements for candidates’ consideration have been made public by the Collegium’s resolu- tions. Points under the Collegium’s consideration: ● Quality of judgments of the candidates: A Judg- ment Evaluation Committee goes through the judi- cial work of the candidates. ○ Justice Dipankar Dutta’s name was the first to be cleared for SC appointment by the Col- legium in this manner. ● The seniority of Chief Justices and senior puisne Judges in their respective parent HCs as well as over- all seniority of the HC Judges. ● The merit, performance and integrity of the judges are under consideration. ● The need to ensure diversity and inclusion in the SC. Diversity and inclusion means - ○ Representation of HC not/inadequately rep- resented; ○ Appointment of persons from marginalised and backward segments of society; ○ Gender diversity (Justice Sunita Agarwal ap- pointed as the CJ of the Gujarat HC); and ○ Representation of minorities. ● The need to ensure the better administration of justice: As a result, the Collegium did not bow to the request made by three HC judges against their out- of-State transfers.

Neither 1 nor 2 Ans: 2 GS Paper 2 ISSUE OF SUCCESSION FACED BY THE REGIONAL POLITICAL PAR- TIES IN INDIA Syllabus: Pressure Groups & Formal/informal Associa- tions & Their Role in Polity Context: 24 years after its formation, the Nationalist Con- gress Party (NCP) split over the question of succession. Similar cases: ● The Shiv Sena, Samajwadi Party (SP) have gone through this churn. ● The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) seems poised to undergo this churn. The rise of regional parties in India: ● It coincided with the decline of Congress in the 1990s. ● They were basically caste-based alignments, with the Mandal movement providing the necessary prompt. Characteristics of regional parties in India: ● Have a regional agenda (concentrates on regional or local matters) and recognise a distinct religious, ethnic, cultural or linguistic group. ● The electoral ground is restricted to a specific state or region. Reasons for succession battles in several regional parties in India today: ● Have become ‘Hindu undivided families’: Consist- ing of all those who have directly descended from a common ancestor as well as their wives and unmar- ried daughters. ● Have given up their larger purpose: ○ Many of these parties began with the goals of promoting sub-nationalism, protecting their own caste or ethnicity and larger fed- eral interests (DMK). ○ But over a period of time, they have all be- come parties strangled in family feuds. ● Have a centralised party structure, low intra-par- ty democracy, and are often controlled by a single family. ● Have not evolved with time: There is splinter- ing within castes and caste identity itself has gone through a lot of change. ○ The ideological divide is thinning, forcing everybody to go beyond family, caste, or ethnic loyalty to create a larger purpose. www.insightsonindia.com4 Implications of these succession battles: With the decline of regional parties, the challenges to a dominant party system will reduce. Challenges for regional parties: ● The paradox about regional parties is that the family is central to their survival, but the family is also a liability. ● Absence of charismatic leaders: For example, for the BJD, who will be the leader after Naveen Patnaik is a worrying question. Way ahead: ● The regional parties have to come up with an inter- nal decision-making process for anointing the next leader. ● These regional parties can have a think tank (like RSS for BJP) that sits as the arbitrator to look for an alternative when required.

(UPSC 2016) GS Paper 2 EFFORTS TO REFORM THE STATIS- TICAL SYSTEM IN INDIA Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors Context: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Imple- mentation (MoSPI) has constituted a Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) to reform the statistical system in India. India’s statistical machinery MoSPI It came into existence as an Independent Ministry in 1999 after the merger of the Department of Statistics and the Depart- ment of Programme Implementation. It has two wings - Statistics and Pro- gramme Implementation. The Statis- tics Wing Called the National Statistical Office (NSO), it consists of the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Computer Center and the Na- tional Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Besides these two wings, there is the Na- tional Statistical Commission (NSC) and one autonomous Institute of National im- portance - the Indian Statistical Institute. Mandate of NSO NSO is the nodal agency for the planned development of the statistical system in the country. It coordinates the statistical work in re- spect of the Ministries or Departments of the Government of India and maintains li- aison with international statistical organi- sations (UNSD, ESCAP, etc). It prepares national accounts as well as publishes annual estimates of national products and provides statistical informa- tion to assess and evaluate the changes in the growth, composition and structure of the organised manufacturing sector. It compiles and releases the Index of In- dustrial Production (IIP), Conducts the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), all-India Economic Censuses and follow-up enter- prise survey. Criticism Bibek Debroy - the chairperson of the Eco- nomic Advisory Council (EAC) to the PM, had suggested an overhaul of the system and contended that the Indian Statistical Service has “little expertise in survey de- sign”. About the SCoS: ● It will replace: The Standing Committee on Econom- ic Statistics (SCES), which was constituted in 2019 to examine economic indicators only. ● Chairman: India’s first chief statistician and the for- mer chairman of the NSC - Pronab Sen, has been named the chair of the new committee. ● Mandate: ○ To provide a new internal oversight mecha- nism for official data, and ○ To review the framework and results of all surveys conducted under the aegis of the NSO. ○ While the panel will help finalise survey results, the NSC will have the ultimate au- thority to approve the publication of those results. ● Terms of reference: ○ To ensure more coverage, the panel - \tHas 10 official members and 4 www.insightsonindia.com5 non-official members who are eminent academics. \tWill look beyond economic data and advise the Ministry on tech- nical aspects (sampling, design, methodology) for all surveys. ○ To identify data gaps to be filled by official statistics, along with an appropriate strategy to plug those gaps. ○ To explore the use of administrative statis- tics to improve data outcomes. Concerns Related to the Indian Statistical System Institutional and Structural Issues Not released timely: The gov- ernment have a timetable for the release of national accounts, the Index of Industrial Produc- tion and inflation. But there are no specific timelines for the re- lease of labour force statistics and consumption expenditure surveys Apprehensions regarding NSSO: Under MoSPI, it has become part of the general bureaucra- cy and ceases to exist as an au- tonomous body. Moreover, the fear is that in the absence of the oversight of independent bodies like the CSI and NSC, the statisti- cal system may become amena- ble to political interference.

The enrolment ratio of men to women in engineering col- leges in India has improved over the years. However, the proportion of women in IITs remains low, with some insti- tutes having as little as 5% to 12% female representation in 2014. Implications of Underrepresentation of Women in Higher Education in India: Implications Examples Limited Access to Opportuni- ties Women miss out on educational and ca- reer opportunities, limiting their poten- tial for growth and advancement. Gender-Based Stereotyping and Bias Stereotypes reinforce gender roles, limit- ing women’s choices in pursuing certain fields of study or careers. Une qual W o rkf o r ce Re pre se nta - tion Fewer women in higher education result in a limited pool of qualified female pro- fessionals in various sectors, leading to gender imbalance in the workforce. Economic Dis- parities Women’s lower participation in higher education can contribute to the gender pay gap and economic disparities be- tween men and women. Lack of Di- verse Perspec- tives The absence of women’s voices and per- spectives in academia limits the develop- ment of inclusive knowledge and hinders innovation. R ei n f o r ce - ment of Social Norms The underrepresentation of women in higher education perpetuates traditional societal norms and expectations, hinder- ing progress towards gender equality. Missed Con- tributions to Research and Innovation Society misses out on the unique talents, perspectives, and contributions that women can bring to research and innova- tion in various fields. www.insightsonindia.com6 Government Schemes for Women: Description Digital Gender Atlas Ministry of Human Resource Devel- opment has prepared a digital gen- der atlas for advancing girls’ educa- tion in India. National Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary Edu- cation (NSIGSE) The objective of the scheme is to establish an enabling environment to reduce dropouts and to promote the enrolment of girl children in sec- ondary schools. Nai Manzil An integrated education and skill- ing scheme in partnership with the World Bank, aimed at minority youth without a formal school leav- ing certificate, providing formal ed- ucation and skills for better employ- ment and livelihoods. 30% target allocation for women beneficiaries. Naya Savera A scheme providing financial sup- port to students from minority com- munities to prepare for competitive examinations. 30% allocation for women beneficiaries. Conclusion: Efforts for gender parity continue as women remain a mi- nority at IITs. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in improving the gender ratio at these insti- tutions. Insta Links: Problems Faced by minority women in India Mains Link: Q.

(Mains 2019) GS3 LIGHTENING: NATURAL DISASTER Syllabus: Disaster Management Context: The Indian Union government is reluctant to de- clare lightning a natural disaster, as it believes that deaths caused by lightning can be prevented through awareness of safety measures. •\t India currently has an early warning system for lightning, providing forecasts from five days to up to three hours in advance. Some states like Bihar and West Bengal have been urging the government to classify lightning deaths as natural di- sasters. If declared, victims would be eligible for compen- sation from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), with the central government contributing 75% to the fund. Status of death due to lightning: According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), lightning strikes caused 2,880 deaths in 2021, accounting for 40% of all acci- dental deaths caused by natural forces. What is a Disaster? A disaster is a result of natural or man-made causes that leads to sudden disruption of normal life, causing severe damage to life and property to an extent that available so- cial and economic protection mechanisms are inadequate to cope. In India, the criteria for declaring a disaster as a natural di- saster are typically based on the guidelines provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Criteria for Declaring a Natural Disaster in India: Description Non-Anthro- pogenic The disaster should not be primarily caused by human activities or interven- tions and should result from natural phe- nomena beyond human control. Impact The disaster should cause significant damage, loss of life, or disruption to the environment, infrastructure, or so- cio-economic activities, requiring special- ized response and recovery measures. Verification The occurrence and impact of the disas- ter should be verified and confirmed by relevant government authorities, scien- tific institutions, or disaster management agencies. Recognition The disaster should be recognized as a natural disaster by the concerned state or central government authorities re- sponsible for disaster management. About Lightening: •\t It is a very rapid and massive discharge of electricity into the atmosphere. It is the process of occurrence of a natural ‘electrical discharge of very short du- ration and high voltage between a cloud and the ground or within a cloud’, accompanied by a bright flash and sound, and sometimes thunderstorms. www.insightsonindia.com7 Impacts of Lightning Description Human Casu- alties Between 1972 and 2019, around 90,632 people were killed due to lightning strikes. Lightning is the biggest contributor to ac- cidental deaths due to natural causes. Agri cu l t u r e Sector Frequent lightning strikes adversely im- pact small and marginal farmers. Around 77 per cent of farmers are killed due to lightning as they work in agricultural fields during the Kharif cropping season in the monsoon period. Rural Areas Mainly, rural and forest areas are the most vulnerable due to lightning because of the presence of water bodies and tall trees, with almost 96 per cent of deaths occurring in rural areas compared to ur- ban areas. Regarding deaths due to light- ning, the population in rural areas is more vulnerable than in urban areas. Tribal Popula- tion The Annual Lightning Report 2020-2021 confirms that 60-70 per cent of deaths occurred in tribal populations due to lightning in Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and other states. Other Sectors Lightning also adversely impacts the avia- tion, power, and communication sectors. Insta Links: •\t How lightning strikes? GS4 J ROBERT OPPENHEIMER Syllabus: Ethics of War/nuclear weapon J. Robert Oppenheimer was the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, the USA’s World War II program to de- velop the first nuclear weapons. He is known as the “Father of the Atomic Bomb”. However, after witnessing the destructive power of nuclear weapons, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate against their proliferation. He found solace and philosophical guid- ance in the Bhagavad Gita, quoting the famous line “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Oppenheimer actively opposed nuclear weapons and worked to curtail their spread. Unfortunately, he faced po- litical persecution during the Cold War era and lost his se- curity clearance. Today, Oppenheimer’s story serves as a cautionary tale and highlights the ethical dilemmas faced by scientists involved in creating powerful weapons. •\t Moral Responsibility: Scientists must consider the potential destruction and harm caused by their weapons. •\t Dual-Use Technology: The technologies they create can be misused or have unintended consequences, raising ethical concerns. •\t Impact on Innocent Lives: Scientists question the ef- fects on civilians, as powerful weapons often cause collateral damage. •\t Contributing to Conflict: Scientists grapple with the ethical dilemma of their work potentially exacerbat- ing conflicts and violence. •\t Long-Term Consequences: Scientists must weigh the lasting effects, including proliferation and the risk of an arms race. •\t Personal Accountability: Scientists may face moral conflicts and be held accountable for the ethical im- plications of their inventions. There are three principles for conduct in war: •\t Discrimination (distinguishing between enemy com- batants and non-combatants) •\t Proportionality (the harms must be proportional to the gains) •\t Actions must be militarily necessary Insta Mains: Q. Can a war ever be justified on moral grounds? Support your answer with suitable arguments. (10M) www.insightsonindia.com8 Content for Mains Enrichment “I AM BECOME DEATH, THE DE- STROYER OF WORLDS” Context: J Robert Oppenheimer used this quote to display regrets about his invention of nuclear weapons. The quote “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” is not directly from the Bhagavad Gita but rather a paraphrase of a verse in the Gita. Translated into English, this verse means: “The Supreme Lord said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.” The verse is part of a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Krishna re- veals his universal form, a divine manifestation displaying his supreme power and cosmic nature. Arjuna is awe-struck and becomes aware of the immense destructive power that Krishna wields as the God of Time. Oppenheimer, who was familiar with the Bhagavad Gita, in- voked this quote to express the profound impact and con- sequences of the atomic bomb, which, like Krishna, brought immense destructive power and the potential to annihilate entire worlds. Refer to the CME article on J Robert Oppenheimer for the ethical dimension of it. Facts for Prelims (FFP) ENDOGAMY AND HARMFUL GE- NETIC VARIANTS IN INDIA Context: A study by researchers at the Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, focused on genetic differ- ences among South Asian populations, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. •\t The researchers found distinct genetic patterns among different regions, including smaller geogra- phies within India, attributed to endogamous prac- tices like caste-based and region-based marriages. About Endogamy: •\t Endogamy is the practice of marrying within a spe- cific social, cultural, or ethnic group, often with the aim of preserving traditions, customs, and identity within that group. Key Findings: •\t The study also revealed a worrying trend of higher frequency of homozygous genotypes in the South Asian cohort, which can increase the risk of genetic disorders. •\t The research highlighted the need for a detailed map of the Indian genome to understand the coun- try’s incredible diversity and address major hered- itary disorders. Conducting such studies within the country would also pro- tect vulnerable communities from exploitation. Harnessing the power of genetic studies could lead to interventions for major health concerns in India. CPTPP EXPORT PREPAREDNESS INDEX (EPI) REPORT, 2022 Context: NITI Aayog is releasing the third edition of the Ex- port Preparedness Index (EPI) for States/UTs of India for the year 2022 The report discusses India’s export performance, followed by an overview of the country’s sector-specific export per- formance. The report further highlights the need to develop our districts as export hubs in the country and undertakes a district-level analysis of merchandise exports in the coun- try. www.insightsonindia.com9 About the Report: EPI is a comprehensive tool that measures the export pre- paredness of the States and UTs in India. Aim To undertake a comprehensive analysis of States and UTs across export-related parameters in or- der to identify their strengths and weaknesses. To highlight the achievements of states/UTs and encourage peer learning among the states/UTs to uphold the spirit of competitive federalism. Pillars Policy Pillar: Evaluates state’s and UTs’ perfor- mance based on its adoption of the export-relat- ed policy ecosystem at a state and district level, as well as the institutional framework surrounding the ecosystem. Business Ecosystem: Assesses the prevailing busi- ness environment in a state/UT, along with the extent of business-supportive infrastructure and a state/UT’s transport connectivity. Export Ecosystem: Focuses on the export-related infrastructure in a state/UT, trade support provid- ed to exporters, and the prevalence of Research and Development in the state/UT to foster inno- vation. Export Performance: An output-based indicator that gauges the growth of a state’s export over the previous year and analyzes its export concen- tration and footprint on the global markets. Related News India’s exports decline by 22% in June Source: TOI In June, India’s exports experienced a significant decline of 22% to about $33 billion compared to $42.28 billion in the previous year. This is the steepest monthly decline in ex- ports in 3 years. Reasons for the decline: Global slowdown (e.g., the US and Europe); Inflationary pressure; Tightening of Mone- tary policies by developed countries; India’s poor manu- facturing sector’s performance; Companies looking at a China+1 policy are moving to India’s competitor countries like Vietnam AGRI INFRA FUND Context: Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, has launched a new campaign titled BHARAT (Banks Heralding Accelerated Rural & Agriculture Transformation) under the Agri Infra Fund (AIF). •\t The one-month-long campaign aims to raise Rs 7200 crore and will run from July 15, 2023, to Au- gust 15, 2023. About the AIF: AIF is a financing facility launched in July 2020 to provide all- around financial support to farmers, agri-entrepreneurs, FPOs, PACS, Cooperatives, SHGs etc, to create post-harvest management infrastructure and build community farming assets throughout the country. Features: •\t Under it, Rs. 1 Lakh Crore will be provided by banks and financial institutions as loans with interest sub- vention of 3% per annum. •\t It also provides credit guarantee support through the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small En- terprises (CGTMSE) scheme for loans of up to Rs 2 crore •\t The fund will be managed and monitored through an online Management Information System (MIS) platform. •\t It will enable all the qualified entities to apply for loans under the Fund. •\t Duration: FY2020 to FY2029 (10 years) •\t The National, State and District level monitoring committees will be set up to ensure real-time moni- toring and effective feedback. EVOLUTION OF SYNTHETIC GE- NOMES Context: Recent research demonstrates that synthetic life forms with minimal genomes can evolve and out-compete non-evolved versions. What is evolution? Evolution is the process of gradual change and development in living organisms over time. It involves the passing on of traits from one generation to the next, leading to the diver- sity and adaptation of species to their environment. What is Synthetic Genome? A synthetic genome is an artificially created or modified ge- netic material that can be inserted into a living organism. It involves designing and constructing DNA sequences in a laboratory setting, allowing scientists to engineer or manip- ulate the genetic makeup of an organism. •\t For example, scientists have synthesized genomes for bacteria like Mycoplasma mycoides, creating synthetic life forms capable of replication.

About Gibbons: It is the smallest and fastest ape and is found in tropical and subtropical forests in Southeast Asia. The hoolock gibbon, unique to India’s northeast, is one of the 20 gibbon species on Earth, with an estimated population of 12,000. •\t All 20 gibbon species, including the hoolock gibbon, are at a high risk of extinction due to dramatic de- clines in their distribution and populations since 1900, leaving only small populations in tropical rainforests. •\t Threats: The primary threat to the hoolock gibbon in India is the felling of trees for infrastructure proj- ects. •\t Initiatives: The Global Gibbon Network (GGN) aims to protect and conserve gibbons and their habitats by promoting participatory conservation policies and actions. o Aaranyak, a non-profit conservation organi- zation based in Assam, India, is one of the founding organizations of the GGN from seven countries. Controversy regarding conservation status: Initially believed to be two separate species, a genetic anal- ysis by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad in 2021 revealed that there is only one species of ape in India, the hoolock gibbon. However, the International Union for Conservation of Na- ture’s Red List classifies the western hoolock gibbon as en- dangered and the eastern hoolock gibbon as vulnerable, which adds complexity to their conservation status. Mapping NORTH KOREA North Korea conducted a test of its new Hwasong-18 inter- continental ballistic missile (ICBM) using solid propellants. The test has drawn reactions from neighbouring countries, with Japan, South Korea, and the United States expressing concerns about regional stability and emphasizing the need for closer cooperation and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north at the Yalu and Tumen rivers, and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The war between North Korea and South Korea began in 1950 and both governments claimed to be the sole legiti- mate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. www.insightsonindia.com11","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
