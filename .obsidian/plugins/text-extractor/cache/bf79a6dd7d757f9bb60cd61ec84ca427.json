Present Status • According to the UN’s World Water Development Report, 2022, India extracts more than a quarter of the world’s groundwater withdrawal each year; 90 per cent of this water is used for agriculture. Need for regenerative agriculture • If agriculture want to feed India’s undernourished population and drive the economy, it needs to work in harmony with nature, not against it. • Farmers, activists and agricultural research organisations across the world are thus developing methods of chemical-less farming under the wider umbrella of regenerative agriculture. • The key to improving water use and efficiency is enhancing the health and nutrient-holding capacity of the soil. • Study shows severe and widespread deficiency of organic carbon and micronutrients in Indian soils. • The importance of regenerative agriculture was emphasised in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on “Climate Change and Land.” Regenerative agriculture • Regenerative agriculture uses natural inputs and cultivation practices such as crop rotation and diversification. • It includes minimum-till, mulching, multi-cropping and sowing of diverse and native varieties. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • It aspires not only to maintain the resources like soil and water but also to improve them. • The natural inputs help improve soil structure and its organic carbon content. Benefits of Regenerative agriculture • Healthy soil helps in better water storage, transmission, filtering and reduces agricultural run-off. • One per cent increase in soil organic matter per 0.4 ha increases water storage potential by more than 75,000 litres. • Planting water-guzzling and water-efficient crops together or in alternating cycles reduces the frequency and intensity of irrigation. • They conserve energy used by irrigation aids such as pumps. Government Initiatives • In India, the Union government is promoting regenerative agriculture with an aim to reduce application of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and to lower input costs. • States like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and Gujarat too have introduced schemes to promote it. Way Forward • Concerted research is required to understand the role of regenerative agriculture in saving water. • The scientific findings will further help inform policy measures and future initiatives. • There is an immediate and urgent need to provide all the necessary training and support to farmers so that they can prepare the required organic inputs in their own locality.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
