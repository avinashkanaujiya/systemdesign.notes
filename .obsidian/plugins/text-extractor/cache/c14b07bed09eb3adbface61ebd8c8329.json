Key highlights: ● India has registered a decline in the number of mul- tidimensionally poor from 24.85% in 2015-16 to 14.96% in 2019-2021. ● In absolute terms, ~13.5 crore Indians escaped pov- erty during the five-year time period. ● Still, one in seven Indians is multidimensionally poor. What is the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)? ● With its first edition released in 2021, the project is aimed at deconstructing the Global MPI and creat- ing a globally aligned and yet customised India MPI. ● It seeks to draw up comprehensive Reform Action Plans with the larger goal of improving India’s posi- tion in the Global MPI rankings. ● NITI Aayog is the nodal agency for the National MPI, ranking States and UTs based on their performance. Methodology: ● It captures overlapping deprivations in health, edu- www.insightsonindia.com3 cation and living standards to ascertain multidimen- sional poverty. ● Each of the specific parameters (under 3 broad cate- gories) is assigned a value to calculate what is called a ‘deprivation score’. ● The deprivation score is the sum of the weighted status of all the indicators for an individual - if it is more than 0.33, only then an individual is consid- ered multidimensionally poor. ● The primary data source to arrive at these figures was National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5). Highlights of the National MPI Report 2023 (2nd Edition): ● Which indicators have reduced India’s multidimen- sional poverty? Improvements in indicators like ac- cess to cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, and bank accounts. ● Where more improvements are needed? Indicators like nutrition and access to education, where the im- provement has only been marginal. Performance of various states: ● BIMARU states: The number of people in poverty in rural areas witnessed the fastest decline (from 32.59 to 19.28%), owing to improvements in states like Bi- har, UP, MP, Odisha, and Rajasthan. ● Number of states with less than 10% of people liv- ing in multidimensional poverty: ● Doubled between 2016 and 2021 from 7 (Mizoram, HP, Punjab, Sikkim, TN, Goa, and Kerala) to 14 (Tel- angana, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Ma- harashtra, Manipur, and Uttarakhand). ● Except for Bihar, no other state in India has more than one-third of its population living in multidimen- sional poverty. Comparing with Global MPI 2023: ● In 2005/2006, about 645 million people were in mul- tidimensional poverty in India, with this number de- clining to about 370 million in 2015/2016 and 230 million in 2019/2021. ● Thus, 415 million poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021. ● Incidence fell from 55.1 to 16.4%. ● Deprivation in all indicators declined. What is keeping Indians multidimensionally poor? ● Within the health category, 3 sub-indicators - nu- trition, child and adolescent mortality, and maternal health - showed only moderate improvement. ○ Lack of proper nutrition contributed close to 30% - the highest - in the overall calcula- tion of India’s MPI. ● Other indicators that did not record a significant de- cline include lack of years of schooling, inadequate access to maternal health services and less-than-de- sired school attendance. ● Within the standard of living category, ○ While there has been a significant improve- ment in access to cooking fuel, ~44% of In- dia’s population is still deprived of it. ○ While sanitation numbers have improved, over 30% of the population is deprived when it comes to sanitation services. ○ Access to housing also remained to be an indicator where the improvement was only marginal. standard of living criteria. Government’s flagship programmes: ● Health and Nutrition: Poshan Abhiyan and Anaemia Mukt Bharat have contributed to reduced depriva- tions in health. ● Sanitation: Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and Jal Je- evan Mission (JJM) have improved sanitation across the country. ● Cooking fuel: PM Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) has posi- tively transformed lives. ● Other initiatives: Initiatives like Saubhagya (electric- ity), PM Awas Yojana (housing), PM Jan Dhan Yojana (banking), and Samagra Shiksha (education). Conclusion: Consistent implementation across a diverse set of programmes and initiatives that have strong interlinkages will lead to a further reduction in deprivations across multi- ple indicators.

(UPSC 2015) GS Paper 2 TAX CHALLENGES ARISING FROM THE DIGITALISATION OF THE ECONOMY Syllabus: Global Agreements involving India and/or affect- ing India’s interests Context: 138 members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Frame- work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - represent- ing over 90% of global GDP - agreed to an Outcome State- ment. BEPS: ● It refers to corporate tax planning strategies used by multinationals to shift profits from higher-tax ju- risdictions to lower or no-tax jurisdictions. ● The OECD defines BEPS strategies as exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules. It erodes the tax base (costing countries USD 100-240 billion in lost reve- nue annually) of the higher-tax jurisdictions. ● As developing countries have a higher reliance on corporate income tax, they suffer from BEPS dispro- portionately. ● Working together within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, over 135 countries and juris- dictions are collaborating on - ○ The implementation of measures to tackle tax avoidance, ○ Improving the coherence of international tax rules and ○ Ensuring a more transparent tax environ- ment. The objective of the Outcome Statement: It delivered a package to further implement the Two-Pillar Solution to Ad- dress the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy. Two-Pillar Solution/ Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules: These rules were agreed upon in 2021 by 137 countries and jurisdictions under the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS. Significance of 2-Pillar Solution: ● It will define the multinational enterprises (MNEs) within the scope of the minimum tax. ● It will set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis. ● It will impose the top-up tax on a member of the MNE group in accordance with an agreed rule. ● It will provide stability for the international tax sys- tem, making it fairer and work better in an increas- ingly digitalised and globalised world economy. The Summary of the Outcome Statement: ● A text of a Multilateral Convention (MLC) devel- oped by the Inclusive Framework, which allows juris- dictions to reallocate and exercise a domestic taxing right over a portion of MNE residual profits. ● A proposed framework for the simplified and streamlined application of the arm’s length princi- ple. ● The Subject-to-Tax Rule (STTR) together with its implementation framework, will enable develop- ing countries to update bilateral tax treaties to “tax back” income. ● A comprehensive action plan will be prepared by the OECD to support the swift and coordinated im- plementation of the Two-Pillar Solution. www.insightsonindia.com5 About OECD: ● It is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 Member countries, founded in 1961 (under the Rome Treaties of 1957) to stimulate economic progress and world trade. ● It is a forum whose member countries describe themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy.

Data regarding India’s big businesses: According to a former RBI Deputy Governor’s report, ● The share of assets in the non-financial sectors owned by the Big-5 business groups has risen from 10% to 18% between 1991-2021. ● Whereas the share of the next five has fallen from 18% to less than 9%. What causes this industrial concentration? ● Functioning of markets: Given asset-income in- equality and differential power among economic agents, markets do not promote competition but concentration and centralisation. The dangers of such a rapid rise in industrial concentration: ● Stifles competition ● Contributes to inflation or profiteering, through the manipulation of costs and prices. ● Influence institutions of democracy, such as the capture of the media. ● Dilutes the role that civil society can play as a coun- tervailing power. ● In time, leads to undue corporate influence over political processes and the formulation of policy. ● Tendencies of state capture. ● Fosters extreme asset and income inequality. How can this be minimised? By regulating markets to phys- ically prevent the growth of dominant businesses and exces- sively large conglomerates or even break up those that are seen as too big for comfort. Challenges towards regulating markets: ● The state is not independent of the influence of big businesses: The distance between the state and private capital has narrowed hugely, leading to the current situation in which the state promotes big business rather than regulates or curbs the latter. Three trends have signalled this narrowing of political dis- tance: ● The embrace of neoliberalism by powerful voices within and outside the state. ○ This implied the adoption of the view that the role of the state is not to regulate pri- vate capital but to facilitate its growth to foster competition and all-around economic progress. ○ However, the reverse has happened. Exam- ples are in areas such as telecommunica- tions and civil aviation. ● The propagation of the view that the state must help strengthen domestic big business. ○ State policy, diplomacy and public resources had to serve as instruments for the purpose. ○ While liberalisation opened up Indian mar- kets, and subjected much of Indian business to global competition, state intervention www.insightsonindia.com6 (like subsidies) was modified to protect and promote sections of big business. ● The refusal to reduce the influence of money in pol- itics. ○ Over time, the policy has been changed to legitimise corporate donations to political parties, including through the infamous electoral bonds scheme. ○ Thus, big business has turned out to be a prerequisite for garnering the resources needed to manage elections and win elec- toral support. What is frightening in the current situation? ● These tendencies have coalesced into a strategy of strengthening Indian business as part of promoting the national interest. ● Any dissent against centralisation and concentration is being suppressed by the state in the name of na- tional interest. Way ahead: ● Democracies have battled hard to force govern- ments to maintain some distance from private capi- tal in general and big business in particular. ● A broad alliance of diverse classes can push the state to take strong action against monopoly and trustification. ● Similar efforts were seen in India immediately after Independence - License-Permit-Quota Raj. Conclusion: Though License-Permit-Quota Raj of the pre-re- form era is not possible in today’s India, what new India needs is the equitable treatment of all businesses (irrespec- tive of their size) to promote national interest in the long term.

(UPSC 2013) GS3 SMALL MODULAR REACTORS (SMRS) Syllabus: Science and Technology: Nuclear Science Source: BS Context: This article discusses India’s shift towards Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a strategic move in the nuclear energy sector. What are SMRs? They are advanced nuclear reactors with a capacity of up to 300 MW per unit, offering advantages such as simplicity, safety, and cost-effectiveness. •\t SMRs can be factory-made and transported to a site for installation. •\t SMRs are economical and time-efficient, and unlike traditional reactors that require refuelling every 1-2 years, SMRs only need refuelling every 3-7 years. Status of India’s nuclear power: •\t India has over 22 nuclear reactors in 7 power plants across the country which produce 6780 MW of nu- clear power •\t India aims to raise nuclear power to 10% of its en- ergy mix by 2035. Global Status of SMRs: •\t Worldwide over 70 SMR designs are under devel- opment in 17 countries e.g., U.S.’s NuScale Power company, whose 600 MW SMR plant design has been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commis- sion. •\t Russia’s 77 MW SMR, Akademik Lomonosov, was operational as early as 2019. •\t In the U.K., Rolls-Royce is setting up a manufacturing facility for SMRs. Why does India need more nuclear power? • Very limited growth potential for hydropow- er because of conserving biodiversity, the costs of rehabilitating and compensating landowners and the seismological factors in the Himalayas. • India has nearly 210 gigawatts of coal capacity, producing 73% of the electricity of India, which is not environmentally friendly. www.insightsonindia.com7 • Wind and solar powers are intermittent or vari- able. India’s strategy: India’s strategy for nuclear energy transition involves tran- sitioning from larger nuclear power plants to smaller ones, specifically Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The govern- ment aims to engage the private sector through public-pri- vate partnerships to set up SMRs across the country. The long-term goal is to raise nuclear power to 10% of India’s energy mix by 2035. Niti Aayog’s suggestions for SMRs include: •\t Encouraging private sector participation through public-private partnerships. •\t Implementing comprehensive regulatory changes to ensure safety standards and monitoring. •\t Modifying foreign investment policies to attract do- mestic and foreign companies for SMR development in India. Way ahead for India: • The nuclear industry should move towards ‘passive safety’ designs (for nuclear reactors). For example, active cooling pumps. • Enforcing nuclear liability, for example, the Civil Lia- bility for Nuclear Damage Act 2010. • Ending the monopoly of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in reactor operations. Allow other government companies and private sector Conclusion: If India hopes to achieve ‘net zero’ by 2070, it needs ~100 GW of nuclear power by 2050. India needs a portfolio of technologies (including SMRs) to make nuclear pow- er safe and cost-effective (capital cost) over time. Insta Links: Nuclear Technology Mains Links: Q.

One of the caves depicts a fierce battle between the Va- nara brothers Vali and Sugriva, with Rama shooting arrows at Vali. Another cave features a grand sketch of Hanuman carrying the Sanjivani hill in his right hand, symbolizing his mission to save Lakshmana’s life. About Kakatiya Dynasty: •\t Kakatiyas is an Andhra dynasty that flourished in the 12th century CE. The Kakatiya dynasty ruled from Warangal (Telangana) from CE 1083-1323. •\t They were known for the construction of a network of tanks for irrigation and drinking water and there- by gave a big boost to the overall development of the region. •\t There are hundreds of Hindu temples built un- der the patronage of Kakatiya kings like Ga- napati Deva, Rudrama Devi and Prata- parudra in the Kakatiya dynasty. E.g., Thousand Pillar Temple or Rudreshwara Swamy Temple, Telangana. It is a star-shaped, triple shrine (Trikutalayam) dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva and Surya. Facts for Prelims (FFP) DIGITAL TIME VOUCHER SYSTEM FOR POLITICAL PARTIES Context: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has intro- duced a digital time voucher system for political parties to access government-owned electronic media, such as Doordarshan and All India Radio, during elections. What is the Digital time voucher system? The digital time vouchers serve as permissions or alloca- tions of specific time slots for political parties to broadcast or telecast their campaign messages on these media plat- forms. This system streamlines the process, eliminates the need for physical collection, and enhances accessibility and convenience for political parties participating in election campaigns. Significance: •\t This move reflects the ECI’s commitment to lever- aging technology for a smoother electoral process. •\t The scheme aims to provide equitable access to electronic media for campaigning, with base time allotted to each national and state party, and addi- tional time based on their poll performance. Rules: In India, the rules regarding political parties’ access to gov- ernment-owned electronic media, such as Doordarshan and All India Radio, are governed by the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Prasar Bharati Act. •\t Allotment of Airtime: During elections, the ECI man- dates that Doordarshan and All India Radio allocate a certain amount of free airtime to recognized political www.insightsonindia.com9 parties for broadcasting their messages. •\t Time Slots: The ECI determines the time slots for politi- cal parties based on factors like their previous electoral performance and representation in the legislature. Par- ties are allocated fixed time slots for their broadcasts. Other aspects of rules are mandated under the Representa- tion of the People Act, 1951 Facts for Prelims (FFP) RBI’S SOPS TO BANKS FOR RUPEE TRADE Context: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to issue a standard operating procedure (SOP) to banks in order to expedite the issuance of proofs of inward remittances for exporters. Aim: This move aims to address the challenges faced by ex- porters in the rupee-based trading mechanism for foreign trade. Issues with FIRC (Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate)? The issue with Foreign Inward Remittance Certificates (FIRC) arises when the certificate from one bank is not being sent to another, which hampers the generation of electronic bank realisation certificates (e-BRCs). This creates a prob- lem for exporters as e-BRCs serve as proof of payment for their exports and make them eligible for benefits under the Foreign Trade Policy. For example, if an exporter in India receives a payment for their exports from a foreign buyer through a bank, they re- quire a FIRC from that bank as evidence of the inward remit- tance. However, if the FIRC is not transmitted to the export- er’s bank, the exporter cannot obtain the necessary e-BRC, which may prevent them from accessing benefits or incen- tives provided by the government for export transactions. What is FIRC (Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate)? FIRC is a document that acts as a testimonial for all the in- ward remittances entering India. What is an Electronic Bank Realization Certificate(e-BRC)? An Electronic Bank Realization Certificate(e-BRC) is a vital digital certificate for export businesses. A bank issues the e-BRC to confirm that the buyer made payment to the ex- porter against the export of services or goods. The BRC is the proof of realization of payment against exports.
