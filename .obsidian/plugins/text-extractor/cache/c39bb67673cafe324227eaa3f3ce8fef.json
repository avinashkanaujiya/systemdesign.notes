What is Differential Global Navigation Satellite System? DGNSS is a technology that helps make GPS and other satellite navigation systems more accurate . The major GPS system includes GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (Europe), BeiDou (China), NA VIC(India) How does it work? It works by using reference stations on the ground that send correction signals to GPS receivers. These correction signals help the receivers to correct any errors or inaccuracies in the satellite signals they receive. 2/2 Advantages: The implementation of DGNSS has improved GPS error correction accuracy from 5 to 10 meters to less than 5 meters for 100 Nautical Miles from the Indian coastlines. It will also enhance the capabilities of the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships ( DGLL) (under MoPSW) in providing radio aids to marine navigation along the Indian coast. Fulfilment of international navigation obligations of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). Significance : The significance of DGNSS lies in its ability to provide more precise positioning information, and safe navigation, reduce the risk of accidents in port and harbour areas , and fulfil international navigation obligations . About IMO: The International Maritime Organization (agreement in 1948 and came into existence in 1958; HQ: London) is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping . About SOLAS: SOLAS Convention is related to the safety of merchant ships . It first came in 1914 after the famous T itanic incident. About IALA: The International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1957 to collect and provide nautical expertise and advice","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
