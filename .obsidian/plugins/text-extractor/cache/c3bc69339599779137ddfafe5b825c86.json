It is also called cohabitation in some countries. What is the case? A Muslim man and a Hindu woman are around 30 years of age, living together and their relationship is based on mutual love and af fection. They alleged that the local police have been torturing t They sought protection from police harassment, allegedly done on the basis of a complaint made by a family member . What is Kiran Rawat vs State of UP judgment ? It negates the idea of constitutional morality in personal relations, which the Supreme Court of India has repeatedly af firmed. The High Court judgment implied that the live-in relationship is a “ social problem”. Issues with the judgment: 2 /3 The court is carried away by the notions of conventional social morality rather than the constitutional principles on individual autonomy and personal liberty . The court also discarded several Supreme Court judgments, even after citing them, by giving untenable reasons. The High Court traveled much beyond the brief and relied on personal laws on marriage which were irrelevant. The judgment said that Supreme Court verdicts on live-in relationships such as D. V elusamy (2010), Indra Sarma (2013) and Dhanu Lal (2015) were not intended “to promote such relationships The law traditionally has been “biased in favor of marriage”. The High Court essentially rejected the precedential value of the top court verdicts. The High Court made an unnecessary reference to Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr .PC) which talks about maintenance to wives (and not “other women”). The High Court said that extramarital and premarital sex are not recognised under the Muslim law . The “sexual, lustful, affectionate acts prior to the marriage, are ‘Haram’ in Islam The High Court assumed that marriage is a condition precedent for constitutional protection and the exercise of fundamental rights. The verdict shows a clear inclination towards social orthodoxy and religious revivalism. The court only tried to reiterate the traditional beliefs on marriage and morals. The Supreme Court verdicts on fundamental rights : They are not mere adjudication of the inter-party disputes, as conceived by the High Court. Article 141:The law laid down by the Supreme Court is binding on all the courts in the country , as in Article 141 of the Constitution. In the process of constitutional adjudication, t he SC is not ‘encouraging’ or discouraging any social practice or human conduct. Related Supreme Court judgements Joseph Shine vs Union of India (2018): The Court decriminalized adultery as defined under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In Navtej Singh Johar (2018): substantially striking down Section 377 of the IPC dealing with same sex relations. The Supreme Court made a constitutional adjudication rather than mere moral judgment. In Lata Singh (2006): The Court directed police authorities throughout the country to see to it that any adult undergoing inter caste or inter religious marriage is not harassed by anyone. 3 /3 In S. Khushboo vs Kanniammal & Anr . (2010): The Court held: “While it is true that the mainstream view in our society is that sexual contact should take place only between marital partners. There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly engage in sexual relations outside the marital setting”. W ay Forward Deborah L. Rhode: Fidelity is a value, but not one that the state should police” (Adultery: Infidelity and the Law , Harvard University Press). The Allahabad High Court said that the observations of the Supreme Court in these judgments were made in the context of the facts of the respective cases. Facts of every case will vary from one another and there cannot be precedents on facts. The High Court cannot disregard the proposition of law laid down by the Supreme Court on questions of fundamental rights. The judgment is a classic case of judicial indiscipline which the Supreme Court will, hopefully , set right as early as possible. The moral lessons of personal laws will supersede the constitutional tenets is a serious adjudicatory mishap. QUESTION FOR PRACTICE Constitutional Morality’ is rooted in the Constitution itself and is founded on its essential facets. Explain the doctrine of ‘Constitutional Morality’ with the help of relevant judicial decisions. (UPSC 2021) (200 WORDS, 10 MARKS)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
