There are up to 70 billion tonnes of phosphorus in the deposit, enough to meet demand for the next 50 years. About Phosphorous: Phosphorus is a mineral which comes from phosphate rock. It is a finite resource which means there is only a certain amount in the world and it will eventually run out. Around 90% of mined phosphate is used to produce fertiliser for the agriculture industry . Previously , the largest amount of phosphate rock was found in Moroccoâ€™ s western Sahara region , with approximately 50 billion tonnes. China (the largest phosphate producer in the world) and Egypt also have significant phosphate reserves. There are environmental concerns surrounding phosphate, including its role in causing algae blooms in waterways. The refining process for phosphorus extraction can be highly polluting. India: Phosphate rocks are also considered a significant and secondary resource of uranium . India is deficient in Apatite & Rock Phosphate availability . In the case of apatite, India is fully dependent upon imports, while the Rock Phosphate production is only from two states namely , Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh .","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
