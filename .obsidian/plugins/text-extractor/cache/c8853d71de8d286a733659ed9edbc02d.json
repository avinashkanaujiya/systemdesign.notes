The acknowledgement: Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Prime Minister Mark Rutte acknowledged the country’s role in the transatlantic slave trade and expressed remorse for the atrocities committed against enslaved people and their descendants. •\t The government has committed to raising aware- ness, addressing the present-day effects of slavery, and incorporating its history into education. Counterview: However, some critics argue that the apology falls short and has called for reparations and greater recognition of mod- ern-day racism and discrimination. Ethical Viewpoint: The Netherlands’ acknowledgement of its colonial history, including slavery, reflects an ethical standpoint of taking responsibility for past wrongdoings. By apologizing and seeking forgiveness, the Dutch aim to address the moral implications of their actions and promote reconciliation and justice. This acknowledgement also highlights the im- portance of recognizing historical injustices and working towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society. What was Slave Trade? The slave trade between colonies refers to the transporta- tion and trading of enslaved African individuals from Africa to European colonies, primarily during the era of European colonialism. The slave trade was driven by economic interests and re- sulted in the exploitation, suffering, and loss of millions of African lives. www.insightsonindia.com3 Colonial History of the Netherlands and its Impact: History Impact 16th - 19th Cen t u r y : Dutch East India Compa- ny The company established trade networks and colonies in Asia, particularly in pres- ent-day Indonesia. The Dutch gained con- trol over valuable spice trade routes and exploited resources. The Dutch colonized and exploited the re- sources of the Indonesian archipelago. They imposed forced labour, plantations, and harsh policies, leading to local resis- tance and eventual independence strug- gles. 17th - 19th Cen t u r y : Dutch West India Compa- ny (WIC) The WIC focused on the Atlantic slave trade, establishing colonies in the Carib- bean and South America. It profited from the enslavement and trade of Africans. Dutch Gold- en Age (17th Century) The Netherlands experienced economic prosperity, cultural achievements, and scientific advancements due to colonial trade and dominance. Amsterdam be- came a major global trading hub. S u ri n a me and Dutch Ca ri b b ean colonies The Dutch established colonies in the Ca- ribbean, including Suriname, Curacao, St. Eustatius, and others. These colonies re- lied on enslaved labour for plantations and contributed to the Dutch economy. Cultural In- fluence and Legacy The Dutch colonial period left a lasting im- pact on language, architecture, legal sys- tems, and cultural practices in former col- onies. The history of Dutch colonization is a subject of ongoing discussions on racism, reparations, and education. Map of former Dutch colonies History of Dutch Colonialism in India Dutch colonialism in India was characterized by the presence of the Dutch East India Company, which established trading posts and factories in various parts of India, including the Coromandel Coast, Bengal, and Surat (1620s). The first fac- tory founded by Dutch in India was at Masulipatnam in 1605. Their primary focus was on trade, particularly in textiles, spices, and other commodities. They also conquered Sri Lan- ka from the Portuguese and built forts along the Malabar coast. However, their influence in India declined in the 18th century due to the growing power of the British East India Company. The Battle of Colachel in 1741 marked the end of the Dutch presence in South India. Eventually, through the Anglo-Dutch treaties (1812 and 1824), the Dutch lost most of their trading posts in India, further diminishing their colonial presence in the country. Danish Occupation of A&N Islands: Settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. Denmark’s presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain, which made them part of British India in 1869.

(15M) www.insightsonindia.com4 GS Paper 2 CAN A GOVERNOR DISMISS A MINISTER? Syllabus: Issues & Challenges Pertaining to the Federal Structure Context: The Governor of Tamil Nadu (RN Ravi) has dismissed a Minister (V. Senthilbalaji) in the Council of Ministers of TN and later backtracked on his decision keeping the dismissal order in abeyance. About the minister and his dismissal: ● The minister was facing serious criminal proceedings in a number of cases of corruption and was arrested by the ED earlier. ● He was dismissed on the pretext that he will ad- versely impact the due process of law, including a fair investigation that may eventually lead to the breakdown of the Constitutional machinery in the State. Criticism of this unprecedented act of the governor: ● Dismissing a Minister of a government which enjoys an absolute majority in the State legislature, with- out the recommendation of the Chief Minister of the State, is going to set a dangerous precedent. ● It has the potential to destabilise State govern- ments putting the federal and whole constitutional systems in danger. Power of the Governor to dismiss a minister: The Government of India Act 1935: The appointment, sum- moning, determination of their salaries and the dismissal of Ministers shall be exercised by the Governor at his discre- tion. What does the Indian Constitution say? ● According to Article 164 of the Constitution, the CM is appointed by the Governor (without any ad- vice from anyone) and the individual Ministers are appointed by the Governor only on the advice of the CM. ● This implies that the Governor cannot appoint an individual Minister according to his discretion. ● So the Governor can dismiss a Minister only on the advice of the CM. The reason is simple: ● The CM alone has the discretion to choose his Min- isters. He also decides who will not remain as a Min- ister in his Council. ○ This is a political decision of the CM, who is ultimately answerable to the people. ● The Governor is a mere constitutional head and there is no executive function which a Governor can perform independently under the Constitution. (BR Ambedkar) ○ Article 163: A Council of Ministers (led by the CM) shall assist and advise the Governor in the discharge of his duties, except when the Governor is compelled to exercise his discretion under this Constitution. ● The pleasure doctrine is a formal act: This has been brought into the Constitution of India from the Government of India Act 1935. ○ But these words simply refer to issuing the order of dismissal (by the Governor), but only on the advice of the CM. Judicial clarification: ● In Shamsher Singh vs State Of Punjab (1974), the SC declared the President and Governor as the custodi- ans of all executive powers, who exercise these pow- ers in accordance with the advice of their Ministers (except in exceptional situations). ● In Nabam Rebia vs Deputy Speaker (2017), the SC reaffirmed the law laid down in Shamsher Singh and the discretionary powers of the Governor are limit- ed to the postulates of Article 163(1). ○ The Court also set aside the decisions in the Mahabir Prasad Sharma (1968) and Prat- apsing Raojirao Rane (1999) cases, where it was held that the Governor can exercise power under Article 164 in an unfettered manner. Conclusion: In sum, the dismissal of a Minister of the TN Government by the Governor of the State without the ad- vice of the Chief Minister is constitutionally wrong.

Meaning of Criminalization of Politics: The criminalisation of politics refers to the phenomenon where individuals with criminal backgrounds or pending criminal cases actively participate in politics and hold posi- tions of power. It signifies the infiltration of criminal elements into the po- litical system, compromising the integrity and functioning of democratic institutions. Status of Criminalization of Politics: •\t Increase in the number of MPs with criminal charges: In 2004, 24% of parliamentarians had pending crim- inal cases, which rose to 43% in 2019. •\t According to data compiled by the Amicus Curiae, a total of 4,984 criminal cases involving legislators were pending in various courts across the country as of 1st December 2021. •\t In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 159 MPs had de- clared serious criminal cases against them, includ- ing those of rape, murder, attempt to murder, kid- napping, and crimes against women. Causes of Criminalisation of Politics: Causes Examples Vote Bank Politics Candidates and parties engaging in vote-buying and other illegal practices to secure votes Political leaders maintain close ties with criminal elements to mobilize support and win elections Corruption Politicians involved in bribery, embezzle- ment, and other corrupt practices for per- sonal gains Misuse of power and resources for per- sonal enrichment, leading to a culture of corruption in politics Vested Inter- ests Voters prioritise caste, religion, or com- munity affiliations over the criminal re- cords of candidates Election of politicians with criminal back- grounds based on narrow community in- terests rather than merit or accountability Muscle Pow- er Use of muscle power, intimidation, and vi- olence to control elections and suppress opposition Politicians with criminal backgrounds em- ploy “goondas” or hired muscle to influ- ence voters and secure electoral victories Money Pow- er Influence of black money, illegal funding, and mafia connections in financing elec- tion campaigns Politicians use illicit funds to buy votes, manipulate election outcomes, and sus- tain their political dominance Weak Gover- nance Lack of stringent laws and regulations to deter criminal activities in politics Inadequate enforcement of election laws, allowing politicians with criminal records to participate and win elections Impact of Criminalisation of Politics: Impact Description Erosion of Demo- cratic Values Candidates with criminal backgrounds winning elections undermines the principles of free and fair elections, limiting voter choice Weakening of Governance Law-breakers becoming law-makers hampers effective governance Compromised In- tegrity of Institu- tions Normalizes corruption and erodes public trust in government Increased Crimi- nal Activities Politicians involved in organized crime or protection rackets e.g., Recently deceased former MP Atiq Ahmed of Uttar Pradesh had several charges of being involved in Criminal activities Social Disharmo- ny Violence and unrest due to the influ- ence of criminal politicians, Political clashes and violence during elections www.insightsonindia.com6 Deterioration of Public Perception Decreased faith in the political sys- tem and public disillusionment led to lesser participation in the democratic process Undermining the Rule of Law Politicians involved in criminal activi- ties create a culture of impunity Hindrance to De- velopment Diversion of resources for personal gain rather than public welfare Threat to Nation- al Security Politicians with connections to ter- rorist groups or organized crime net- works Suggestions against the Criminalization of Politics: Aspect Summary AD R Re c o m - menda - tion ADR recommends permanent disqualification of candidates convicted of serious criminal of- fences from contesting elections. ADR has also asked the ECI to publish a list of defaulting par- ties. Legal As- pects • Indian Constitution does not specify disqualification criteria due to criminal- ity. • Representation of Peoples Act 1951 (Section 8) disqualifies individuals pun- ished with a jail term of more than two years from standing in elections for six years after the jail term has ended. L a w Commis- sion The 244th report (2014) recommends the disqualification of individuals with charges framed against them at least one year before the scrutiny of nominations for an offence pun- ishable with a sentence of five years or more. Govern- ment Ini- tiative The Union government started a scheme in 2017 to establish 12 special courts for a year to fast-track the trial of criminal cases against MPs and MLAs. Supreme Co u rt Ju d g e - ments • Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India (2002): Candidates must declare criminal and financial records along with educational qualifications. • Lily Thomas v. Union of India (2013): MPs or MLAs convicted of a crime and sentenced to a prison term of two years or more are disqualified from holding office. • Public Interest Foundation v. Union of India (2019): Political parties must publish candidates’ criminal records on websites, social media handles, and newspapers. Other suggestions: •\t State Funding of Elections: Committees on electoral reforms, such as the Dinesh Goswami and Inderjeet Committee, recommend state funding of elections to reduce the use of black money and limit the crim- inalization of politics. •\t Strengthening Election Commission •\t Voters need to remain vigilant and report any mis- use of money, gifts, or inducements during elec- tions. •\t Proactive Role of the Judiciary: Fast-tracking the judicial process can help eliminate corruption and criminal elements from the political system. It re- quires a time-bound justice delivery system, stron- ger actions by the Election Commission, and neces- sary amendments to relevant laws. •\t Amending the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA) of 1951 to disqualify individuals with pending seri- ous criminal charges from contesting elections. Conclusion: The criminalization of politics poses a serious threat to de- mocracy and good governance. It undermines the princi- ples of free and fair elections, affects the integrity of public servants, causes social disharmony, and erodes public trust in the government. Addressing this issue is crucial for the health and functioning of democratic systems. About ADR: Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an electoral watchdog established in 1999 by a group of professors from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmed- abad to pursue electoral reforms in India.

( UPSC 2013) GS Paper 2 INDIA-AFRICA TIES Syllabus: Bilateral, Regional Groupings and Agree- ments involving India and/or affecting India’s interests Context: India’s rise as a global player is inevitably linked to the kind of partnership it enjoys with Africa. www.insightsonindia.com7 India-Africa ties - Background: ● India enjoys historical, political, economic, and cul- tural connections with the African continent for a long back. ● India’s links with the struggle for freedom and jus- tice in South Africa date back to the period during which Mahatma Gandhi started his Satyagraha movement in South Africa. ● India worked consistently to put the issue of apart- heid on the agenda of the UN, NAM and other mul- tilateral organisations. India-Africa ties - Current Status: ● India’s Technical and Economic Cooperation Pro- gramme (ITEC) has been a useful medium for pro- moting cooperation in the development of human resources. ● In the past 15 years and especially since 2014, In- dia-Africa relations have developed steadily but more progress is achievable. ● In this context, the Africa Expert Group (AEG) - es- tablished by the Vivekananda International Foun- dation, presented the ‘India-Africa Partnership: Achievements, Challenges and Roadmap 2030’. Highlights of the India-Africa Partnership (Achievements, Challenges and Roadmap 2030): ● Transitions unfolding in Africa: It is slowly heading toward regional integration and is devoted to de- mocracy, peace and progress, even as countries (like Ethiopia, and Sudan) continue to battle insurgency, ethnic violence and terrorism. ● Sharpening competition among external powers: Countries such as China, the US, Japan, Türkiye, and UAE are competing for strengthening their relations with Africa to ensure - ○ Market access, ○ Gain energy and mineral security, and ○ Increase political and economic influence. Challenges for India: ● No clear Strategy/Vision ● Africa is not the prime focus of India ● Competing powers in Africa: For example, China en- joys consistent and robust relations with the conti- nent since 2000 and is currently its biggest economic partner. ○ China’s role in Africa is recognised as ‘the in- frastructure developer’, ‘the resource pro- vider’, and ‘the financier.’ Recommendations to strengthen India-Africa ties: Political and diplomatic cooperation: ● It should be strengthened by restoring periodic leaders’ summits through the medium of the In- dia-Africa Forum Summit (not held since 2015). ● A new annual strategic dialogue between the chair- person of the African Union (AU) and India’s External Affairs Minister should be launched in 2023. ● Forging consensus among G-20 members on the AU’s entry into the G-20 as a full member. ● The MEA should have a secretary exclusively in charge of African affairs to further enhance the im- plementation and impact of the African policy. Defence and security cooperation: ● The government needs to increase the number of defence missions deployed in Africa, widen the footprint of maritime collaboration, and expand lines of credit to facilitate defence exports. ● More can be done to enhance cooperation on secu- rity and defence issues like counter-terrorism, cyber security and emerging technologies. Economic and development cooperation: ● India-Africa trade of $98 billion in FY22–23 can go up if access to finance through the creation of an Af- rica Growth Fund (AGF) is ensured. ● A special package of measures - ○ To improve project exports and build up co- operation in the shipping domain has been suggested. ○ To promote trilateral cooperation and deep- en S&T cooperation. Socio-cultural cooperation: ● It should be increased through greater interaction www.insightsonindia.com8 between universities, think tanks, civil society and media organisations in India and select African coun- tries. ● Setting up a National Centre for African Studies will be the right step. ● ITEC and Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarships awarded to Africans should be named after famous African figures. ● Visa measures for African students should be liber- alised and should also be given work visas for short periods. Way ahead: ● A special mechanism for implementing the ‘Road- map 2030’. ● Clear Strategy for African Development ● Continue the current focus on capacity building ● Harness Indian civil society organisations, NGOs, and the Indian diaspora ● Promote development-friendly private investments ● Timely completion of projects ● Address concerns about the academic experience in India ● Improve the experiences of Africans in India Conclusion: ● To cater to the needs of a large continent like Africa, India must build partnerships with other countries along the lines of the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor - an economic cooperation agreement between India, Japan and multiple African countries. ● India has a substantive partnership with Africa and a rich fund of goodwill, but it is essential for New Del- hi to review its Africa policy periodically and place a razor-like focus on its implementation.

Santhal rebellion (also known as ‘Hul’) (1855-1856) was a revolt against both the British East India Company and the za- mindari system by the Santhal. The rebellion was led by the four sibling Brothers - Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand and Bhairav. S a n t h a l s and their Migration The Santhal people migrated from the Bir- bhum and Manbhum regions of Bengal to modern-day Santhal Pargana. The Brit- ish relocated them to the forested area of Damin-i-Koh as part of their revenue collec- tion strategy. Reasons be- hind the Hul The Santhals rebelled against the British due to extortions, oppressive extractions, dispossession of property, false measure- ments, and other illegalities. Or g a n i z a - tion of the Hul Contrary to popular belief, the Hul was a well-planned and organized political war. Preparations included guerrilla formations, military teams, detectives, secret bases, logistics, and a network of message carriers for coordination. Non-Adivasi Hindu castes also participated in the rebellion. Con tr i - bution of Women Phulo-Jhano, two sisters, led an army of 1,000 women who played crucial roles in the rebellion. The East India Company’s army was defeated twice during the uprising. End After the rebellion started, martial law was proclaimed by the East India Company which lasted until January 3, 1856, when martial law was suspended and the rebel- lion was eventually suppressed by the Pres- idency armies. www.insightsonindia.com9 Lasting Im- pact of the Hul The Santhal rebellion inspired future up- risings, such as the Santhal involvement in the 1857 mutiny. It symbolized resistance against British colonialism and laid the foundation for subsequent movements in Jharkhand.

About Ozone Layer: The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of Earth’s strato- sphere that absorbs most of the Sun›s ultraviolet radiation. It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the lower part of the stratosphere (15-35 Km above the surface of the earth) Key findings: •\t Montreal Protocol and its amendments are suc- cessful in eliminating up to 99% of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) (long-lived man-made chemicals which destroy the protective ozone layer) •\t It highlights the impact of climate change, which is slowing down the recovery process and affecting the lower atmosphere’s climate. •\t The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano (in the southern Pacific) in January 2022 increased water vapour content in the stratosphere, leading to reduced ozone in the lower stratosphere of the southern hemisphere. •\t This additional water vapour is expected to result in more polar stratospheric clouds, enhanced ozone depletion, and larger and longer-lasting “ozone holes” in the future. •\t It highlights the importance of monitoring and protecting the ozone layer due to its crucial role in shielding life on Earth from harmful solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NEWBORN GENOME-SEQUENC- ING Context: Newborn screening programmes are now in vogue in different countries, and have been deployed in India as well. What is Newborn genome sequencing? It is the process of analyzing the complete genetic informa- tion of a newborn baby. It involves sequencing the entire genome to identify any genetic variations or mutations that may be associated with specific diseases or conditions e.g., Sickle cell anemia, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome etc. www.insightsonindia.com10 Genome sequencing is figuring out the order of DNA nucle- otides, or bases, in a genome—the order of Adenine, Cyto- sine, Guanines, and Thymine that make up an organism’s DNA. Why is it important to sequence newborn genomes? There are 6,000 or so genetic diseases, of which around 3,500 diseases have been documented. Sequencing new- born genomes is important because it allows for early de- tection and diagnosis of genetic diseases, enabling timely interventions and treatments. •\t It provides valuable insights into the prevalence of genetic disorders and can help identify potential risks for future health issues. •\t Sequencing healthy newborn genomes can uncover unexpected genetic risks and enable better medical surveillance for personalized healthcare. Top of Form Programmes: •\t Human Genome Project (1990): an international re- search effort to determine the sequence of the hu- man genome and identify the genes that it contains. •\t Genome India Project Conclusion: Ethical challenges related to incidental findings, privacy, psychological impact, and equitable access need to be ad- dressed. With careful consideration, rapid whole-genome sequencing could become a standard procedure for detect- ing genetic disorders and shaping a healthier future for ev- ery child.

Mapping PANGONG TSO LAKE Both India and China have ramped up infrastructure devel- opment on the north bank of Pangong Tso Lake in eastern Ladakh and western Tibet. China is constructing a bridge to connect the north and south banks of the lake, while India is building a black-topped road on its side of the north bank. The ongoing tensions between the two sides have led to gridlock in Corps Commander-level talks, with remaining friction points at Depsang and Demchok. www.insightsonindia.com11 Pangong Tso is an endorheic lake (bodies of water that do not flow into an ocean or a sea) spanning eastern Ladakh and West Tibet situated at an elevation of 4,225 m.
