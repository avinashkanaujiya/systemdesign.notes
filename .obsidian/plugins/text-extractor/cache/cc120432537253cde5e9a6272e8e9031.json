About the Bill: Objective: In order to provide individuals or households with a minimal additional guaranteed income in the form of a guaranteed wage/pension, the bill would establish entitle- ment-based social security. Salient provisions: ● Minimum guaranteed income: ○ Each adult citizen of the state has been guar- anteed a minimum income for 125 days a year. ○ This will be provided through two schemes, ■ In the urban areas through the Ra- jasthan government’s flagship Indi- ra Gandhi Shahri Rozgar Guarantee Yojana. \t In the rural areas through the Ma- hatma Gandhi National Rural Em- ployment Guarantee Act (MGNRE- GA). ● Guaranteed employment: ○ The minimum wages should be paid weekly or in any case not later than a fortnight to ensure the right to employment. ○ The Program Officers (BDO in rural and an Executive Officer of the local body in ur- ban areas) shall ensure that the work site is within a radius of 5 Km of where the job card is registered. ○ The applicant is entitled to an unemploy- ment allowance if the program officer fails to offer work within 15 days of receiving the application. ● Guaranteed social security pension: The govern- ment will provide eligible categories (aged, disabled, widows, and single women) with a minimum pen- sion of Rs 1,000, which will be increased at the rate of 15% each year. Significance of the Bill: ● The Bill contains many firsts in the country. For ex- ample, guaranteeing minimum employment and pensions by law distinguishes it from cash transfer schemes. ● The Bill is part of a bouquet of schemes and mea- www.insightsonindia.com3 sures undertaken by the Rajasthan government to combat inflation with an eye on the polls later this year. Challenges towards implementation: ● Identification of eligible beneficiaries with mini- mum inclusion and exclusion errors. ● Financial burden, as the government anticipates an additional expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore per year, which may increase with time. Conclusion: ● The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members (Gandhiji). ● It is therefore a moral responsibility of every gov- ernment to ensure the welfare of vulnerable/ disad- vantaged people.

(15M) GS Paper 2 FROM GREAT POWERS TO ASIA - INDIA IS RAISING ITS DIPLOMAT- IC GAME Syllabus: International Relations Context: The Indian PM’s decision to stop in Cairo (Egypt) on his way back from Washington and Abu Dhabi (UAE) as he came home from Paris suggests India is looking for greater engagement in Africa, Asia and the waters (Indo-Pacific) that connect them. Other similar engagements: India’s External Affairs Minister is currently engaging (in Jakarta and Bangkok) with - ● The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASE- AN), ● The ASEAN “plus one” meeting, ● The East Asia Summit (EAS), ● The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ● The Forum for Mekong Ganga Cooperation (MGC), and ● The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Tech- nical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). The focus of these engagements: ● India’s neighbourhood figured prominently: ○ For example, the Indian PM and French President issued a declaration on the In- do-Pacific Roadmap for wide-ranging co- operation in countries of Africa, the Indian Ocean Region, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. ○ Similarly, the joint statement issued by the Indian PM and the US President included a section on the strategic collaboration in the Indo-Pacific through the Quad. ● To boost cooperation in bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral arrangements: Like the Indian Ocean Rim Association, the Indian Ocean Naval Sympo- sium, the Indian Ocean Commission, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, and the ASEAN-led institutions. Why are these engagements not business as usual in Indian diplomacy? ● India’s relations with its Asian neighbourhood since independence were treated as separate from Del- hi’s engagement with the great powers. ○ It was based on the proposition that India must keep the major powers out of the re- gion to create an “area of peace” in Asia. ○ However, Delhi neither had the power to stop the great powers from coming into the region nor prevent its Asian neighbours from aligning with outside powers. www.insightsonindia.com4 ● The main criterion for membership in the non- aligned movement (NAM) is that NAM members should not have deep military-strategic cooperation with great powers. Implications of these policies: ● Violated the essence of international politics - the sovereign will protect themselves with whatever resources s/he can mobilise and can’t put ideology ahead of survival. ● Delhi also ignored that most threats to a sovereign arise from problems with neighbours. When did things start changing? ● After the end of the Cold War and the new compul- sions on India to liberalise its economy. ● India’s new focus was on trade and investment and connectivity in relations with its neighbours in Asia that were long neglected. ● Delhi also broke the rule of keeping political dis- tance from the major powers. What led to recent changes in Indian diplomacy? ● Deterioration in India-China relations: ○ As a result, Delhi embraced the Indo-Pacific framework and the Quad initiated by Japan and supported by the US in East Asia. ○ To the West, India joined Israel, UAE, and the US to launch the so-called I2U2 forum. ○ India’s strategic partnership with the West- ern powers is rising compared to its engage- ment with Russia and China. Conclusion: ● Delhi now takes an integrated view of its interests and pursues them through new and cross-cutting forums (for example, the Quad and the ASEAN are seen as complementary to each other). ● As India becomes a major economic entity with sig- nificant geopolitical force, its ability to shape the intersection between its extended neighbourhood and the world will rapidly grow.

(UPSC 2022) GS Paper 3 A ROADMAP TO ELIMINATE POV- ERTY IN INDIA Syllabus: Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger/ Growth and development Context: India’s current per capita income is $2,379 in 2022- 23. The goal is to raise it by almost six times in the next 25 years, leading to a higher standard of living and poverty eradication. To achieve this vision, understanding the chal- lenges and taking appropriate actions are essential. Current achievements of India in poverty reduction: ● 415 million poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021 (from 645 to 230 million). (Global MPI) ● India has registered a decline in the number of mul- tidimensionally poor from 24.85% in 2015-16 to 14.96% in 2019-2021. (National MPI) Challenges that the country will face in economic develop- ment and subsequent poverty reduction: On the global front: ● Ukraine-Russia conflict: The overall climate for peace, which is necessary for growth, has deterio- rated after the conflict. ○ Supply disruptions of critical imports like oil can cause a severe setback not only to developing countries but also to developed countries. ● The attitude of some countries towards global trade: Rich countries that earlier preached to the developing countries to adopt a free trade model, are putting restrictions on imports. ○ This is happening when developing coun- tries like India are reaching the stage of be- ing able to compete in the world market. At the domestic: ● State of Indian economy: ○ In the past 75 years, India has built a reason- ably strong and diversified economy. ○ Though India is today the 5th largest econo- my, it is ranked (2022) 149 out of 194 coun- tries in per capita terms. ● Export-led growth strategy: Several countries (South Korea, China, etc) achieved high growth over several decades by focusing on exports. ○ This export-led growth strategy may not work for India, particularly in the context of a changed global trade situation. ● Adoption of new technologies: India’s ability to ab- sorb new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) www.insightsonindia.com5 will have ramifications for the industrial structure and employment. ○ AI can result in increasing productivity and output but not necessarily jobs. ● Impact on output because of environmental con- siderations: Bringing down pollution can have an output effect. In this context, a high annual growth rate of 8% may have to be ruled out. ● Provision for basic income: ○ In an uncertain world, the need for the pro- vision of basic income becomes even more urgent. ○ However, there are many issues connect- ed with basic income (level and coverage) which need to be resolved. Actions India needs to overcome these challenges: ● A multi-dimensional strategy: ○ The emphasis should be on agriculture and related activities, manufacturing and ex- ports. ○ India needs to preserve its achievements and move forward in the services area. ● Raising the per capita income: By almost six times from $2,379 in 2022-23 over the next 25 years. ● Reorienting the educational system: This will en- able students to acquire the required skills. ● Identify labour-intensive economic activities. ● For implementing the provision of basic income, beneficiaries have to be determined taking into ac- count certain normative considerations. Potential implications of the above actions: These will en- able people to have a higher standard of living, reduce in- equality and eliminate poverty. Conclusion: Despite challenges, a 6 to 7% sustained growth and better job prospects are still possible if the growth strat- egy is correct and if an appropriate investment climate can be created. Insta Links: National Multidimensional Poverty Index GS Paper 3 CHECKING INDISCRIMINATE USE OF GROUNDWATER FOR IRRIGA- TION Syllabus: Conservation, environmental pollution and deg- radation Context: There is a need to urgently address the pressure on groundwater resources, starting with irrigation water use. Groundwater situation in India: Concerns: ● India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, extracting more than the two largest econo- mies, the United States and China, together. ● Growing domestic, industrial and agricultural de- mand is increasing the stress on groundwater re- sources. For example, ○ India is dangerously falling under the cate- gory of a water-scarce country. ○ India gets 1,486 cubic metres (1 cubic me- tre = 1,000 litres) per capita of freshwater every year. ○ A country is officially water-scarce when the per capita availability is less than 1,000 cu- bic metres per annum. ● Climate change is adding to the problem and may have far-reaching implications, including threats to food security, increased conflicts and mass migra- tion, if not addressed timely. The Interplay between groundwater stress and Agriculture: ● Over 60% of irrigation requirements are met by groundwater. ○ Since the 1980s, around 77% of the total addition to irrigation in the northwestern plains has come from tubewells. ● This has introduced new crops (water-guzzlers) in non-traditional areas, for example, paddy in Punjab (the area under rice increased from 47 to 80% of the total cropped area between 1970s-2019) and Hary- ana. ● This has also increased cropping intensity by ex- panding cultivation in the largely dry winter and summer seasons. Implications of changing crop patterns: ● Created a crisis by depleting groundwater at an alarming rate and deteriorating soil-human health. ● Affecting crop diversity. For example, paddy in Pun- jab has practically wiped out oilseeds and pulses, maize and cotton. www.insightsonindia.com6 What is aiding this? Water and electricity policies (subsidy) are often considered the main drivers of growth in the area under rice. Way ahead: ● Storing and using rainwater: India receives 4,000 billion cubic metres (BCM) of freshwater annually through precipitation, but only 1,123 BCM is used currently. ● Effective management of surface water resources in regions where surface irrigation is available. ● Energy and water pricing can be an effective poli- cy remedy for diversifying cropping patterns and checking depleting groundwater. ○ However, this may be less effective, as farm- ers may switch to alternative energy sourc- es (solar pumping). ○ Also, irrigation water pricing in India is non-volumetric and mainly applies to ca- nal-sourced systems, depending on the area and type of crops grown. ● Encouraging farmers to sell surplus solar energy by increasing the tariff. ● Using water metres for irrigation water pricing to assess the actual volume of water used. This will en- courage water conservation through its efficient use. Insta Links: UN Groundwater Summit 2022 Content for Mains Enrichment TANKAI METHOD The Ministry of Culture and the Indian Navy have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to revive the ancient stitched shipbuilding method, also known as the Tankai method. What is Tankai Method? The Tankai method is an ancient shipbuilding technique that involves stitching wooden planks together to construct ships, rather than using nails. This method offers flexibility and durability to the ships, making them less susceptible to damage from shoals and sandbars. This 2000-year-old shipbuilding technique will be preserved and brought back to life. Significance: The revival of the stitched shipbuilding meth- od is vital for preserving India’s rich maritime heritage and cultural history. Furthermore, it aims to promote cultur- al memories and strengthen ties with Indian Ocean littoral countries. Usage: The example can be used in Essay/Indian Arts and Culture questions to showcase the exceptional craftsman- ship of traditional shipbuilders in India. Facts for Prelims ZOMBIE FIRES Context: As global temperatures rise, fires are spreading far- ther north and into the Arctic, leading to a rise in “zombie fires.” What are Zombie Fires? Zombie fires are underground wildfires that smoulder beneath the surface, burning slowly and releasing large amounts of smoke. They can persist through winter, re- emerging in the following spring. These fires are difficult to detect and extinguish, making them a challenging firefight- ing task. Zombie fires occur in carbon-rich peatlands and can have significant environmental impacts, contributing to climate change and air pollution. Reason for it: The Arctic’s warming conditions make the forest and tundra more susceptible to wildfires, and changes in atmospheric circulation, including more frequent lightning strikes, con- tribute to fire outbreaks. The increasing prevalence of zombie fires underscores the urgent need to address climate change and its impact on wildfire risks. Related Term: Zombie ice, also known as “polar ice zombie,” is a term used www.insightsonindia.com7 to describe Arctic or Antarctic ice that appears to be melting and disappearing during the warmer months but later reap- pears and refreezes during the colder months. However, the ice is no longer getting replenished by parent glaciers SOVEREIGN GREEN BONDS Context: The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) will allow pension funds to invest in sov- ereign green bonds that the government is expected to is- sue in the second half of the current financial year. What are Sovereign Green Bonds? Sovereign Green Bonds are government-issued bonds used to fund projects that have positive environmental impacts and contribute to sustainability goals. •\t It was announced in the Union Budget 2022-23 and the framework for SGrBs was issued by the Ministry of Finance in 2022. Investors in these bonds do not bear project-related risks. Last year, the government raised Rs 16,000 crore from the issuance of Sovereign Green Bonds to fund projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Currently, there are 10 pen- sion fund managers under the National Pension System, and the move aims to encourage investment in environmen- tally friendly projects. About PFRDA: Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (Statutory organization; founded 2003; HQ: New Delhi) is the regulatory body for the overall supervision and regula- tion of pensions in India. It operates under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. ADVANCE AUTHORISATION SCHEME Context: The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has implemented the Advance Authorisation Scheme under the Foreign Trade Policy, which allows duty-free import of inputs for export purposes. The eligibility of inputs is deter- mined by Sector-specific Norms Committees based on in- put-output norms. •\t To streamline the norms fixation process, the DGFT has created a user-friendly and searchable da- tabase of Ad-hoc Norms fixed in previous years. These norms can be used by any exporter without requiring a Norms Committee review, as outlined in the Foreign Trade Policy 2023. •\t This trade facilitation measure simplifies the ad- vance authorisation and norms fixation process, leading to shorter turnaround times for export- ers, improved ease of doing business, and reduced compliance burden. About Advance Authorization Scheme: •\t It allows the duty-free import of inputs, which are physically incorporated into an export product. •\t In addition to any inputs, packaging material, fuel, oil, and catalyst which is consumed/utilized in the process of production of export product, is also al- lowed. •\t DGFT provides a sector-wise list of Standard In- put-Output Norms (SION) under which the exporters may choose to apply. •\t Advance Authorization is valid for 12 months from the date of issue of such Authorization. BHOOMI SAMMAN” 2023 AWARDS Context: Recently, the President of India presented the “Bhoomi Samman” 2023 awards to State Secretaries and District Collectors along with their teams who excelled in achieving saturation of the core components of the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP). PLANT SPECIES THAT CAN WITH- STAND EXTREME DEHYDRATION Context: The Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in In- dia, is home to 62 Desiccation-Tolerant (DT) Vascular plant www.insightsonindia.com8 species, capable of surviving extreme dehydration by losing up to 95% of their water content and reviving when water becomes available again. •\t This unique ability allows them to thrive in harsh, arid environments that would be unsuitable for most other plants. These DT plants have poten- tial applications in agriculture, especially in wa- ter-scarce regions. Key Findings: •\t The study highlights that DT plants are predomi- nantly found in rock outcrops, a common landscape feature in the Western Ghats, but they also inhabit tree trunks in partially shaded forests. •\t Of the 62 species identified, 16 are exclusive to In- dia, and 12 are unique to the Western Ghats out- crops, emphasizing the area’s significance as a global DT hotspot. AIRBUS C-295AIRCRAFT Context: Airbus and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) are working together to establish an aircraft manufacturing facility in Vadodara (Gujarat). Under a ₹22,000-crore deal with the Indian Air Force, 56 C-295MW transport aircraft will be procured to replace the Avro aircraft. Of these, 16 aircraft will be manufac- tured in Spain, and 40 will be produced in India by Airbus and Tata jointly. •\t This is the first time a private sector company would be manufacturing a full aircraft in India. About C-295: The C-295 is a modern transport aircraft with a capacity of 9 tonnes and can carry up to 71 troops or 50 paratroopers. It has a flight endurance of up to 11 hours, enabling multi- role operations in all weather conditions. It will replace the Indian Air Force’s ageing Avro-748 planes, which are British-origin twin-engine turboprops with a 6-tonne freight capacity. Mapping SWEDEN Protesters in Baghdad, Iraq, stormed the Swedish Embassy in response to an anticipated Koran-burning event in Stock- holm, Sweden. Sweden’s laws protect the right to hold pub- lic demonstrations, and blasphemy laws were abandoned in the country in the 1970s. Recently, Turkey removed its objec- tion to Sweden joining NATO. Sweden is a Scandinavian nation with thousands of coast- al islands and inland lakes, along with vast boreal forests and glaciated mountains. It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by abridge–tunnel across the Öresund. EAST AFRICA CRUDE OIL PIPELINE (EACOP) PROJECT The East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project, connect- ing the Tilenga and Kingfisher oilfields in western Uganda with the port of Tanga in eastern Tanzania, has raised con- cerns over its impact on ecosystems and exacerbating the global climate crisis. The pipeline’s construction will disrupt sensitive ecosystems, including Uganda’s Murchison Falls National Park and the Murchison Falls-Albert Delta Ramsar site.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
