Nath Paper 2 Indian Anthropology – T ribal India Nadeem Hasnain, Indian Anthropology Nadeem Hasnain, Muniratnam Printed material, Braintree I did not cover these books from cover to cover . I’ve selectively read them based on the topics mentioned in Syllabus. I would suggest having one material/source as a base and then just extracting information/examples/case studies/diagrams regarding that topic from other books in case the content for that topic needs to be enriched. As long as you can cover the entire syllabus, which books or how many books you follow will not make much dif ference in my opinion . T o get that extra edge in marks, I would strongly suggest focusing on answer presentation instead of reading more and more books. Answer Presentation As in GS, what ultimately translates into marks is how you present your answer to the examiner . With the same content/knowledge, some would get more marks in the exam due to better presentation. The reason for my good marks in Anthropology in CSE 2014(271 marks) and CSE 2015(275 marks) is due to focus on presenting the same content or knowledge that everyone else had in a better manner . I found this article by RajaGopal Sunkara extremely useful and I followed the tips given in the article religiously . https://sykobanerises.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/anthropology-by-raja-gopal-sunkara-air- 49/ 2 /1 0 I’ve made the following broad changes in my answers that I think made the dif ference Side headings : As RajaGopal opined in the above article, they give structure to your answer and makes your answer more readable, presentable and likeable. I had side heads for all the questions (10/15/20 marks) Diagrams : I’ve attempted questions in the exam that had scope of diagrams/flow charts in them. That included more physical anthropology questions. And also wherever possible I drew diagrams/ figures. T ry to include flow charts/ diagrams/ figures/ maps etc. in as many answers as possible. They’re sure to make your answers look better and these small incremental changes in my opinion make a huge difference in your marks. I’ve come across this list of diagrams somewhere: Case studies : In paper 2, there are many questions, which are very generic, which can be asked in GS1. T o make your answers dif ferent from GS answers, a friend of mine suggested writing case studies for such questions. I’ve collected case studies for all generic topics in paper-2 and quoted them in my answer . Instead of quoting many case studies in a single sentence in your answer , I had case study as a separate side heading in the end under which I elaborated. This case study would occupy approx. 1/4 1/3 of my answer . Have case studies ready for all the generic topics in the Paper-2 so that you can readily quote them on questions on the day of exam. Also have case studies ready for all the generic questions in paper-2 from previous year chapter wise question papers. That’ll also ensure that you have structure ready for all probable questions. Case studies could be picked up from internet/ Nadeem Hasnain/ Newspaper (V edanta POSCO for FRA) I’ve mentioned the topics for which case studies are to be collected and some case studies in this link . Examples/ Definitions/ Studies : For questions on marriage/family/kinship etc., it’ s important to remember a few definitions given by famous thinkers. For questions on socio-cultural anthropology , make a note of examples of tribes you come across while reading (Law and Justice/ dif ferent types of descent groups/ Forms of exchange etc. Studies by famous anthropologist can be quoted. For eg. Paulin kolendas made some observations on Joint Family . Incorporating all these in your answer , in my opinion, would definitely give you that extra edge. Following Chapter W ise Previous Y ear Question Paper is a must . I used to do all the value additions mentioned above to the previous year questions. Instead of just going through syllabus and reading books, following previous year question papers will channelize your ef forts and help in making structured and enriched answers. So, instead of just reading a particular topic, doing those questions will help you make specific value additions (side heads, flow charts, diagrams, examples, case studies etc.) to the answer you’ll otherwise miss in reading. th – rd 3 /1 0 V alue additions on some questions 1 . Paleolithic Culture (10 marks, CSE-15) – Age, Culture, Geographical distribution, Tools could be side heads. Draw maps under geographical distribution and tools 2 .

T oday almost 95% Nagas,99% Mizos,80% Khasis,94% Garos have embraced Christianity . Have the tribals of north-east lost their identities? The answer is both yes and no. Those who embraced Christianity , they have lost their nature-centric religion, but they have gain a lot in some other way . In other words, the tribals of north-east have immensely benefited by embracing Christianity . Christian missionaries not only converted them but also set up the best English medium schools, colleges, dispensaries, hospitals and other charitable homes. The numbers of civil servants, university and college teachers, engineers, doctors etc. are increasing day by day . The Bonda tribe of Orissa till yesterday didn’t have a matriculate. Only recently the student from Bonda tribe passed matriculation compared with the number of North East tribals in universities.
