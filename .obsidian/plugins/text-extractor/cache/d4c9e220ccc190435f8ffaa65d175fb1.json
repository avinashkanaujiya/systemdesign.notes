INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context Article 19 of the Constitution: It guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, and is invoked against the state. Article 19(1) in The Constitution Of India 1949, All citizens shall have the right: (a) to freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; and (f) to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Article 19(2) in The Constitution of India 1949: Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) s hall af fect the operation of any existing law , or prevent the State from making any law , in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause: in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the State friendly relations with foreign States public order , decency or morality In relation to contempt of court, defamation Incitement to an of fense. What Karnataka High Court said? 2 /4 The High Court admonished T witter for not complying with the orders. It imposed an astounding cost of ₹ 50 lakh on T witter. Issues with the judgment: The judgment undermines the right to free speech and expression It paves the way for the state to exercise unchecked power while taking down content without following established procedure. It exhibits a new trend to hinder digital rights and the exercise of free speech on the grounds of the dissemination of false speech. Section 69A of the Information T echnology Act, 2000: It empowers the state to issue blocking orders in cases of emergency on the grounds such as: “sovereignty and integrity of India defense of India security of the State friendly relations with foreign States public order for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable of fense relating to the above”. The Information T echnology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 (Blocking Rules) lays down the procedure for any blocking order issued under Section 69A. Judicial stand before: Shreya Singhal vs Union of India: The Supreme Court upheld the validity of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules. Court said: Sufficient procedural safeguards were embedded. such as: Provision of recording a reasoned order Providing notice to the intermediary and the originator whose content was sought to be blocked. Karnataka High Court: It held that observations in Shreya Singhal cannot be construed to mean providing notice to the users of the content Even if reasons are recorded in writing, they may not be conveyed to the user . Issues : 3 /4 This runs contrary to judicial precedent : In the absence of procedural safeguards. The restrictions that are to be imposed on free speech c an be implemented without any oversight or without giving any recourse to the af fected entity to challenge them. This translates into unfettered power b eing exercised by the state in taking down content. High Court Observation: While the High Court has acknowledged t hat blocking orders af fect the rights of users. It held that the state could exercise its discretion to hear users and that issuance of notice under Rule 8 w as not mandatory . It observed that users of T witter were not “downtrodden” or did not “suf fer from some handicap” that prevented them from accessing the appropriate remedies available to them. The High Court held that claims of users whose tweets or accounts were blocked could not be espoused by T witter and that none of the af fected users had approached the High Court. Issues with Court’ s claim: The observation is false as the human rights activist and author(whose T witter account had been blocked: He had filed an application to intervene in the case. His application was refused by the High Court. The view of the High Court that users need to be identified for notice to be given. T witter must provide this information divorced from reality when it comes to application of the Blocking Rules. MeitY routinely cites the confidentiality requirement under Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules to deny blocking orders to originators of content. Obtaining blocking orders becomes a difficult task: Even when requested through the Right to Information process, and even if the originator identifies themselves. High Court’ s reason: The content could lead to the spread of “fake news” and “misinformation”, which had the potential to disturb “public order” and threaten the “security of the State”. Analysis of High Court’ s reason: Misinformation and fake news are not grounds under which free speech can be restricted under Article 19(2) and Section 69A. 4 /4 The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that for speech to be prejudicial to maintenance of public order There must be a direct link between the speech and the potential threat to public order . The High Court is convinced that these blocking orders are “well-reasoned”, even though no nexus can be established with public order and the security of the state. Free speech: Reasonable restrictions on the fundamental right to freedom of speech can only be instituted on the basis of eight specifically enumerated grounds under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court had clarified in Shreya Singhal that blocking under Section 69A and the Blocking Rules must conform to those grounds only . W ay Forward This reliance on dissemination of false information to obstruct digital rights and free speech has been witnessing a rise. Disproportionate Internet shutdown orders , such as the ones currently operating in Manipur , are routinely issued to curb this spread of false speech and misinformation. The trend to restrict fundamental rights with the “fake news” rhetoric is reminiscent of the oft-cited rhetoric of the state invoking national security to justify laws that are excessive and arbitrary . The High Court rejected T witter ’s contention that Section 69A only permits the blocking of specific tweets. Brij Bhushan And Another vs The State Of Delhi: The Supreme Court held that pre-censorship on freedom of speech is unconstitutional. Such a digital prior-restraint has the potential of inducing a chilling ef fect on the freedom of speech of online platform users. The Karnataka High Court’ s judgment subverts the procedural safeguards that must be employed while restricting the freedom of speech. It erodes the principles of natural justice which dictate for the af fected party to be allowed to present their case to the best of their abilities. Along with the recently amended IT Rules on fact-checking, the judgment has the dangerous potential of reposing untrammeled power in the State to remove any content that it deems to be unfavorable.
