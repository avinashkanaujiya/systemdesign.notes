AR TICLE HIGHLIGHTS Recognising the need to switch from the ‘take-make-dispose ’ to ‘r educe-r euse-r ecycle’ model, India has prioritized ‘Resour ce Efficiency and Cir cular Economy’ as one of the thr ee cor e themes for deliberations in th e G-20 forum. INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context G20: The G20 is an informal gr oup : 19 countries and the Eur opean Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the W orld Bank. The G20 Pr esidency r otates annually: according to a system that ensures a regional balance over time. For the selection of the pr esidency : 19 countries are divided into 5 groups, each having no more than 4 countries . The presidency rotates between each group. Every year the G20 selects a country from another group to be president. India is in Gr oup 2 which also has Russia, South Africa, and T urkey. The G20 does not have a permanent secretariat or Headquarters. Cir cular Economy: 2 /4 It is often known as “ cir cularity” . It is an economic system that addresses issues including pollution, waste, biodiversity loss, and climate change. A cir cular economy emphasizes the 3 R’ s (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) as well as material refurbishment, recovery , and repair . Cir cular economy is focused on boosting pr oduction through resource consumption that is more ef fective and hence has the least negative ef fect on the environment. Sustainability serves as the foundation for all aspects of production, consumption, and design. Resour ce efficiency and cir cular economy are powerful strategies that can ef fectively minimize dependence on natural resources It can curtail waste and encourage sustainable design practices G20 Countries: Most G-20 member countries have committed to net zer o ambitions and are working to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In order to ensur e gr owing r esour ce consumption in an environmentally responsible manner , there is also a need to raise the current recycling rates of 15%-25%. Priority ar eas for India in the cir cular economy during its G-20 pr esidency: Circularity in the steel sector; Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Circular bioeconomy Establishing an industry-led resource ef ficiency and circular economy industry coalition. Cir cular steel sector The demand for stee l is poised to grow especially in growing economies such as India. Globally , about 7% of energy sector emission is attributed to iron and steel production. How to tackle steel sector emissions? Ensuring collaboration among the G-20 member countries for knowledge sharing, technology co-development and technology transfer . The pr esidency document for knowledge exchange on the ‘Circular Economy in the Steel Sector ’ is a potential blueprint for a net zero pathway for the steel industry , reducing resource 3 /4 utilization and minimizing wastage. EPR framework: Under India’s G-20 pr esidency, there is an emphasis on the significance of the EPR framework in integrating circularity throughout the value chain. Differ ent countries have implemented differ ent EPR models, it is necessary that G-20 member-countries share best practices to accelerate the transition to a circular economy . Effective implementation of EPR plays a pivotal role in promoting the growth of the recycling infrastructure and establishing a streamlined waste collection system. Centralized EPR portal: W ith over 20,000 r egister ed Pr oducers, Importers, and Brand Owners (PIBOs) and over 1,900 plastic waste processors on the centralized EPR portal India boasts o ne of the lar gest frameworks for EPR. India has also notified compr ehensive rules for e-waste and battery waste management. Bio wastes: Since 1970, the consumption of biological r esour ces in G-20 member countries has risen 5(two point five)times . Biowaste such as municipal and industrial waste and agricultural residue has become a global issue It causes pollution, biodiversity loss and global warming. Combined with cr ops well-suited for degraded lands , biowaste can serve as valuable primary raw materials and viable substitutes for mineral resources. Adopting a cir cular bioeconomy appr oach will reduce the need for extracting vir gin resources and provide an ef fective waste disposal solution. Steps by the government: The Government has been working towards the adoption of biofuels. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana provides financial support to integrated bio-ethanol projects to set up second generation (2G) ethanol projects. 2G bioethanol technology produces bioethanol from waste feedstock such as crop residues and municipal solid waste that would otherwise have no value. India has also made it mandatory for coal-burning thermal power plants to use a 5% blend of biomass pellets along with coal. The Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agr o Resour ces (GOBAR) Dhan scheme was launched to convert cattle dung and other or ganic waste into compost, biogas, and biofuels to promote sustainable agriculture and reduce pollution. The scheme has helped create rural livelihoods and ensured improved sanitation. The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable T ransportation (SA T A T) Scheme(2018) to promote the use of Compressed BioGas (CBG) as an alternative green transportation fuel. It has aided the bioenergy sector by accelerating the development of infrastructure for the production, storage and distribution of CBG. W ay Forward In the collective global endeavor to ensur e sustainable development and realize the Sustainable Development Goals, decoupling resource utilization from economic growth is going to be the key . Industries ar e crucial in advancing r esour ce efficiency and cir cular economy practices , India has envisioned an industry coalition in these areas. The coalition will aim to achieve enhanced technological collaboration build advanced capabilities across sectors mobilize de-risked finance 4 /4 facilitate a proactive private sector engagement. Global platforms such as the G-20 play an important r ole in addr essing key issues and presenting solutions by adopting a collaborative approach. Resour ce efficiency and cir cular economy have emerged as key solutions in collective efforts in tackling triple planetary challenges. India’s G-20 pr esidency has focused extensively on these appr oaches which of fer promising pathways towards a more sustainable and resilient future. QUESTION FOR PRACTICE Do you think India will meet 50 per cent of its energy needs fr om r enewable energy by 2030? Justify your answer. How will the shift of subsidies fr om fossil fuels to r enewables help achieve the above objective? Explain.(UPSC 2022) (200 WORDS, 10 MARKS)","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
