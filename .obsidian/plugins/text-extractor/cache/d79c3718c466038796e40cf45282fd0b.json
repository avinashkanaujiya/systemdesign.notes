INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE Context Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN): It is a r egional organization which was established to promote political and social stability amid rising tensions among the Asia-Pacific’ s post-colonial states. The motto of ASEAN is “One V ision, One Identity , One Community”. August 8th is observed as ASEAN Day . ASEAN Secr etariat – Indonesia, Jakarta. Recent Developments between ASEAN and India: The 24th ASEAN-India Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) was hosted in Delhi. India and ASEAN celebrated the 30th anniversary of their Dialogue Relations. In the 2nd ASEAN Digital Ministers’ (ADGMIN) Meeting with India , the two sides finalized India-ASEAN Digital work plan 2022 for future collaboration in the field. 2 /3 What ar e the Fundamental Principles of ASEAN? The ASEAN fundamental principles, as contained in the T reaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (T AC) of 1976 Mutual r espect for the independence, sovereignty , equality , territorial integrity , and national identity of all nations. The right of every State t o lead its national existence free from external interference, subversion or coercion. Non-interfer ence in the internal af fairs of one another . Settlement of differ ences or disputes in a peaceful manner . Renunciation of the thr eat or use of force. Effective cooperation among themselves. V ision: The joint communiqué of the FMM: It is indicative of ASEAN’ s brave attempts to navigate through transformative changes in the present decade As the curr ent chair, Indonesia has portrayed ASEAN as “the Epicentrum of Growth”. It is a well-chiseled vision with three interrelated dimensions: Cr eating a political community that ensures regional peace and just democratic and harmonious environment An economic community focused on achieving a well-integrated and connected regional economy within the global economic system A socio-cultural community to enhance the quality of life of ASEAN’ s citizens as well as sustainable development of the region. ASEAN’ s ability to manage r egional and global dynamics depended on two critical ingr edients(Minister for For eign Affairs of Indonesia and chair): It should maintain its cr edibility b y adhering to the ASEAN Charter It should stay in the driver ’s seat while navigating regional dynamics. Challenges : ASEAN’ s internal differ ences on issues such as Myanmar keep surfacing in public. Its desir e to lead the r egion and shape its agenda stands jeopardized by the strained relationship between the U.S. and China. China enjoys close political and economic r elations with the ASEAN states , and at least three of them, i.e Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar , are its virtual dependencies. Philippines has become mor e assertive in its claims in the South China Sea The central players, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapor e and Thailand, are all favorably disposed towards China. Most of the ASEAN countries do not raise their voice against China’ s delaying tactics in negotiating an enforceable code of conduct concerning the South China Sea. ASEAN and China have called for “an early conclusion of an effective and substantive” code of conduct No indication of a timeline is given. ASEAN also watches helplessly t he acrimonious debate between the U.S. and Chinese governments, despite USA ’s recent attempts to revive constructive discussions through high-level visits. Despite ASEAN partners r eaffirming support for the AOIP , its actual implementation remains a worry . It appears vulnerable when the gr ouping is unable to forge unity on a most sensitive issue, the Myanmar situation, which has led ASEAN to bar a member -state (Myanmar) from all its political-level discussions. 3 /3 In the run-up to the FMM, Thailand, defying ASEAN’ s of ficial policy , ran its own dialogue with the military government of Myanmar . ASEAN pr efers to pr omote the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP): Its four identified areas: maritime cooperation connectivity UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 economic cooperation W ay Forward Institutional ar chitectur e cr eated by ASEAN has become an inclusive platform. It draws nations fr om near and far, as also all major players (the United States, China, India, Japan and Russia) engaged in shaping the strategic contestation in a vast region stretching from east Africa to the South Pacific. The disunity could not be concealed by a r outine r eaffirmation of the Five-Point Consensus (5PC) f or ged in April 2021. W ithout unity, A SEAN centrality loses much of its credibility . External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar : He referred to the importance of a “strong and unified” ASEAN in the emer ging dynamic of the Indo-Pacific. He highlighted the convergence between the AOIP and India’ s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative. To build on the compr ehensive strategic partnership between India and ASEAN, the two sides work in “newer areas such as cyber , financial and maritime security domains. Though it appear ed that ASEAN did not make much pr ogr ess, and no new ground was broken, its persistence with dialogue, internally and externally , prevented geopolitical temperatures from rising.
