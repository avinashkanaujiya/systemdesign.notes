Making Cancer Drugs Affordable Introduction • The subject of the spiralling costs of cancer medicines and their implications were highlighted in a recent report (“Cancer Care Plan and Management”) by the Rajya Sabha’s Standing Committee on Health. • According to the WHO Constitution, “enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being”. Rising costs of Cancer care • The Committee noted that “about 40% of cancer hospitalization cases are financed mainly through borrowings, sale of assets and contributions from friends and relatives”. • Even average out-of-pocket spending on cancer care is too high. • Spending for cancer care in private facilities is about three times that of public facilities. • WHO report highlighted that the cost of a course of standard treatment for early-stage positive breast cancer would be equivalent to about 10 years of average annual wages in India. • The costs associated with other medical care and supportive care would make overall care even more unaffordable. Impact on survival rates • The catastrophic treatment cost has seriously impacted survival rates in developing countries. • In breast cancer, the five-year survival rates in India and South Africa are estimated to be 65% and 45%, respectively. • In contrast, in high-income countries, it is nearly 90%. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS The justifications by pharma companies • Large pharmaceutical companies cite that they spend over $3 billion in bringing a new molecule to the market, which they must recoup in order to remain in the market for innovation. • WHO report mentioned above observed that spending on research and development may bear little or no relationship to how pharmaceutical companies set cancer medicine prices. • Another factor that allows the companies to sustain their high profit margins is intellectual property protection. • Through this companies can exercise monopoly control over their products. Concerns / Challenges • The lack of access to these critical medicines has pushed the life of patients and their families into deep financial stress. • It has also jeopardised their right to live with dignity, a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Supreme Court’s Interpretation • The Supreme Court of India has interpreted the right to life as the most precious human right. • The Court has, in several judgments interpreted the right to health as an extension of the right to life under Article 21. Way Forward • Authorising Indian companies to domestically produce high-priced cancer medicines. • Granting compulsory licences (CLs) in keeping with Sections 84 and 92 of the Patents Act. • The Government can invoke provisions of Section 100 of the Patents Act, which empowers it to authorise any entity to use a patented invention without the authorisation of the patent holder.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
