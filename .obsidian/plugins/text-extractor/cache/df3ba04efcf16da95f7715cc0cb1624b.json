Especially “Why?” Today I’m talking about why we should throw out the 5 Why’ s Method out and use the 5W1H method instead. If you’re not familiar with the 5 Why’ s Method, I’ll break it down: 5 Why’ s is the practice of asking why repeatedly (5 times, in fact) whenever a problem is encountered. Y ou do this to get beyond the obvious symptoms and discover the root cause. It’s a popular tool for root cause analysis and I’ve used it many times to shape many data analyses. It works remarkably well. But there is a better way to interrogate your data, and it is called the 5W1H method (also known as the Kipling method). I like this 5W1H method better than the 5 Why’ s because it helps me remember to think more broadly when I’m analyzing an issue. And it’ s easy to remember . It goes: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? It is a more flexible approach for analysis because the questions you ask will be largely dependent on what you’re analyzing, what problem you’re trying to solve, or what goal you have. I wrote a lot more about this in a recent edition of my weekly newsletter , Health Data Guru. So where do you start? This framework can be applied in any area where an analysis or strategy is being developed. I work exclusively in the healthcare and community equity space, and I have used this method across the board: population health studies, medical economics/financial planning, developing new targeted initiatives, designing process improvements, etc. It can be hard to know where to start, so I made a starter bank of example questions for you. 2 /4 Below is a list of example questions to consider when developing an analysis using this framework. These examples are focused on the health and program design domain, so they may not apply to your specific issue at hand. But they could easily be modified and are meant to serve as a starting point. Who? Who is most positively impacted by [the issue at hand]? Who is most negatively impacted by [the issue at hand]? Who is going to be disproportionately impacted? Who is going to benefit the most? The least? Who are we most trying to [help/support/save/identify/reach/etc.]? Who is going to unexpectedly fall through the cracks of your analysis, programs, or product/tool? Who is going to unexpectedly benefit? Who are the main cohorts or people that are driving/contributing to [the issue at hand]? Who is the most likely to [keep doing something/stop doing something/not know how to do something/refuse to do something]? What? What is the driving motivating factor for new or changing [behavior or issue at hand]? What are the biggest barriers or unforeseen risks we might encounter? What are the unstated assumptions we’re using going into this? What additional assumptions should we make/challenge/throw out? What are the key characteristics/behaviors of the [thing that we’re examining]? What are the worst/likely/or best-case scenarios to consider? What is the thing they all have in common/or don’t? What is the problem we’re actually trying to solve, the ultimate goal we have by doing this analysis, or the question(s) we’re actually trying to answer? What other sources of data might help inform this story? What is my data not inherently capturing? What are my blind spots? What other questions are our [stakeholders/customers/patients/executives] going to ask in regard to this? Where? Where do we need to target our ef forts? Where do the people/things/processes tend to go/live/travel to or from/take place/occur? Where has this been done before? Where has it never been done? Where are we likely to have the most success? The least? Where do we need to make the biggest ef fort or change in order to have the biggest impact? When? 3 /4 When is the best time of day/month/season? The worst? When or under what circumstances is this most likely to happen? When does it tend to occur more? Less? When is the best time to [do something] given all the external factors at play (economics, politics, other programs being deployed, bandwidth, etc.)? When has this happened before? When can we expect it to happen again? When is the exact point of no return/diminishing return/breaking point/threshold/etc.? Why? (note: this is an excellent time to also throw in a 5 Why) Why is this happening or not happening? Why are people going to be disproportionately impacted (is there any kind of inequity , disparity , disadvantage, privilege, assumed understanding, or other limitation?) Why are the people/things/processes acting/behaving/turning out the way they are? Why are people/things/processes changing? Why is the data telling us what it is telling us (does it have any bias, assumptions built in, etc.)? Why isn’t [something] working how we thought it would? Why wouldn’t it work? Why do people/things/processes do what they do (is it random, predictable, incentivized, misaligned, etc.)? Why has no one noticed this before? Why have we not done anything about it in the past? How? How can we address this? How can we learn from this? How will we know when this [program/improvement/initiative] is a success? How will we measure the progress or outcomes? How will we ensure continued engagement/improvement? How could we change [something] in order to produce the results we want? How do we reach the people most in need? How do we prevent people from falling through the cracks/taking advantage of the system? How do we know this will make a dif ference? How will we measure it? How will we collect the data we need? How will you design this dif ferently than what you may have done in the past, knowing what you know now or based on what you discovered? How can you design it so it “meets people where they’re at?” How do you make it equally accessible/customized/personalized? These are just a few examples and there are countless more. 4 /4 Asking these types of questions within the 5W1H framework can lead to better thought out analyses, understanding more about the issue at hand, and being more strategic when it comes to making decisions or planning new initiatives.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
