Militar y Adminis- tration Organized disciplined and efficient army; Paid soldiers in cash, chiefs through jagir grants (Sa- ranjam or Mokasa); had Infantry, Cavalry, and Navy Contribu- tions Shivaji revived Hindu traditions and promoted Marathi and Sanskrit; Established India’s first navy; Competent civil rule; Innovative military tactics (pioneering non-conventional meth- ods (guerrilla warfare)); Cared for people’s well-being S t ep s Taken in His Hon- our INS Shivaji and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus named after him; Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Ma- haraj Memorial National Committee; Shivaji festival started by Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1895) Significance of Raigarh Fort: Celebrations of the 350th anniversary of the coronation are being held at Raigad Fort in Maharashtra. At this fort, Shivaji was coronated in 1674. Here, he laid the foundation of “Hindavi-Swaraj” or the self-rule of Hin- du people and also took the title Chhatrapati. It is a hill fort situated about 25 km from Mahad in Raigad district and Early Europeans called it the Gibraltar of the East. Fort overlooks an artificial lake known as ‘Ganga Sagar Lake’. Shivaji was cremated at the fort in 1680. Ethical learnings from his life: •\t Responsible Use of Power: Shivaji demonstrated re- sponsible use of power by serving the people’s inter- ests and exemplifying the rule of the people. •\t Respect for Diversity: Shivaji respected diversity by promoting the usage of local languages and tradi- tions, and by maintaining a genuinely secular rule. •\t Courage and Determination: Shivaji’s bravery and determination in facing larger and more powerful enemies teach us the importance of courage in over- coming challenges. •\t Care for the Downtrodden: Shivaji cared for the downtrodden and farmers, highlighting the signifi- cance of empathy and compassion towards all mem- bers of society. •\t Ethical Leadership: Shivaji’s focus on the well-being of his people and his adherence to ethical principles showcase the importance of ethical leadership in governance. Conclusion: Shivaji Maharaj was a legendary Maratha warrior king who left a lasting impact on Indian history. His legacy continues to inspire generations, serving as a reminder of the virtues of justice, valour, and compassion. Insta Links: Marathas Mains Links: Q.

Case of China: ● China’s youth population has been declining and the ageing population, rising. ● In 2023, ~12 million students in China are expected to graduate. Challenges faced by China: ● China is facing a new kind of epidemic: joblessness. ● The job market was hit hard by the Covid-19 lock- downs and massive layoffs in key sectors such as real estate, tech, and education. ● Growing demand for job security and lack of em- ployment opportunities. What went wrong with China’s job market? The country’s growth was hit hard due to Zero Covid Policy. Scenario in India: Poor education, joblessness, and a short- age of skilled personnel. Impact: ● Undocumented migration. ● The increasing rate of crimes: India has become a hub for internet-based scams. What went wrong in India? ● 2,500+ Industrial Training Institutes: Established in the 1960s have failed to update their skilling cours- es. ● The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC): Created in 2003, NSDC’s short-duration courses (<1 year) are insufficient for real skill acqui- sition. ● Sub-standard engineering colleges: Mostly function as money-making enterprises, giving inadequate training. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and jobs: ● The NEP 2020 introduced vocational training for 6th, 7 th, and 8th-grade students to improve their skills in a particular field. ● This has to continue at the secondary level, with vo- cation-focused schools. What are the solutions? ● Job creation should be the topmost priority. ● Skilling, to effective outcome levels, should be the constant goal. ● The NEP vision should lead to a different kind of high school that continue with skilling training. ● MSMEs should be further incentivised as the major employment creators. ● India must add to its inherent IT capabilities with- out neglecting the manufacturing sector. Best practice - The German model of skill development: It comprised two strictly separate sectors: the higher educa- tion system and the system of dual (at the company level and classes at a vocational school) vocational education and training. Conclusion: Currently, India is taking minimal benefits of demograph- ic dividends. In order to take full benefits of demographic dividends, high-quality jobs need to be created and highly skilled youths need to fill these jobs. Insta Links: Decoding India’s population conundrum IMPACT OF CYCLONES ON THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON Context: The article discusses the impact of cyclones on the onset of the monsoon season and how global warming is affecting this relationship. What are Tropical Cyclones? Tropical cyclones are powerful storms that form over warm ocean waters near the equator. They are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and a well-defined centre called the eye. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 10 Positive Impact of Tropical Cyclones on the Monsoon: Positive Impact Example Accelerates the onset of the monsoon If a cyclone lies further north in the Bay of Bengal, the back winds blowing from the southwest to the northeast can pull the monsoon trough forward, and assist in the mons Brings large quantities of moisture South-westerly winds associated with tropical cyclones over the Arabian Sea bring ample moisture onto the Indian subcontinent, enhancing the monsoon rainfall. Negative Impact of Tropical Cyclones on the Monsoon: Negative Impact Example Disrupts the mon- soon trough Some cyclones in the North Indian Ocean can pull the monsoon trough forward or delay its progression, af- fecting the overall monsoon rainfall e.g., Cyclone Biparjoy. Alters wind pat- terns Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal can cause winds to turn around, inhibit- ing the northward progression of the monsoon winds over the region. Creates uncertain- ty Unfavourable tropical cyclone activ- ity and its associated atmospheric and oceanic effects can introduce uncertainty in the monsoon season, making it difficult to predict its be- haviour accurately. Impact of Global Warming on the Formation of Cyclones and the Monsoon Season: Impact Description Increased frequency and intensity of cy- clones Both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal have warmed by more than 1º C in the pre-monsoon season. Changes in monsoon onset, withdrawal, and rainfall patterns Global warming influences the timing and duration of the mon- soon season, leading to altered monsoon onset and withdrawal dates. Disruption of atmo- spheric and oceanic circulation patterns Global warming affects atmo- spheric and oceanic circulation patterns, such as the ‘atmo- spheric bridge’ from the Arctic and the ‘oceanic tunnel’ from the Southern Ocean, which can impact the monsoon dynamics. Increase in extreme weather events Severe storms and rainfall events cause flash floods, mudslides, and infrastructure damage. Impact of El Nino Global warming intensifies the impact of El Nino on the Indian Monsoon, resulting in less than average rainfall. The ‘Onset of the Monsoon’: The onset of the monsoon over the Kerala coast marks the beginning of the southwest monsoon season in India, which lasts from June to September and provides more than 70% of the country’s annual rainfall. IMD criteria for the onset of the monsoon: •\t Rainfall: The onset is declared if at least 60% of 14 designated meteorological stations in Kerala and Lakshadweep record at least 2.5 mm of rain for two consecutive days at any time after May 10. •\t Wind field: The IMD says that the depth of wester- lies should be up to 600 hectopascal (1 hPa is equal to 1 millibar of pressure) in the area that is bound by the equator to 10ºN latitude, and from longitude 55ºE to 80ºE. •\t Heat: The INSAT-derived Outgoing Longwave Radia- tion (OLR) value should be below 200 watts per sq m (wm2) in the area between the 5ºN and 10ºN lat- itudes, and 70ºE and 75ºE longitudes. o The outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) value is a measure of the energy emitted to space by the Earth’s surface, oceans, and at- mosphere. Impact of early or late monsoon on the volume of rainfall? The northward progression of the monsoon depends on various factors and can vary regionally. Consequently, early onset or late onset does not impact the volume of monsoon rain, as the timing of the onset does not directly correlate with the overall quality or amount of rainfall. What is Atmospheric Bridge? It is a connection in the Earth’s atmosphere that allows the Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 11 exchange of air and weather elements between distant re- gions. •\t E.g., The connection between the Arctic region and the Indian subcontinent through the atmosphere can influence the Indian monsoon by affecting wind patterns and moisture transport, potentially impact- ing the timing and intensity of the monsoon rains. •\t Another example of an atmospheric bridge is the phenomenon known as the “Pineapple Express” in the USA What is Oceanic Tunnel? It refers to a connection or pathway between two distant re- gions in the Ocean that allows the exchange of water, heat, and other oceanic properties. •\t E.g., The oceanic tunnel and atmospheric bridge from the Southern Ocean (Antarctic Ocean) can af- fect the moisture availability, wind patterns, and climate conditions in the Indian Ocean region •\t Another example of an Oceanic tunnel is the Gulf Stream. It acts as an oceanic tunnel, transporting warm water from the tropics to higher latitudes, affecting the climate and weather patterns in those regions. Conclusion: Cyclones play a crucial role in influencing the monsoon’s onset, with their position and wind circulation around them impacting the transition of the monsoon trough. Climate change introduces new uncertainties, challenging the pre- dictability of the monsoon’s behaviour. However, a late monsoon onset does not necessarily imply a deficit, and In- dia remain watchful and hopeful for the arrival of the mon- soon. Insta Link: Cyclones Mains Links: Q.

Their study provides a window into how processes within and on the surface of Earth operated in the past. Key Findings: •\t The presence of silicic rocks rich in silica indicated explosive sub-marine to sub-aerial volcanic set- tings. Furthermore, the researchers determined that sub-marine turbidity current deposits, com- prising sedimentary rocks, were formed after the volcanic vent drowned. •\t By studying these ancient greenstones, researchers gain insights into various volcanic processes and uncover well-preserved minor sedimentary rocks that formed under sub-marine conditions. Significance: •\t The well-preserved greenstones serve as time cap- sules, providing clues about habitable environ- ments on Earth during its early stages and aiding in the comprehension of the planet’s evolution. •\t It provides evidence for various theories of plate tectonics Various theories of Plate tectonics: Theory Description Key Proponents Continental Drift Suggested that con- tinents were once a supercontinent (Pan- gaea) and have drifted apart over time Alfred Wegener S ea fl o o r Spreading Proposed that new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outward Harry Hess Subduction Theory Described the process of one tectonic plate descending beneath another at subduction zones Charles Darwin, Eduard Suess Plate Tec- tonics Integrated the con- cepts of continen- tal drift and seafloor spreading into a com- prehensive theory Tuzo Wilson, Jason Morgan, Dan McK- enzie www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 12 Key evidence in support of plate tectonics: Evidence Description Fit of Continents The coastlines of continents, such as the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa, fit together like puzzle pieces, indicating their past connection. Fossil Distribu- tion Similar fossils of plants and animals are found on different continents, sug- gesting that they were once joined and have since separated. Rock and Moun- tain Belts Matching rock types, geological forma- tions, and mountain ranges are found across continents that were once part of the same landmass. Palaeomagne- tism The alignment of iron minerals in rocks, recorded by Earth’s magnetic field, shows that the magnetic poles have moved over time and continents have shifted. Mid-Ocean Ridg- es Underwater mountain ranges with a central rift where new crust forms and moves away, supporting the idea of seafloor spreading and the creation of a new oceanic crust. Subduc tion Zones Deep ocean trenches where one tec- tonic plate is forced beneath another, provide evidence of plate convergence and subduction. Earthquake and Volcanic Activity Distribution of earthquakes and volca- noes along plate boundaries, demon- strating the association between plate interactions and geological activity. GENDER SOCIAL NORMS INDEX (GSNI) Context: The UNDP’s Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) 2023 has revealed no improvement in biases against women in a de- cade, with almost 9 out of 10 men and women worldwide still holding such biases. What is the GSNI? • First introduced in the 2019 Human Development Report, GSNI provides an in-depth account of the root causes of gender inequality that hinder prog- ress for women and girls. • It covers 4 key dimensions - political, educational, economic, and physical integrity - to highlight areas where women and girls face systematic disadvantag- es and discrimination. Highlights of the GSNI 2023: ● Half of people worldwide still believe men make better political leaders than women. ● Over 40% believe men make better business execu- tives than women. ● A staggering 25% of people believe it is justified for a man to beat his wife. ● The share of women as heads of state or heads of government has remained around 10% since 1995. ● In the labour market, women occupy less than a third of managerial positions. ● A broken link between women’s progress in educa- tion and economic empowerment. ○ For example, women are more skilled and educated than ever before, yet the average gender income gap remains a staggering 39% in favour of men. Impact of these biases: ● Drive hurdles faced by women manifested in a dis- mantling of women’s rights, and a surge of human rights violations. ● As a result, movements against gender equality are gaining traction in many parts of the world. ● Severe underrepresentation of women in leader- ship. Way ahead: ● Governments have a crucial role in shifting gender social norms. For instance, ○ Parental leave policies have changed per- ceptions around care work responsibilities, and ○ Labour market reforms led to a change in beliefs around the employment of women. ● Directly addressing social norms through education to change people’s views and more representation of women in decision-making and political process- es. ● An important place to start is recognising the eco- nomic value of unpaid care work, as women spend over six times as much time as men on unpaid care work. ● The focus needs to be on expanding human devel- opment through - Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 13 ○ Investment in laws and policy measures that promote women’s equality in political participation. ○ Insurance such as strengthening social pro- tection and care systems. ○ Innovation, for example, combating online hate speech and gender disinformation can help to shift pervasive gender norms to- wards greater acceptance and equality. Conclusion: Gender bias is a pervasive problem worldwide. Therefore, without tackling biased gender social norms, gender equali- ty as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region: ● It is a vast area, encompassing mountain ranges stretching from ○ the Hindu Kush range in northern Afghani- stan to the Arakan range in Myanmar, ○ with the Himalayan range as its spine, and also includes the Tibetan Plateau. ● The region harbours the highest mountain rang- es in the world and contains the largest volume of ice on earth outside of the polar areas and is called “Asia’s water tower”. ● Ice and snow in the HKH are important sources of water for 12 rivers that flow through 16 countries in Asia. ● These rivers provide freshwater and other vital eco- system services to 240 million people in the moun- tains and a further 1.65 billion downstream. ● The region is undergoing “unprecedented and large- ly irreversible” changes triggered by global warm- ing. ICIMOD: ● It is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowl- edge-sharing centre serving the 8 regional member countries (RMCs) of the HKH region - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. ● It was established in 1983 and is headquartered at Lalitpur, which is located in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal. ● ICIMOD promotes and fosters partnerships amongst the RMCs to secure a better future for the people and environment of the HKH region. Findings of the report: ● Many areas around the world have passed “peak water” and communities are dealing with less gla- cier meltwater. ● For the HKH, the peak point has not been reached yet, but it is coming soon. ● As Himalayan glaciers melt due to climate change, water availability in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahma- putra is set to increase (through 2050) in the short term and decrease in the long term (~80% by 2100). ● The Eastern/ lesser Himalayas have fewer glaciers compared to their western counterparts. Hence, riv- ers in the region get less contribution from glaciers and are less likely to be affected overall. ● Climate change is severely affecting biodiversity in HKH. For example, the habitat of Himalayan ibex is likely to reduce by 33 to 64%. Concerns: ● The glaciers act as a savings bank account/ buffer in the hydrological cycle. However, the HKH has seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass. ● There is a chance for more floods and landslides and a loss of savings during the dry years. ● Decreasing snow cover could dry up springs, which is bad for agriculture and will jeopardise the liveli- hoods of 129 million farmers in the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra basins. ● This will make adaptation even harder, as people www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 14 and ecosystems need to adapt not only to decreas- ing snow cover but also to decreasing meltwater. ● Governments have played a limited role in helping mountain communities of the HKH adapt to climate change. Way ahead: ● Generalised reports need to be replaced by specific ones: It would have been great if the report could have told which areas of the Himalayas are expected to be affected and how much. ● Mountain-specific adaptation practices: As adapta- tion in one place might end up being maladaptation in another, the RMCs need to develop/ share a data- base on adaptation practices. Conclusion: As the mountain population and biodiversity of the region (40% of which is under protected areas) are dependent on the cryosphere (the frozen water part of the Earth system), urgent adaptation measures need to be adopted.

(UPSC 2017) MANDYA’S HOYSALA LEGACY Context: The temples in the Mandya district of Karnataka, belonging to the period of the Hoysalas, have failed to grab as much attention as they deserve. The Hoysala Empire: ● It was a Kannadiga power (founder - Sala) that ruled most of what is now Karnataka between the 10th - 14th centuries. ● The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at Belur but was later moved to Halebidu. ● Taking advantage of the warfare between the West- ern Chalukya Empire and Kalachuris of Kalyani, the Hoysalas annexed the fertile areas north of the Ka- veri delta. ● By the 13th century, they governed most of Karna- taka, entire northwestern parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Importance of the Hoysala era: ● It was an important period in the development of South Indian art, architecture, and religion. ● The empire is remembered today primarily for Hoysala architecture - 100 surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka. ● Well-known temples - Chennakeshava Temple in Belur, Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu, Chennake- sava/Keshava Temple in Somanathapura (Mysuru), etc., are known as an amazing display of sculptural exuberance. Architectural features of Hoysala temples: ● Most of the temples follow the ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta pattern - temples with a single, double or three garbhagrihas or sanctum sanctorum. ● There are only two examples of Panchakuta shrines or temples - Keshava temple and the Panchalingesh- wara temple (Mandya). Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 15 Famous temples in Mandya district: Temples Image Description Panchalingeshwara temple Panchakuta shrine, with five sanctums containing five shivalingas. At the doorways are two dwarapalas guarding the sanctum, and the signature of the famous sculptor of the Hoysala pe- riod Mallithamma is clearly visible even today Lakshm inarayana temple Built on a high platform with stellate corners with elephant sculptures that is typical of most Hoysala temples. A fine specimen of Hoysala style known for ornate embel- lishment with sculptures and carvings that is evident both in the temple interiors and the outer walls. Wall panels have remarkable sculptures of Panduranga, Go- vardhanadhari, Dhanavantri, and Dakshinamurthi, etc. Brahmeshwara tem- ple Constructed during the regime of Narasimha I with all the salient features attributable to the Hoysala architecture. S au m y a k esh a v a temple Dated to the 12th century CE and renovated by successive dynasties, it has both Vijayanagar and post-Vijayanagar fea- tures. Reasons why Mandya’s temples are less popular among tourists: ● Proximity to Mysuru, a popular tourist destination, has robbed the sheen off Mandya. ● This is despite the fact that Mandya has 50 State-protected and Centre-protected monuments against 39 in the Mysuru district. Way ahead: ● Installing signboards giving cross-references to important monuments in the district in places where tourist footfalls are high. ● With the popularity of these monuments, efforts to conserve the architectural marvels (most of which are nearly 1000 years old) should grow. Conclusion: Bringing the lesser-known monuments to public light is important not only from a tourism perspective but to showcase a slice of history and heritage. Insta Links: Hoysalas Mains Links: Q.

Vijayanagara Ans: 4 CLIMATE CHANGE AND MOUNTAINS OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE Context: According to a new study, a rise in temperature due to cli- mate change could cause a shift in snowfall to rainfall in mountain regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Findings of the study: ● The mountains across the Northern Hemisphere are likely to see 15% more rain for every 1-degree Cel- sius rise in temperature due to climate change. ● For 2 degrees and 3 degrees rise, the world would see a 30 and 45% increase in rain, respectively. Most vulnerable: ● The Himalayas and the North American Pacific Mountain ranges, including the Cascades, Sierra Ne- vada, and coastal ranges from Canada to Southern California are more threatened than the Rockies or the Alps. ● The Himalayas is one of those hotspot regions where an increased risk (due to changes in atmospheric dy- namics) of rainfall extremes is witnessed. Impact: ● A change in air temperature will shift snowfall in these regions to rainfall and could increase the risk of disasters such as floods, landslides, and soil ero- sion. ● 26% of the global population living in or directly downstream of these mountainous regions is going to be directly affected by this risk. Concerns raised in the Water, Ice, Society, and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HI-WISE) report: ● The ICIMOD report found that the Hindu Kush Hi- malayas have seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass. ● Water availability in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahma- putra is set to increase (through 2050) in the short term and decrease in the long term (~80% by 2100). ● Climate change is severely affecting biodiversity in HKH.

WILL THE INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE SAVE THE MONSOON? Context: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts a nor- mal monsoon despite the possibility of an El Nino event. What is Monsoon and El Nino? •\t Monsoon: A seasonal reversal of wind system that brings heavy rainfall, especially in the Indian sub- continent. The Indian summer monsoon affects a vast region spanning 25 countries and covering a distance of 18,000 kilometres from east to west and 6,000 kilometres from south to north. •\t El Nino: A climate pattern characterized by warm- er-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which can have widespread impacts on weather patterns around the world. Factors that can impact the monsoon rains: Factors Impact on Monsoon El Nino/La Nina El Nino can lead to weaker monsoons, while La Nina can enhance it. Dateline El Nino or a Cen- tral Pacific El Nino It is considered to have a larger neg- ative impact on the monsoon, but an exception was the 2005 El Nino. Atlantic Nino It is the east-west anomaly pattern in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It also in- fluences the monsoon. Indian Ocean Di- pole (IOD) Positive IOD can enhance monsoon, while negative IOD can weaken it. Sea Surface Temperatures Warmer sea surface temperatures can enhance monsoon, while cooler tem- peratures can weaken it. A t mo s p h eri c Pressure Changes in atmospheric pressure pat- terns can affect monsoon circulation and rainfall patterns. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 17 Land-Sea Tem- perature Con- trast Greater contrast between land and sea temperatures can influence monsoon strength and rainfall distribution. Hi ma l a y a n Mountain Range The presence of the Himalayas can in- fluence monsoon winds and rainfall patterns in the Indian subcontinent. Topography The shape and elevation of landforms can impact local wind patterns and rainfall distribution. Tropical Cy- clones The occurrence and track of tropical cy- clones can influence monsoon rainfall, especially in coastal regions. Global Climate Patterns Variations in global climate patterns, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), can affect monsoon dynamics. Local Factors Factors like local vegetation, soil mois- ture, and land use changes can also im- pact monsoon conditions at a regional level. What is the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)? IOD is a climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean charac- terized by the fluctuation of sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure between its eastern and western parts. The IOD is similar in nature to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean but on a smaller scale. How the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) can affect the monsoon: Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) Phase Impact on Mon- soon Example Positive IOD Enhances mon- soon rainfall over the Indian sub- continent In 1997, a positive IOD offset the impact of El Nino, result- ing in above-normal monsoon rainfall. Negative IOD Weakens mon- soon rainfall over the Indian sub- continent In 2019, a negative IOD contributed to deficient monsoon rainfall, particular- ly during the first month of the mon- soon season. Neutral IOD Minimal or neu- tral impact on the monsoon A neutral IOD does not significantly in- fluence the mon- soon and allows oth- er factors to play a more dominant role. The Earth System Science Organisation (ESSO) and the IMD take into account five conditions while making forecasts about the monsoon in April every year. 1) The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient between the North Atlantic and the North Pa- cific (conditions during December of the pre- vious year and January of the present year) 2) SST of the equatorial south Indian Ocean (condi- tions during February and March of the present year) 3) Mean Sea Level pressure in East Asia (conditions during February and March of the present year) 4) The surface air temperature over northwest Eu- rope (conditions during January of the present year) 5) The warm water volume of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (conditions during February and March of the present year) What are the limitations of forecasting El Nino and IOD? •\t For the IOD and Atlantic Nino, forecasting models currently lack the reliability to accurately predict their occurrence and behaviour. As a result, their specific role in influencing monsoon patterns in a particular season remains uncertain. •\t When it comes to forecasting El Nino events, mod- els face challenges in precisely predicting the loca- tion and intensity of warming during the early stag- es.

Context: According to a study, domestic violence will rise as tempera- tures across the Indian subcontinent spike. Findings of the study: ● These findings highlight the vulnerabilities and in- equalities of women experiencing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries in the context of global climate warming. ● High ambient temperature may be associated with the risk of IPV against women. Each 1°C increase in the annual mean temperature is associated with a mean increase in IPV prevalence of 4.49%. ● The prevalence of physical violence was highest (23.0%), followed by emotional and sexual violence. How does global warming increase IPV prevalence? ● Increasing temperature is ○ Squeezing working hours → impacting the income of daily wage earners → Family members spend maximum time within the house → increasing the workload for wom- en. ○ Generating requirements for comfort which low-income groups and economically weak- er sections cannot afford. ○ Directly impacting mental health. ● All of this is contributing to domestic violence. Challenges ahead: The IPV prevalence would increase by 21% by the end of the 21st century under unlimited emissions scenarios. Case of India: ● This comes as India witnessed several heat-related deaths with temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius in certain parts of the country. ● India is likely to experience the highest IPV preva- lence increase (23.5%) in the 2090s, followed by Ne- pal and Pakistan. Way ahead: ● Climate action is an essential component in the on- going fight to eliminate violence against women and girls. ○ For example, under stricter emissions-cut scenarios, the IPV prevalence would only moderately increase. ● The world also needs greater involvement of wom- en in climate action → gender mainstreaming in the policymaking process. ○ UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan (GAP) and the Lima work programme on Gender (LWGP adopted at UNFCCC’s COP 20) are efforts in this direction. Conclusion: Tackling the issue of violence against women and girls is an important step towards achieving the core objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is to leave no one behind.

(UPSC 2021) GS2 THE PRACTICE OF MANUAL SCAVENGING IN INDIA Context: According to the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Em- powerment (MoSJ&E), only 508 districts out of the total 766 in the country have declared themselves manual-scavenging free. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 19 The practice of manual scavenging in India: ● Meaning: Manual scavenging includes the disposal of human excreta manually from dry latrines, and public streets and the maintenance and sweeping of septic tanks, sewers, and gutters. ● Prevalence in India: As many as 58,000 people worked as manual scavengers as of 2018. 941 peo- ple have died since 1993 due to accidents while un- dertaking hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks. ○ The practice, which is considered the worst remaining evidence of untouchability, is most prevalent among people from lower castes/Dalits. Attempts to abolish manual scavenging: Salient features of the Prohibition of Employment as Man- ual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013: • It bans manual scavenging. • It widened the definition of manual scavengers by including it in all forms of manual removal of human excreta. • It lays a key focus on rehabilitating the manual scavengers by organising training programs (at a sti- pend of Rs. 3000) and offering scholarships to their children. • It makes the offence of manual scavenging cogniza- ble and non-bailable. • It makes it obligatory for employers to provide pro- tective tools to the workers. Other efforts: ● The scheme for rehabilitation of manual scaven- gers: Under this, ~58,000 identified sewer workers have been given a one-time cash payout of ₹40,000 each. ● NAMASTE scheme: For 100% mechanisation of sew- er work. The scheme for the rehabilitation of man- ual scavengers has now been merged with the NA- MASTE scheme. Concerns: ● Lack of funding: The Union Budget 2023-24 showed no allocation for the rehabilitation scheme and ₹100 crore allocation for the NAMASTE scheme. ● Less than half of the identified sewer workers are connected to skills training programmes. ● Despite all efforts, manual scavenging is still prac- tised in India. Way ahead: ● All local bodies must identify and profile all septic tank/sewer workers in their respective areas. ● Provide them with occupational training and safety equipment. ● Sign them up for health insurance under the Ayush- man Bharat scheme. Best practice: ● The Bandicoot Robot is the world’s first robotic scavenger, developed as a Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative by the startup Genrobotics. ● Kerala became the first state in the country to use robotic technology (Bandicoot) to clean all its com- missioned manholes. Insta Links: Manual scavenging ROLE OF CITIZENS IN A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY Context: In a representative democracy, the role of citizens is very crit- ical. Representative vs direct democracy: ● In a representative democracy, people vote for rep- resentatives who then vote on policy initiatives. ● In a direct democracy, people vote on policy initia- tives directly. Basic principles of representative democracy: ● Equality of all citizens before the law. ● Free and fair elections. ● Principle of popular sovereignty: majority rule be- ing to carry out the political will of the people. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 20 ● Political liberty: people are free to enjoy fundamen- tal liberties such as freedom of expression, assem- bly, movement, and thought. India’s representative democracy: It is one of the largest and most complex in the world, where elected representa- tives constitute its federal democratic ethos - representing the aspirations of their electorate. Challenges faced by Indian representative democracy: ● Increasing ideological divisions among political par- ties and their supporters. ● The spirit of consensus building is undermined, hampering constructive debates, and resulting in policy paralysis. ● Corruption in governance and personal values erodes individual trust in institutions. ● The role of money power in elections, identity poli- tics, and inequitable opportunities is hindering citi- zens’ right to ethical representation. Reforming representative democracy: ● Increasing people’s participation: by transforming into participatory democracy to foster greater “de- mocratisation” of political life. ○ For example, Gram Sabha [Article 243 (b)]. ● Strengthening federal democracy: Decentralising power and empowering local governments can en- hance accountability and promote citizen participa- tion in matters of national importance. ○ For example, the 73rd and 74th Amend- ments to the Indian Constitution. ● The National Legislators Conference (NLC): ○ It is a pioneering initiative bringing together 4,000 MLAs and MLCs from all political par- ties under one roof. ○ The 3-day boot camp is an opportunity to exchange notes across ideological lines, presenting case studies of best practices and governance. Best practice - Switzerland: ● Direct democracy is one of the special features of the Swiss political system. ● It is underpinned by two instruments: initiatives (to propose constitutional amendments or legislative enactment) and referendums (to express their opin- ion on decisions taken by the Swiss Parliament). Way ahead: ● Explore the possibility of the right to recall ineffi- cient and corrupt politicians. ● Strengthen RTI and protect whistleblowers. ● Leveraging technology to improve governance. With nearly 60% internet penetration in India and 600 million smartphone users, the legislators have an opportunity to reach out to the electorates.

India has had three policies to date. The NEP 2020 proposes vital shifts — from creating a system in which “children not only learn but more importantly learn how to learn” to one in which “pedagogy must evolve to make education more experien- tial, inquiry-driven, flexible” and in which there is “no hard separation between arts and sciences”. National Curricu- lum Framework The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), is a crucial policy document for revising textbooks and classroom pedagogy. Among its key recommen- dations are conducting board exam- inations twice a year, creating a se- mester system for Class 12 students, and providing students with the freedom to pursue a combination of science and humanities, aiming to reduce the rigid boundaries between arts, commerce, and science in class- es 11 and 12 across all school boards. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 21 School Textbooks The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the apex body advising the Centre on school education, has three rounds of revisions in school textbooks. Foreign Universi- ties The UGC is giving the final touches to a regulation that would allow foreign universities to establish campuses in India that have their own admission process, the freedom to determine fee structures and recruit faculty and staff from here and abroad. New Institutions, Enhanced Capac- ity In addition to the new centrally-run educational institutions (including 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 16 IIITs, and 15 AIIMS of which 12 are partially or fully func- tional) set up in the last nine years, there was a significant capacity en- hancement of existing institutions by way of the EWS quota. Female represen- tation The supernumerary seats were in- troduced for women at IITs and NITs in 2018, resulting in a rise in female representation from 9% in 2017 to 20% in 2022 at IITs over five years. According to AISHE data, there has been a reduction in gender disparity in higher education enrolment since 2014. Other significant changes and ini- tiatives in educa- tion The no-detention policy under the Right to Education Act 2009, which guaranteed promotion through Class 1 to 8, was scrapped in 2019. A single agency to conduct all en- trance tests to higher education, the National Testing Agency, was set up in 2017. In a bid to end “inspector raj” and dismantle lobbies, the country’s apex medical education body, the Medical Commission of India, was dissolved in September 2020 and replaced with a new body – National Medical Com- mission. The Higher Education Financing Agency or HEFA was set up in 2017 to leverage funds from the market to finance infrastructure development in educational institutions through long-term loans. Pending Initiatives Autonomy A recent investigation revealed that de- spite the promises of increased autonomy under the IOE scheme, much of it only ex- ists in theory. Vacant Facul- ty and Lead- ership Posi- tions According to parliamentary records, only 1,471 teachers have been hired across all central universities since the start of this recruitment drive, and approximately 6,000 positions (almost 30% of the sanc- tioned posts) remain unfilled.

US-China conflict: ● The 20th edition of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) in Singapore highlighted the deepening ten- sions between the US and China. ● Since its inception in 2002, the SLD has become the premium forum where defence ministers of Asia gather to publicly articulate their positions on re- gional security. USA’s Indo-Pacific strategy: ● Despite the continuing crises in the Middle East and a major war in Europe, Washington has repeatedly reaffirmed that the Indo-Pacific remains the highest priority. ● Removing the Asian fear by explicitly challenging China’s claim to regional hegemony has been at the core of the US Indo-Pacific strategy. USA approach towards China: ● National actions include measures for control of technology exports to China and growing military support for Taiwan. ● The US is mobilising a broad-based coalition to balance China. For example, it has drawn (the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) into the grand regional coalition. ● On the other hand, the US is resuming high-level talks on confidence-building measures to prevent the tensions from escalating. China’s position: ● China is unwilling to accept the US terms of engage- ment and sees USA’s persistent call for high-level di- alogue as a trap. ● China criticises the resurgent “cold war mentality” and demands that “mutual respect should prevail over bullying and hegemony”. Where do Asian countries stand? ● China has been grabbing disputed territories from its neighbours and it is the US that is offering help to defend territorial sovereignty in Asia. ● Many Asian nations have stepped up political and military engagement [Quad, AUKUS, trilateral coor- dination with Seoul and Tokyo, a local quad (Austra- lia, Japan, Philippines)] with the US despite Chinese warnings. ● Yet, there is a reluctance in the region to jeopardise the deep economic relationship with Beijing and a deliberate effort to avoid politically offending Chi- na. India and Japan in USA’s Strategy to Contain China: ● Japan: The US has been encouraging Japan too - ○ Raise its military capabilities, ○ Modernising the military alliance with South Korea, ○ Revitalising military partnership with Manila and ○ Enhancing security cooperation with Indo- nesia. ● India: Building a stronger strategic partnership with India has been a high priority for the Biden admin- istration. ○ The shared interests in stabilising the Asian balance of power are objective realities de- manding a solid India-US defence partner- ship. ○ Currently, both are in talks for a significant elevation of bilateral defence cooperation, including technology transfers and joint de- fence industrial production. Conclusion: ● The USA’s recent approach towards China is seen as an attempt to reverse the dominant perception that China’s domination of Asia is inevitable and Ameri- ca’s retreat is irreversible. ● It is trying to build a ‘New Asia’, where a US-led coa- lition will be the real hegemon.

For example, it has drawn (the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) into the grand regional coalition. Change in USA’s approach: ● However, at the G7 meeting in Hiroshima, the US President appeared to suggest a change of approach by using the word “de-risk” for their economic en- gagement with China instead of the more combative “decouple”. ● The US is also resuming high-level talks on confi- dence-building measures to prevent the tensions from escalating. Why a change in USA’s approach? ● Economic engagement forms a substantial part of the US-China relationship. ● Bilateral trade was almost $700 billion in 2022. The US imports more from China than any other country. ● American companies have long seen China as a top investment destination. China’s suspicion: ● China is unwilling to accept the US terms of engage- ment and sees USA’s persistent call for high-level di- alogue as a trap. ● China criticises the resurgent “cold war mentality” and demands that “mutual respect should prevail over bullying and hegemony”. ● It sees the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) as a mechanism to contain it in the Indo-Pacific. The current state of US-China relations: ● A Cold War-style détente emerged between today’s two superpowers. ● The détente reduced tensions and led to a period of cooperation (between the then superpowers - the US and USSR), even as proxy conflicts played out in their respective spheres of influence.

Conclusion: ● The USA’s recent approach towards China is seen as an attempt to build a ‘New Asia’, where two super- powers (US and China) indirectly accept each other’s spheres of influence. ● India requires a counterbalancing strategy against China that involves cooperating with the US and others with similar interests, while also maintaining strategic autonomy and national interests. Insta Links: USA’s Indo-Pacific Strategy WHO REPORT ON THE ‘HAR GHAR JAL’ PROGRAM Context: The WHO report highlights the significant impact of the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ program on public health and economic savings. The focus of the report is on diarrheal diseases as they contribute significantly to the overall disease burden relat- ed to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) issues. Performance of the Har Ghar Jal program (as per the re- port): Dimensions Observation Impact On Piped Water con- nection Currently, over 12 crore rural house- holds, or 62%, have piped water connections (from about 16% in 2019 when the scheme was launched) No programme has this kind of direct impact on improving the lives of individu- als and families phys- ically, mentally, and financially. Five States includ- ing Gujarat, Telan- gana, Goa, Hary- ana, and Punjab and 3 Union Terri- tories — A& N, Da- man Diu & Dadra Nagar Haveli and Puducherry have reported 100% coverage. Even the laggard states are doing well. Himachal Pradesh (at about 99%), Bihar (at over 96%) Seeing the success, the government has claimed that it will achieve 100% cover- age in all states by 2024 On Health impacts Ensuring safely managed drink- ing water for all could avert near- ly 400,000 deaths caused by diar- rheal diseases and prevent approxi- mately 14 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) related to these diseases. *DALY is a measure that shows the im- pact of a disease or condition on a per- son’s health, com- bining years lost due to premature death and years lived with a disabil- ity. This achievement alone would result in estimated cost sav- ings of up to $101 billion. Every dollar invested in sanitation inter- ventions gives a $4.3 return in the form of reduced healthcare costs On saving time and ef- fort for wom- en In 2018, house- holds spent a stag- gering over 66 mil- lion hours each day collecting water, with the majority occurring in rural areas. Tremendous time and effort have been saved for women and girls through the provision of tap wa- ter. On Safe wa- ter supply In 2018, 36% of In- dia’s total popula- tion, including 44% of the rural popula- tion, lacked access to improved drink- ing-water sources on their premises. Unsafe drinking wa- ter, along with in- adequate sanitation and hygiene, contrib- uted to a number of deaths (esp. among children) and DALYs About the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ programme (also called Nal Se Jal Yojana): About The ‘Har Ghar Jal’ programme aims to provide safe and affordable tap water connections to every rural household in India. Launched 2019 Implementation Under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) (Ministry of Jal Shakti).

Independent India’s agricultural development: ● Food shortage in pre-independent India: Agricul- ture was monsoon-dependent and unfavourable rains and natural calamities resulted in crop failures. ● The planning process in independent India: It iden- tified agriculture as the most prioritised sector and emphasised that ‘everything can wait but agricul- ture’. ● Increase in the food grain production: From mere- ly 51 million tons (Mt) in 1950/51 increased over 6 times to over 314 Mt in 2022. ○ The country became the largest producer of milk, pulses and jute and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, cotton, fruits, and vegetables in the world. Role played by the US in India’s agricultural development: ● The first Agricultural University: ○ The UP Agricultural University (later re- named G.B. Pant University of Agriculture & Technology) was inaugurated in 1960. ○ It is based on the US land-grant model - which integrated teaching, research, and extension. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 26 ○ Thereafter 7 more universities received the US Agency for International Development’s assistance for the training of faculty and the provision of equipment and books. ● The Green Revolution’s seeds: ○ The US aided India’s Green Revolution by supplying seeds with a high output when administered with more inputs (nutrients and water). ○ By 1968, India had transformed from a ship- to-mouth shortage economy to a country that shut down schools and cinema the- atres to store surplus food. ● Recent cooperation: The two countries revived the U.S.-India Agriculture Dialogue as well as the U.S.-India Agricultural Knowledge Initiative (AKI) to share extensive experience in agricultural research, training, and extension. Why does the US help India? ● The Cold War geopolitics and great-power rivalry of those times resulted in competition to extend help to those goods that were viewed as “global public goods”. ○ India’s strategy of “non-alignment” paid off then, just as “multi-alignment” is today. ● Opportunities for U.S. investors in India’s agri-mar- kets: Today, the Indian market can provide significant new investment opportunities in cold chain trans- portation logistics and frozen foods distribution. Cooperation with other countries: ● India and Israel are implementing the “INDO-ISRAEL Agricultural Project Centres of Excellence” and “IN- DO-ISRAEL Villages of Excellence”. ● India and Vietnam agreed to strengthen their spe- cific cooperation to develop a hi-tech agricultural relation in association with environmental protec- tion. ● An India-ASEAN Working Group on Agriculture has been formed, as agriculture is a critical sector for the economy of India as well as the ASEAN Member States. Indian agriculture continues to battle several challenges: Such as increasing productivity against the backdrop of - ● Increasing population, ● Depleting natural resource base, ● Aggravating climate change and ● Reducing farm income. Targets that India has prioritised: ● Doubling farmer’s income, ● Reducing fertiliser use (by 25%) and water use (by 20%), ● Increasing use of renewable energy (50%), ● Reducing GHG emission intensity (45%) and rehabili- tating degraded land of 26 million ha (Mha). Way forward: ● A multi-pronged strategy with integration, diver- sification, intensification, customisation, and farm mechanisation, to realise the full potential of Indian farming. ● Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the National Agricultural Research, Education and Extension System (NAREES) are determined - ○ To harness the advances of S&T ○ To infuse pull and push in agriculture for the all-around welfare of society.

Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 27 Need for inclusive cities: ● India is urbanising rapidly and the country’s urban population is estimated to cross 675 million by 2030. ○ According to the 2011 Census, 1 in 3 PwD in India or roughly 8 million people already live in cities. ● The number of PwD as a share of the population could rise due to disaster and climate risks, demo- graphic changes, and broader definitions of disabili- ty in line with global norms. Solution - Innovative technology and ICT: These are key to ensuring an inclusive urban transformation and essential for improving and increasing the quality of life of all citizens. Importance of assistive technology: ● Manasi Joshi, a para-badminton player, underwent a double leg amputation following a road accident at age 22. ● Availability of assistive technology empowered her by not only helping her overcome obstacles she faced in everyday tasks but also encouraging her to realise her dream of playing professional badminton. Advantages to India: India has a world-class digital governance system and dy- namic tech sectors converging to deliver inclusive prosperity and resilience. Challenges: Innovations that promote inclusivity are often perceived as unprofitable by investors. Steps taken: ● The Smart Solutions Challenge and Inclusive Cities Awards: It was launched in India (2022) by the Na- tional Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and the UN, to enhance the ecosystem for assistive technology and inclusive solutions. ○ It helped in crowd-sourcing tech-based solutions and innovations for addressing city-level accessibility and inclusion chal- lenges. ● Start-up 20 Engagement Group: As part of its G20 Presidency, India has initiated the group to provide a global platform to enable the start-up ecosystem across the member nations. ● G20 Digital Innovation Alliance (G20-DIA): Launched by MeitY to showcase innovative solutions and cre- ate an alliance of players in the innovation ecosys- tem. ● Urban-20 Engagement Group under G20: It seeks to discuss how data and technology can be best utilised for making city management more effective and in- clusive [Theme - ‘Catalysing Digital Urban Futures’]. ● Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation (ALIM- CO): Incorporated in 1972, ALIMCO is a Central Pub- lic Sector unit engaged in the manufacture and sup- ply/distribution of Assistive Devices for PwDs. Way ahead: ● The role of the state becomes critical for promot- ing an ecosystem for transformative technologies, especially where the return on investment may be difficult to measure. ● Behavioural changes, capacity building, invest- ments and policies for accessible infrastructure and inclusive and accessible innovations for creating an inclusive and accessible India. Best practices: ● Smart cities like Bhubaneswar have deployed inno- vative transport and mobility solutions. ● Fifth Sense, IncluMaps, AxcessAble and myUDAAN: These are the assistive technologies supporting in- dependent living for PwD. Conclusion: Accessible India is crucial for the country’s progress towards SDG targets and an equitable urban future as envisioned for the Amrit Kaal - an inclusive, accessible, safe, resilient, and sustainable India@2047.

Background of the US and UNESCO issue: Year Description Reason 1945 The United States initially joined UNESCO in 1945, seeing it as an important platform for promoting international cooperation in education, science, and culture. The U.S. believed in the importance of in- ternational coopera- tion and saw UNESCO as a means to promote its values and interests in these areas. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 28 1984In 1984, under the Rea- gan administration, the U.S. withdrew from the organization. The Reagan adminis- tration believed that UNESCO was not ef- fectively fulfilling its mandate, and was mismanaged and cor- rupt. Its actions were influenced by political biases that favoured the Soviet Union. 2003 The U.S. rejoined UNESCO in 2003 under the George W Bush administration. This decision was driven by a desire to re-engage with multi- lateral institutions and rebuild diplomatic re- lationships. 2011 In 2011, the U.S. and Israel suspended their funding to UNESCO and eventual- ly lost their voting rights. The U.S. and Israel be- lieved that UNESCO’s decision to admit Pal- estine undermined the prospects for Is- raeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and took measures to protest against it. 2017In 2017, under the Trump administration, the U.S. announced its decision to withdraw from UNESCO altogether. The Trump admin- istration perceived UNESCO to have an anti-Israel bias and raised concerns about the effectiveness and value of the organiza- tion’s programs. The administration also expressed concerns about the effective- ness and value of UN- ESCO’s programs. 2023 The US plans to rejoin UNESCO in 2023, reflect- ing a shift in the country’s stance under the Biden administration. The U.S. is concerned about China’s increas- ing influence in UNES- CO, especially in areas related to technology and artificial intelli- gence. By rejoining UNESCO, the Biden administration aims to assert U.S. interests, ensure representa- tion, and shape global standards in these crit- ical fields. Significance of the US rejoining UNESCO: •\t Financial boost: US contributed 22% of the agency’s overall funding before leaving. •\t Global Leadership: The U.S. brings substantial re- sources, expertise, and influence, which can help drive international cooperation and shape global agendas in these areas. •\t Counterbalancing China: The U.S. rejoining UNESCO allows it to counterbalance China’s growing influ- ence within the organization. •\t Multilateral Engagement: This move reinforces the importance of international cooperation and strengthens diplomatic ties with other member states. •\t Preservation of Cultural Heritage: UNESCO plays a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage sites worldwide. •\t Climate Change and Sustainable Development: The U.S.’s re-engagement in these initiatives can en- hance global efforts to mitigate climate change, pro- tect biodiversity, and promote sustainable practices.

About PLI Scheme: In the PLI Scheme, companies receive financial incentives or rewards based on their production and sales. For example, if a company makes more smartphones in India, they can earn a bonus from the government. This encourages companies to increase production, create jobs, and boost the country’s economy. Aspect Details Objective Scale up domestic manufacturing capabil- ity, increase import substitution, and gen- erate employment. Initial Target- ed Industries Mobile and allied Component Manufac- turing, Electrical Component Manufactur- ing, and Medical Devices. Now expanded to Automobile and auto components, Electronics and IT hardware, Telecom, Pharmaceuticals, Solar modules, Metals and mining, Textiles and apparel, White goods, Drones, Advanced chemistry cell batteries, and other sectors as well. Incentives Calculated based on incremental sales. Range from 1% to 20% depending on the industry. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 30 Additional In- centives In some sectors such as advanced chem- istry cell batteries, textile products, and the drone industry, the incentive is based on sales, performance, and local value addition achieved over a period of five years. The success of the PLI Scheme (data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)): Key Highlights of PLI Schemes Details Increase in FDI 76% increase in FDI in the Manufac- turing sector in FY 2021-22 compared to the previous year; Drugs and Phar- maceuticals (+46%), Food Processing Industries (+26%) and Medical Appli- ances (+91%). Value addition 20% value addition achieved in mo- bile manufacturing within a period of 3 years India’s exports basket PLI Schemes have transformed India’s export basket from traditional com- modities to high-value-added prod- ucts. Exports boosted by Rs 2.56 Lakh Crore till FY 2022-23 Investment 733 applications approved to date in 14 sectors with an expected in- vestment of Rs. 3.65 Lakh Crore. Rs. 62,500 Crore investment realized till March 2023, resulting in employment generation of around 3,25,000 Indian farmers and MSMEs in the food processing sector PLI Scheme for Food Processing pos- itively had a positive impact on the income of Indian farmers and MSMEs Import substitu- tion Import substitution of 60% achieved in the Telecom sector, making India self-reliant in Antennae, GPON, and CPE Growth in the drones sector Drones sector turnover has seen 7 times jump due to the PLI Scheme Reduction in im- ports Significant reduction in imports of raw materials in the Pharma sector, transfer of technology in the manu- facturing of Medical Devices Challenges associated with the scheme: Challenges Examples Lack of clarity In the electric auto industry, firms are looking for clarity on the incentives they are supposed to receive. In 2022- 23, incentives could not be disbursed because no auto company presented the required documents. Lack of disburse- ments In 2022-23, the government paid Rs. 2,874 crore to beneficiaries against a claim of Rs. 3,420 crore in various sec- tors. Insufficient in- vestment The low disbursement of incentives suggests that the PLI scheme may not have resulted in the expected level of investment. 6 of the 14 sectors includ- ing textiles, solar PV modules, and ad- vanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries are lagging. Affects competi- tion The state’s decision to select champi- ons and provide fiscal incentives could affect competition in the targeted sec- tors. Documentation issues Without the required documents, in- centives cannot be disbursed to the eli- gible companies. Limited outgo of allocated funds The actual disbursement of funds has been significantly lower than the allo- cated budget for the scheme. Conclusion: Policymakers should not excessively depend on the PLI scheme. It is not a way out of the inadequacies in the man- ufacturing sector. Modern manufacturing depends on com- plex supply chains and giving fiscal incentives to one set of producers may not work. So, the government will have to work on improving the overall industrial environment.

(ILO) ● The practice includes trafficking, sexual exploita- tion, debt bondage, and exploitation in armed con- flicts. ● Child trafficking manifests in the form of domestic labour, forced child labour across industries, and ille- gal activities such as begging, organ trade and com- mercial sex purposes. ● Estimates show that children account for one in ev- ery three detected victims of trafficking worldwide. Prevalence in India: ● According to the NCRB, 8 children were trafficked every day in India in 2021 for labour, begging and sexual exploitation. ● 95% of the reported cases in 2019 were of internal trafficking. ● The sale of children happens across borders too, with key routes being India to Gulf States (for ‘khad- ama’ to work as housemaids) and South East Asian www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 32 countries. Most vulnerable: Minor girls in the age bracket 15-18 years, as they are in greater demand for the sex trade industry and domestic la- bour. Main reasons for child trafficking in India: ● Poverty, hunger, and lack of work. ● This year’s World Day Against Child Labour (June 12) emphasised social injustices (caste and commu- nity-based discrimination and unfair treatment) as the root causes of child labour and trafficking. ● Externalities such as the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflict, and climate change. ● Vulnerable to online sexual predators. ● More than 40% of children trafficked were recruited by a family member or relative. Laws governing anti-trafficking crimes: Laws Salient Provisions/ Issues The Immoral Traffic (Preven- tion) Act 1956 •\t It is targeted at stopping immoral trafficking and sex work. •\t It is criticised for criminalising sex workers without providing suffi- cient legal recourse or scope for rehabilitation, falsely presuming that all trafficking is done for sex work only. The Prohibition of Child Mar- riage Act 2006 •\t It prohibits and penalises the act of child marriage. •\t However, there is a rise in child marriage and sexual abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Child La- bour (Prohibi- tion and Regu- lation) Act 1986 •\t In 2016, an amendment complete- ly banned the employment of chil- dren below 14 years; adolescents aged 14-18 years are not allowed to work in hazardous working con- ditions. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 •\t It prohibits systems of labour where people, including children, work under conditions of servitude to pay off debt, and also provides a framework for rehabilitating re- leased labourers. •\t 22 States and UTs did not report identifying any bonded labour vic- tims or filing a case under the law. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 •\t It governs laws relating to children alleged and found to be in conflict with the law. Protection of Children from Sexual Offenc- es (POCSO) Act 2012 •\t It seeks to prevent commercial sex- ual exploitation of children. The Trafficking in Persons (Pre- vention, Care and Rehabilita- tion) Bill •\t The MWCD published the Draft of the Bill in 2021, detailing measures to prevent, protect and rehabili- tate victims. •\t There are specified penalties for offences divided into “trafficking” and “aggravated trafficking”. It widened the scope of “victims” to include transgender persons. The penalty for trafficking minors: ● For trafficking one minor imprisonment from 10 years to life, along with a fine. ● For trafficking more than one minor, the penalty is life in prison and a fine. Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs): ● India set up AHTUs in 2007, which are tasked with addressing the existing gaps in the law enforcement response, ensuring a victim-centric approach, devel- oping databases on traffickers, etc. ● As of 2022, 768 AHTUs are functional in the coun- try; 20 out of 36 States and UTs have met the target of setting units across all districts. Concerns: ● Gross underestimate of the true extent: Child traf- ficking does not account for missing children - 1 child goes missing every 8 minutes in India. ○ This is mainly due to a lack of awareness about the modalities of trafficking, reluc- tance to seek police help and socio-econom- ic deprivation. ● Low conviction: Less than 10% of the reported cases end up in convictions. ● Lack of coordination among AHTUs and disjointed operations by State and Central Governments. ● Absence of a witness protection framework (the victim is also the witness) and challenges in access- ing compensation. ● The Trafficking in Persons Bill violates the Juvenile Justice Act, as it places the burden of proof on the offender (the child) rather than the prosecuting agency. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 33 ● The 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report: ○ India does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so. ○ India does not have a composite anti-traf- ficking law that addresses prevention, pro- tection, rehabilitation, and compensation of survivors. Way ahead: ● Community-based rehabilitation models allow the greater agency to the individual. ● Revisit existing laws to plug legal holes. ● Cultivate awareness about different trafficking crimes, and form targeted child protection schemes. Conclusion: The antidote to poverty-driven child labour is decent work for adults, so they can support their families and send their children to school, not to work. (ILO Director-General Gilbert F.

The Kakhovka Dam: ● It was built in 1956 (under the Soviet Union) on the Dnipro River in Ukraine (Kherson region) as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. ● The reservoir of the dam supplies water to the Crimean Peninsula (annexed by Russia in 2014) and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant (Europe’s largest and also under Russian control). ● There are different theories behind the collapse of the dam - Ukraine blames Russia/ Russia blames Ukraine/for collapse due to earlier damage. Impact of the collapse: •\t Floods and destruction: The left bank of the Dnipro River remains under Ukrainian control, while the right side is controlled by the Russians. •\t Agriculture and global food security: Often called the “bread basket” of the world, 64% of Ukraine’s wheat is exported to developing countries. The flooding is likely to make arable lands unfit for ag- riculture for years to come due to increased salini- ty in the soil, as well as contamination of irrigation canals. •\t Energy security: Ukraine relies on its four nucle- ar power plants, considered to be a clean energy source, for over half of its energy needs. The dam- age to the hydroelectric dam is also a hit to the re- newable energy resources in Ukraine. •\t Fresh water supplies: For example, water levels in the North Crimea Canal, which brings fresh water from the Dnipro River to the Crimea peninsula, may decrease. Use of water as a weapon of war: ● The use of water as a weapon has a history stretch- ing back to ancient times and it continues today. ● As climate change intensifies water scarcity, the value of water is likely to increase, thus incentivising its further use in conflict. ● Damage to water infrastructure can be an acciden- tal consequence of war or an intentional act. ● Sometimes, weaponising water serves both military and political goals. For example, ○ Israel has restricted water resources to Pal- estinians to displace local populations and undermine Palestinian economic develop- ment. ○ The Syrian regime repeatedly used water shortages against civilians and combatants during the Syrian civil war. ● Upstream states can use water as leverage when ne- gotiating (by threatening to cut or reduce the flow of water) with downstream states about a wide range of issues. For example, ○ Pakistan (downstream) accused India (up- stream) of waging ‘fifth-generation war- fare’ by restricting western rivers (Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum) flow to Pakistan. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 34 ○ India accuses China of controlling the flow of water in the Brahmaputra River by build- ing ‘super’ dams close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Ethical concerns related to the use of water as a weapon of war include: •\t Violation of human rights and denial of access to clean water. •\t Environmental damage and ecological consequences. •\t Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. •\t Breach of international humanitarian law. •\t Long-term consequences and hindrance to post-con- flict recovery. •\t Escalation of conflict and perpetuation of violence. Way ahead: ● The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Pro- tocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its effects. ○ Under the additional protocols, attacks on water infrastructure such as dams can con- stitute a war crime, particularly if they cause significant harm to civilians. ● The international community needs to place greater emphasis on addressing the role of water in conflict. ● However, much depends on how the international community responds and enforces consequences for such violations. Conclusion: The tragic results of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse should bring greater attention to the role that weaponising water is likely to play in the future.

What is the Finance Commission? ● It is a constitutional body constituted every 5 years by the President of India under Article 280 of the Indian Constitution to define the Centre-states fi- nancial relations. ● The First Commission was established in 1951 un- der The Finance Commission (Miscellaneous Provi- sions) Act, 1951. ● Individual commissions operate under the terms of reference (ToR) which are different for every com- mission, and they define the terms of qualification, appointment and disqualification, the term, eligibili- ty, and powers of the Finance Commission. ● As per the constitution, the Commission consists of a chairman and four other members. Each FC is required to make recommendations on: ● Sharing of central taxes with states, ● Distribution of central grants to states, ● Measures to improve the finances of states to sup- plement the resources of panchayats and municipal- ities, and ● Any other matter referred to it. Why is there a need for an FC? ● The Indian federal system allows for the division of power including the taxation powers between the Centre (collects the majority of the tax revenue) and states (responsible for delivering public goods in their areas). ● Sometimes, this (and also due to vast regional dis- parities) leads to states incurring expenditures higher than the revenue generated by them. ● To address these imbalances, the FC recommends the extent of central funds to be shared with states. ● In the pre-reform period, the FC recommendations were not that critical because the Centre had other ways to compensate States (such as plan financing). ● Post-reforms (after 1991), fresh PSU investments have been reduced and the Planning Commission was abolished in 2014 making FC the sole architect/ balancing wheel of India’s fiscal federalism. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 35 Concerns: Issues with the horizontal distribution: ● The ToR of the 15th FC became quite contentious because it referred to the 2011 population figures in determining the expenditure needs of a State. ● This was a departure from the standard practice to use the 1971 population numbers. ● States (particularly the southern States) which had done well in stabilising population growth rates, protested against this change calling it a ‘penalty for good performance’. Issues with the revenue deficit grants that the FC awards to States: ● The rationale of revenue deficit grants is that every State should be able to provide a minimum level of service to its residents. ● Historically, FCs have struggled to determine how much a state’s deficit is due to its fiscal incapacity and how much is due to fiscal irresponsibility. ● They have tried to tweak the distribution formula to support deficit States without penalising responsible States. Areas on which the 16th FC should concentrate: ● Horizontal distribution: ○ The very nature of the horizontal distribu- tion is that richer States compensate poor- er States. ○ The challenge of the government before de- fining the ToR of the 16th FC is to ensure that this happens without further deepening the divide between States (North-South). ● Restraining levying of cesses and surcharges: ○ Raising taxes is the obvious choice for in- creasing revenue, but doing so would re- quire the Centre to provide the States 41 paise (for every Rs raised). ○ On the other hand, it gets to retain every ru- pee if it raises it through a surcharge. ○ The FC should specify conditions under which cesses and surcharges may be im- posed as well as a mechanism for capping the amount that may be raised. ● Restraint on freebies ○ In theory, the restraints imposed by the Fis- cal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act should have acted as a check on such populist spending. ○ Governments have, however, devised inno- vative methods to increase debt without it showing up in the budget books. ○ The FC, in the interest of long-term fiscal sustainability, should lay down guidelines on the spending on freebies.

Status of malnutrition in India: For under 5 years, stunting has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, Wasting has reduced from 21% to 19.3% and Under- weight prevalence has reduced from 35.8% to 32.1% (As per NFHS-5 (2019-21) vs NFHS-4 (2015-16)) About ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services): Description About The ICDS is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It was launched in 1975, to break the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition. Major Objec- tives of ICDS •\t To improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years •\t Promote proper psychological, physical, and social development of the child •\t Reduce mortality, morbidity, malnutrition, and school dropout rates •\t Coordinate policy and imple- mentation among various de- partments for child development •\t Enhance the capability of moth- ers to meet the health and nutri- tional needs of their children. •\t Empower adolescent girls to be- come self-reliant and aware citi- zens Schemes Under ICDS Ang an w a - di Services Scheme Provides services for early childhood care and development, including supple- mentary nutrition, preschool education, health check-ups, and referral services. Pradhan Man- tri Matru Van- dana Yojana Provides cash incentives to pregnant women and lactating mothers during pregnancy and lactation. N a t i o n - al Creche Scheme Offers daycare facilities for children of working women aged 6 months to 6 years, including nutrition, education, and health services. Scheme for Adole sc e n t Girls Empowers out-of-school girls through nutrition, life skills, and education, aiming to improve their social status. Child Protec- tion Scheme Aims to improve the well-being and pro- tection of children in difficult circum- stances, reducing vulnerabilities to abuse and exploitation. POSHAN Abhiyaan Targets the reduction of malnutrition and undernutrition in children, with a focus on adolescent girls, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Services pro- vided under ICDS •\t Supplementary nutrition (SNP). •\t Non-formal preschool education (PSE). •\t Immunisation. •\t Health check-up. •\t Referral services. •\t Nutrition and Health Education (NHE) Significance of ICDS •\t Interventions focusing on nutrition, education, and health during early childhood, such as ICDS, can sig- nificantly improve human capital, particularly in de- veloping countries. •\t The ICDS has a positive impact on cognitive achieve- ments, especially among girls and those from eco- nomically disadvantaged families. •\t Children who were exposed to ICDS during the first three years of life completed more grades of school- ing than those who were not. Challenges with ICDS: •\t Overworked: Anganwadi workers are frequently stretched beyond their limits. •\t Variations: There is a significant variation in the im- plementation of the ICDS and the level of skills of Anganwadi workers •\t Jurisdictions: Anganwadi worker recruitment falls under the jurisdiction of State governments. This sometimes creates coordination issues between the centre and the state. •\t Quality of Services: inadequate infrastructure, lack of trained and motivated personnel, and insufficient availability of essential supplies and equipment. •\t Supplementary Nutrition: There have been instanc- es of “nutrition interruption,” where beneficiaries were not provided with supplementary nutrition for the recommended 300 days a year. •\t Monitoring and Evaluation issues: E.g., inadequate data collection, limited capacity for data analysis, and a lack of timely feedback and corrective mea- sures. •\t Urban-Rural Disparity: ICDS implementation faces specific challenges in urban areas, where popula- tion density, migration, and a lack of adequate in- frastructure pose hurdles in reaching and delivering services to vulnerable populations Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 37 Measures to improve ICDS implementation include: •\t empowering Anganwadi workers by increasing their numbers •\t providing specialized training •\t improving infrastructure and resources •\t strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems •\t promoting community participation and awareness •\t enhancing coordination among departments •\t utilizing technology and innovation for efficient pro- gram management Conclusion: Empowering Anganwadi workers in India strengthens ICDS by improving health and education outcomes for children, reducing malnutrition, enabling easy implementation, creat- ing job opportunities for women, and optimizing resource allocation. It is a crucial step in unlocking the full potential of ICDS. Insta Links: Integrated Child Development Scheme Mains Links: Q.

The person authorised to do so is called a Conciliator. Need to evolve alternative mechanisms: ● To reduce the burden of the Courts. ● To provide speedy access to justice along with the revival and strengthening of traditional systems of dispute resolution. Legal backing to the alternative mechanisms: ● ‘Section 89’ in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, opened the passage of statutory reference to ADR, either by the Courts or the parties themselves. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 40 ● The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: The legislative intent of the Act is to bring domestic as well as international commercial arbitration in con- sonance with - ○ The UNCITRAL Model Rules, ○ The New York Convention and the Geneva Convention. Salient provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: ● It consolidates and amends the law relating to - ○ Domestic arbitration, ○ International commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, and ○ Define the law relating to conciliation. ● The Act provides the procedure to be followed in ar- bitration proceedings, arbitral tribunal, the conduct of the tribunal along with the arbitral awards to be made in a dispute. ● The decision is binding on the parties and given in the form of an arbitral award in an arbitration agree- ment. ● It also prescribes the procedure of appeal to courts in case of discrepancies. The main objective of the Act: ● To make provision for an arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration. ● To minimise the supervisory role of the courts in the arbitral process. ● To permit an arbitral tribunal to use mediation, con- ciliation, or other procedures during the arbitral pro- ceedings in the settlement of the disputes. The main issue faced by the dispute resolution environ- ment in India: ● Increased court intervention in the whole process. ● Thus, arbitration has no longer remained a truly par- ty-driven, cost-effective, and time-bound process. Why is the T K Vishwanathan committee constituted? ● As a continuous endeavour to promote ease of do- ing business, the Department of Legal Affairs is con- sidering the need to further reform the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. ● This will help India become a hub for international arbitration and reduce the burden on courts. The terms of reference for the committee: ● To evaluate and analyse the operation of the pres- ent arbitration ecosystem of the country, including the working of the Arbitration Act. ● To highlight the Arbitration Act’s strengths and weaknesses and challenges vis-a-vis other import- ant foreign jurisdictions. ● To recommend a framework of model arbitration system which is efficient, effective, and economical and caters to the requirements of the users. ● To devise a strategy for developing a competitive environment in the arbitration services market for domestic and international parties.

About Punchhi Commission: •\t The government constituted the Second Commis- sion on Interstate Relations under the chairman- ship of Justice (retired) Madan Mohan Punchhi, for- mer Chief Justice of India along with other eminent persons in 2007. •\t The Commission set up eight task forces to examine the Centre-state relations in depth. Their Fifth Task Force studied criminal justice, national security and Centre-state cooperation. •\t The Commission submitted its report in 2010, but the government could not introduce constitutional changes recommended by the Punchhi Commis- sion. Recommenda- tion Description Feasibility of legislation un- der Article 355 Examined the possibility of enacting supporting legislation under Article 355 to enable the suo motu deployment of Central forces in states when the situa- tion demands. Loc alised Emer g en cy provisions un- der Article 355 Recommended the adoption of “Local- ised Emergency provisions” under Arti- cle 355, allowing the imposition of Cen- tral rule in a limited affected area of a state, such as a municipality or a district, while the rest of the elected state gov- ernment continues undisturbed. The time limit for Central rule under Article 355 Proposed that the Central rule in a lim- ited affected area should not extend be- yond three months. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 41 Amendments to the Commu- nal Violence Bill Suggested amendments to the Commu- nal Violence Bill to include provisions that state consent should not hinder the deployment of Central forces in se- rious communal riots. However, the de- ployment should be limited to one week, with post-facto consent obtained from the state.

(Answer in 250 words) (UPSC 2020) REFORMING WTO Context: The recently concluded G20 working group meeting on trade and investment focused on the important issue of WTO re- form. World Trade Organization (WTO): ● It is a member-driven, consensus-based intergov- ernmental organisation that regulates and facili- tates international trade between nations. ● It is the world’s largest international economic or- ganisation (HQ - Geneva, Switzerland), with 164 member states representing over 98% of global trade and global GDP. ● It officially began operations on January 1, 1995, in accordance with the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement. ● It replaced the 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). What led to the establishment of the WTO? ● The prevailing idea that trade policy is foreign poli- cy because economic interdependence would deter security confrontation. ● The WTO aimed at legalising and policing economic interdependence. Current situation: ● Today’s world is dominated by geoeconomic consid- erations and heightened securitisation of interna- tional economic relations. ● The pursuit of unilateralism in international eco- nomic relations, especially by developed countries like the US. ● Economic policies such as industrial subsidies and local content requirements have made a comeback. ● There is a deliberate effort to weaken trade mul- tilateralism in favour of external plurilateral align- ments keeping the big power confrontation in mind. Challenges: A weak WTO perfectly suits the US as part of its foreign poli- cy aimed at strategic rivalry with China. The role to be played by G20: ● The G20 members are key players in the WTO. ● The push for WTO reforms must come from G20’s “middle powers” such as India, Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa. Critical areas that developing countries should focus on: ● Special and differential treatment (SDT) principles in WTO agreements. ○ SDT provisions give special rights to devel- oping countries and obligate developed countries to treat the former more favour- ably. ○ However, only 21% of the SDT provisions in various WTO agreements oblige developed countries to actually provide differential treatment to developing countries. ○ Therefore, SDT provisions need to be given more teeth and any effort to weaken this treaty-embedded right in the name of WTO reform should be opposed. ● The appellate body - the 2nd tier of the WTO’s two- tiered dispute settlement body - remains paralysed since 2019. ○ This is a US move to dilute the policing part www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 42 of the WTO to pursue trade unilateralism without many checks. ○ The remaining G20 countries need to either persuade the US or resurrect the appellate body without the US. ● Need for a multilateral governance framework for plurilateral agreements. ○ From 2017 onward, there has been a shift away from consensus-based decision-mak- ing principles toward plurilateral discus- sions on issues like investment facilitation. ○ However, forcing plurilateral agreements on non-willing members will accentuate the trust deficit between developed and devel- oping countries. ○ Therefore, a multilateral governance framework should include key principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and in- clusivity in the WTO rulebook. ● Addressing the transparency gap in the WTO. ○ Although WTO member countries are obliged to notify all their laws and regula- tions that affect trade, compliance with this obligation is poor. ○ This increases the cost of trade, especially for developing countries. Conclusion: ● Trade multilateralism might be out of fashion, but remains of vital salience for countries like India. ● Therefore, under its Presidency of the G20, India should work with others to drive the WTO reforms agenda aimed at making trade multilateralism in- clusive.

WTO Ans: 2 THE ISSUE OF CHILD LABOUR IN INDIA Please refer to a previous article on a similar theme: Child trafficking in India Context: According to the ILO, a shocking 10.1 million children in In- dia find themselves engaged in various forms of labour. Child labour: ● A form of modern slavery, child labour includes any work that deprives children of their childhood, po- tential and dignity, and physical or mental develop- ment. (ILO) ● The practice includes trafficking, sexual exploita- tion, debt bondage, and exploitation in armed con- flicts. ● Article 24 of the Indian constitution prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or employed in any hazardous employment. Impact: ● Perpetuates the vicious cycle of poverty (child la- bour → poor education, health → less economic op- portunities → poverty), denying children their fun- damental rights and a better future. ● Child labour exposes children to physical (injuries, health complications and long-term developmental issues) and mental harm (anxiety, emotional trau- ma, and a sense of hopelessness). Prevalence in India: ● According to the latest National Sample Survey data, UP leads with an estimated 2.1 million child labour- ers. ● UP together with Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and MP constitute nearly 55% of the total working children in India. ● Rural-urban distribution: The prevalence of child la- bour in rural areas (14%) is close to three times high- er than in urban areas (5%). ● Gender distribution: Child labour is more prevalent among boys than girls at every age. ● Sectoral distribution: The agriculture sector ac- counts for 70% of child labour (112 million), followed by 20% in services and 10% in industry). ● Their educational status: Nearly 28% of children aged 5-11 years and 35% of children aged 12-14 years involved in child labour are out of school. Case study - The plight of child labourers in India’s Aligarh: ● Aligarh is known for its renowned lock industry. ● Children as small as 12, are employed by the lock manufacturing units for a paltry sum of Rs 120. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 43 Steps taken: Laws Salient Provisions/ Issues The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986 In 2016, an amendment completely banned the employment of children below 14 years; adolescents aged 14-18 years are not allowed to work in hazardous working conditions. The Bonded La- bour System (Abo- lition) Act 1976 It prohibits systems of labour where people, including children, work un- der conditions of servitude to pay off debt, and also provides a framework for rehabilitating released labourers. 22 States and UTs did not report identifying any bonded labour vic- tims or filing a case under the law. The Juvenile Jus- tice (Care and Protection of Chil- dren) Act 2015 It governs laws relating to children alleged and found to be in conflict with the law. Protection of Chil- dren from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012 It seeks to prevent commercial sexu- al exploitation of children. The Trafficking in Persons (Preven- tion, Care and Re- habilitation) Bill The MWCD published the Draft of the Bill in 2021, detailing measures to prevent, protect and rehabilitate victims. There are specified penalties for of- fences divided into “trafficking” and “aggravated trafficking”. It widened the scope of “victims” to include transgender persons. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme: ● The Union Ministry of Labour & Employment has been implementing the scheme for the rehabilita- tion of child labourers through District Project So- cieties under the chairmanship of the District Mag- istrate. ● Under the scheme, the children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres (STCs), where they are provided with - ○ Bridge education, ○ Vocational training, ○ Mid-day meals, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into the formal education system. ● The NCLP scheme has now been subsumed under Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). The role played by the ILO: ● It plays a crucial role in setting international labour standards and advocating for their implementation. ● It facilitates dialogue and cooperation to address labour challenges through its tripartite structure, bringing together representatives of workers, em- ployers, and governments. Way ahead: ● The theme for World Day Against Child Labour 2023 (June 12) is “Social Justice for All. End Child La- bour!” - highlighting the connection between social justice and the issue of child labour. ● Therefore, there is a need to prioritise - ○ Access to quality education empowers them with the knowledge and skills they need to break free from the clutches of la- bour. ○ Enforcement of labour laws and providing social protection. Conclusion: The battle against child labour necessitates a united front - a resolute stance against this grave injustice that brings to- gether governments, non-profits, and individuals from all walks of life.

Major features of the Act: •\t The bill will grant the state government the author- ity to appoint a DGP of its choice. •\t The bill proposes the formation of a seven-member Empanelment Committee by the Punjab govern- ment. •\t The committee will select three senior-most offi- cers from the pool of eligible officers based on their length of service, record, and experience to lead the police force. •\t The provisions of the bill will prevail over any court judgments, orders, or decrees. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 44 Issues with the Bill: As per the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in the former DGP Prakash Singh case (2006) on police reforms, the state government is supposed to send a panel of eligi- ble officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). UPSC then shortlists three officers from the panel and the state government would select an officer of its choice among those three. In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that any rule or law that goes against the guidelines should not be enforced. Therefore, the current bill goes against the Supreme Court’s direction and contradicts it. Punjab Government’s argument for the bill: •\t “Public order” and “Police” fall under the state’s ju- risdiction, as per the seventh schedule of the Con- stitution of India. •\t A proper mechanism for the selection, appoint- ment, and removal of the DGP is necessary, con- sidering the specific challenges faced by Punjab as a border state. Conclusion: Punjab has witnessed recent violent incidents involving Sikh separatists and a deteriorating law and order situa- tion. However, this should not be used as a justification to disregard the Supreme Court’s directive. It is important to strike a balance between the state’s authority in appointing bureaucrats and ensuring adherence to legal and constitu- tional procedures.

(250 Words) SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIA’S JET ENGINE DEAL WITH THE US Context: A mega defence deal for the manufacture of fighter jet en- gines in India is expected to dominate the agenda of the In- dian PM’s ongoing official State Visit to the US. About the deal: ● It will allow American manufacturing company Gen- eral Electric (GE) Aerospace to share critical tech- nology with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). ● This will help in the joint production of GE-F414 jet engines that will power indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas Mk-II. ● According to media reports, the U.S. has agreed to transfer ~80% of the tech value to India, which is unprecedented. Need for the deal: ● India has seen substantial accomplishments in var- ious defence and space programmes and has also designed and built a fighter jet - LCA Tejas. ● However, India has not achieved much success in producing engines to power these aircraft. India’s quest for indigenous aero-engines: ● The quest began in the 1960s with the country’s first indigenous fighter, HF-24 Marut - a supersonic jet, which failed to achieve its potential for want of a suitable engine. ● The Kaveri programme developed an indigenous military gas turbine engine for the ambitious LCA project in 1986. ○ The programme incurred an expenditure of over ₹2,000 crore, however, it failed to meet the necessary technical requirements. ● With Kaveri still a work in progress, India shortlisted American GE-F404 engines for LCA Tejas Mark-1 as an interim measure. ● In 2010, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) selected the more powerful F414 engines to power Tejas Mark-2. The deal did not materialise due to US domestic legislation and regulatory hin- drances. What led to the finalisation of the recent deal? ● With an eye on China, the U.S. recognised India as a major defence partner in 2016, which paved the way for sharing of critical military equipment and technology. ● It sought to put India on par with NATO member countries. ● A new framework to strengthen strategic technol- ogy partnerships put the focus back on the GE-HAL deal at the inaugural meeting of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET). What are the features of the F414 engine? ● It is a fully digital electronic system to control differ- ent aspects of the engine, known as the Full Author- ity Digital Engine Control (FADEC). ● It is added with single-engine safety features cus- tomised to meet the country’s defence require- ments. ● The engines power several advanced, next-gener- ation combat aircraft (Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet and Saab’s JAS 39-Gripen) around the globe. ● India will become the 5th country in the world to Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 45 produce jet engines once the deal is sealed, joining the U.S., Russia, France and the U.K. Significance of the deal for India: ● Challenges faced by India: Dual-threat along its borders and maintaining strategic autonomy in the emerging world order. ○ Therefore, self-reliance and technological transformation in the defence sector is the necessity for India. ● The proposed deal - ○ Will be a significant step for bilateral de- fence and high-tech cooperation amid Chi- na’s growing influence and global techno- logical dominance. ○ Will boost India’s military capabilities at the time of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ○ Will help replace the fleet of ageing Russian fighters with indigenously produced fight- ers. ○ Will save decades of research and develop- ment costs. ○ Overall, it will have a transformative impact on the aerospace and defence manufactur- ing industry. Conclusion: The deal may elevate the U.S. as an alternative to India’s tra- ditional dependence on Russian hardware, particularly amid rising concerns about Russia’s strategic embrace of China.

About the new Bill: ● The Bill is meant to replace the Live-stock Importa- tion Act 1898 and the Live-stock (Amendment) Act 2001. ● It was prepared by the Department of Animal Hus- bandry and Dairying (DAHD), Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying. Salient provisions The Live- stock Impor- tation Act 1898 The Live-Stock Im- portation (Amend- ment) Act 2001 The new Bill It regulates only the im- portation of livestock. It led to the inclu- sion of the import of livestock prod- ucts (meat and meat products). It allows the export of live animals. It also empowered the Centre to reg- ulate, restrict or prohibit the trade of any live-stock product that may be liable to affect human or animal health. It widens the scope of animal import-ex- port (including cats and dogs among ‘live-stock’). It has expanded the definition of livestock to include felines and canines also. It takes away some powers of state gov- ernments to regulate this area. Need for a new law: ● The present law is 125 years old. ● Hence, a need has been felt to align it with the contemporary requirements and prevailing circum- stances related to - ○ Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and ○ Its extant Allocation of Business Rules 1961 Criticism of the draft Bill: ● Animal rights organisations have said that the draft Bill will open a “Pandora’s Box” of cruelties on ani- mals. ● Allowing the live export of animals from India is a free pass for the abuse of millions of animals farmed for food and other uses. Govt’s response: Facing criticism, the Centre has withdrawn the draft Bill. Conclusion: The issue involves sensitivity and emotions with animal welfare and related aspects, and, hence, would need wider consultation. Insta Links: Economics of Animal-Rearing Mains Links: Q.

Ananda Bose holds the State Elec- tion Commission (SEC) accountable for the violence occur- ring during the ongoing panchayat poll process in the state. Recent tussle between West Bengal CM and Governor: •\t The Governor’s recent actions, including returning the joining report of SEC Rajiva Sinha, have trig- gered a constitutional crisis. •\t Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ruled out the pos- sibility of removing the SEC and emphasized the peaceful nature of the elections. •\t Last year, then-governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was ac- cused of delaying bills and interfering in matters of administration by the West Bengal Government. •\t Also, Bengal passed a Bill replacing Governor with CM as state university Chancellor About State Election Commissions (SECs): Description About The SEC is responsible for conducting free, fair, and impartial elections to the local bodies within a state. Appointment of SECs Appointed by the Governor. Powers: Article 243K (1) It vests the superintendence, direc- tion, and control of the preparation of electoral rolls and the conduct of elections to Panchayats (Municipalities under Article 243ZA) in the State Elec- tion Commission, headed by a State Election Commissioner appointed by the Governor. Tenure: Article 243K (2) It states that the tenure and appoint- ment of the State Election Commis- sioner will be directed by the law made by the state legislature. Removal The State Election Commissioner has the status, salary and allowance of a Judge of a High Court and cannot be removed from office except in like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of a High Court. Issues with SECs: Examples Violence during elections E.g., West Bengal Governor blames SEC for violence during recent panchayat polls State govern- ment interfer- ence This is despite the fact that under the constitutional mandate, it is the duty of the State to not interfere with the func- tioning of the State Election Commission Lack of im- partiality and Questionable accountability Often SECs have been found to be hand in glove with the state government. Appointment of serving bu- reaucrats In this regard, SC has observed that This is necessary because giving govern- ment employees the additional charge of State Election Commissioners is a “mockery of the Constitution”. Challenges to independence Tenure and appointment of the State Election Commissioner are directed by the law made by the state legislature. Conflicts with state govern- ment In Maharashtra (2008), then-state elec- tion commissioner Nand Lal was arrest- ed and sent to jail for two days in March 2008 after the Assembly found him guilty of breach of privilege in an alleged conflict over his jurisdiction and powers. Suggestions for Reforms in SECs: Supr e m e Court The Supreme Court in 2021 ruled that serv- ing bureaucrats must not be appointed as election commissioners to ensure that the independence of the office of the elec- tion commissioner is not compromised. 2nd ARC The 2nd ARC suggests that the State Election Commissioner should be appointed by the Governor based on the recommendation of a collegium comprising the Chief Minister, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assem- bly, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly. 2 nd ARC proposes the establishment of an institutional mechanism to facilitate the coordination, sharing of experiences, and resources between the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commissions.

The Global Gender Gap Report: ● It is an annual index first published in 2006 by the WEF to measure gender equality. ● It assesses countries on how well they are dividing their resources and opportunities among their male and female populations, regardless of the overall levels of these resources and opportunities. ● It serves as a catalyst for greater awareness as well as greater exchange between policymakers. Highlights of the 2023 report: ● No country has yet achieved full gender parity. ● For the 14th consecutive year, Iceland (91.2%) takes the top position. It also continues to be the only country to have closed more than 90% of its gender gap. ● Gender parity in Europe (76.3%) surpasses the pari- ty level in North America (75%) this year to rank first of eight geographic regions. ● Sub-Saharan Africa ranks 6th (68.2%), slightly below the global weighted average score (68.3%). ● Southern Asia (63.4%) overtakes the Middle East and North Africa (62.6%) - the region furthest away from parity in 2023. Major challenge: ● The state of gender parity in the labour market re- mains a major challenge. ● Not only has women’s participation in the labour market globally slipped, but other markers of eco- nomic opportunity have been showing substantive disparities between women and men. ● For example, ○ Labour markets of the future: Women re- main significantly underrepresented (29.2%) in the STEM workforce. ○ Skills of the future: Women do not have equal opportunities and access to online learning platforms, given the persistent dig- ital divide. Performance of India: ● The country had improved by 1.4 percentage points and 8 positions since the last edition and had closed 64.3% of the overall gender gap. ● The country had attained parity in enrolment across all levels of education. ● On political empowerment, India has registered 25.3% parity, with women representing 15.1% of parliamentarians - the highest for the country since the inaugural report in 2006. ○ This comes after the WEF recognised the need to enumerate women’s participation in local government bodies in its Gender Gap Report after the Indian government raised the issue. Performance of India’s neighbours: Pakistan at 142, Bangla- desh at 59, China at 107, Nepal at 116, Sri Lanka at 115 and Bhutan at 103. Challenges for India: ● India had reached only 36.7% parity in economic participation and opportunity. ● While there had been an uptick in parity in wages and income, the share of women in senior positions and technical roles had dropped slightly since the last edition. ● The relatively low overall rankings on the Health and Survival sub-index are explained by skewed sex ra- tios at birth. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 48 Way ahead: ● Implementing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programme. ● Increasing women’s economic participation and achieving gender parity in leadership (both busi- ness and government). ● Collective, coordinated, and bold action by private and public sector leaders will be instrumental in ac- celerating progress towards gender parity. Conclusion: The gender parity globally has recovered to pre-Covid levels but the pace of change has stagnated as converging crises slow progress. Insta Links: Women in India Mains Links: Q.

The current regime in India: ● The IT Act 2000 defines an “intermediary” to include any entity between a user and the Internet. ● The IT Rules sub-classify intermediaries into 3 main categories: Social Media Intermediaries (SMIs), Sig- nificant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) and On- line Gaming Intermediaries. ○ SMIs are platforms that facilitate communi- cation and sharing of information between users. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 51 ○ SMIs that have a very large user base (above a specified threshold) are designated as SS- MIs. Issues with the current regime: ● The definition of SMIs is very broad [encompassing a variety of services such as video communications, matrimonial websites, etc]. ● The rules lay down stringent obligations for most intermediaries, such as a 72-hour timeline for re- sponding to law enforcement ‘content take down’ requests. ● Unfortunately, all intermediaries [ISPs, websites, e-commerce platforms, cloud services] are treated similarly, which - ○ Adds to their cost of doing business ○ Exposes them to greater liability without meaningfully reducing risks presented by the Internet. Global regime: ● Only a handful of countries have taken a clear posi- tion on the issue of proportionate regulation of in- termediaries. ● The EU’s Digital Services Act creates 3 tiers of inter- mediaries - hosting services, online platforms, and very large online platforms, with increasing legal ob- ligations. ● Australia has created an 8-fold classification system, with separate industry-drafted codes governing cat- egories such as social media platforms and search engines. Salient provisions of the Digital India Bill: ● Classification of intermediaries: Such as social me- dia platforms, e-commerce platforms, AI platforms, and fact-checking platforms, to prescribe specific rules to different types of intermediaries. ○ It requires intermediaries to undertake risk assessments and uses that information to bucket them into relevant categories. ● New Regulator for the Internet: On the lines of the TRAI or the SEBI. ● Other provisions: ○ The MeitY could classify deliberate misin- formation, identity theft, cyberbullying of children, etc., as offences. ○ Some of the fundamental rules that pres- ently apply to internet platforms, such as safe harbour norms, may also be changed. ○ Penal provisions for violations and user harms related to emerging technolo- gies, including generative AI platforms like ChatGPT. Significance of the Digital India Bill: ● A comprehensive legal framework that will upgrade the current legal regime to tackle emerging chal- lenges (user harm, competition, misinformation) in the digital space. ● It will redefine the contours of how technology is regulated, not just in India but also globally. ● For example, a granular, product-specific classifica- tion could improve accountability and safety online. Way ahead for India: ● As technology evolves, the specific categories may not work in the future. Therefore, an evolving clas- sification framework is the need of the hour. ● Metrics for risk assessment and appropriate thresh- olds would have to be defined and reviewed on a pe- riodic basis in consultation with the industry. ● The goal should also be to minimise obligations on intermediaries and ensure that regulations are pro- portionate to ability and size. ● Setting up in-house grievance appellate mecha- nisms with independent external stakeholders to increase confidence in the grievance process. ● Alternative approaches to curbing virality, such as circuit breakers to slow down content, could also be considered. Conclusion: Deliberation on the Digital India Bill could help create a reg- ulatory environment that helps achieve the government’s policy goal of creating a safer Internet ecosystem, while also allowing businesses to thrive.

DELIMITATION IN ASSAM: CHANGES PRO- POSED AND CONCERNS Context: The Election Commission of India (EC) released a draft delim- itation document for Assam. What is delimitation? • It is the act of redrawing the boundaries of an As- sembly or Lok Sabha seat to reflect changes in pop- ulation over time, based on the most current Census www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 52 data. ● The process may alter the number of seats in a state so that the population of all seats is as uniform as possible across the state. Legal/constitutional provisions: ● Article 82: Following each census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats to the states, as well as the division of each state into territorial constituencies, shall be readjusted by such authority as Parliament may by law determine. ● Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act, 1950: It allows for delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in Arunachal Pradesh, As- sam, Manipur, or Nagaland. ● Article 170 (Composition of the Legislative Assem- blies): Census figures (2001) shall be used for the purpose of readjustment of constituencies in the State. ● Reservation of seats for the SCs/STs will be provided as per Articles 330 (Lok Sabha) and 332 (State As- semblies) of the Constitution. Delimitation Commission: ● Article 82 of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of such a commission through a Par- liamentary act. ● The orders of such a commission (have the force of law and cannot be challenged in court) will take into effect on a date to be determined by India’s Presi- dent Need of delimitation in Assam: ● Assam currently has 14 Lok Sabha, 126 Assembly constituencies. ● The last delimitation of constituencies in Assam was done in 1976 on the basis of the 1971 Census. ○ While the delimitation process was done in the rest of the country in 2008, it was de- ferred in Assam (and some other NE states) citing security concerns of the time. ● In 1971, Assam’s population was 1.46 crore, which increased to 2.66 crore (2001) and to 3.12 crore (2011). Proposals of EC: ● Following a 2020 notification from the Law Ministry, the EC in 2022 announced that it would initiate the exercise on the basis of census figures from 2001. ● While the number of seats is being retained, the EC has proposed not just changes in geographical boundaries, but also an increase in the number of reserved constituencies for STs and SCs. ● Districts with autonomous councils (administered under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution) get more seats. ● Change in nomenclature: Kaliabor Lok Sabha con- stituency now named ‘Kaziranga’ Why have these proposals run into controversy? ● The state’s Bengali-origin Muslim community (of- ten labelled as outsiders and non-indigenous to the state) alleged that the draft is partisan, depriving them politically. ○ Constituencies have been shaped to mix minority areas with majority [Hindu] pop- ulations. ○ Several seats - with a significant Muslim population - have been done away with. ○ For example, as per the draft proposal, con- stituencies of the Barpeta district have now been reduced from 8 to 6 (one of them re- served for SC). ● Constituencies of several sitting legislators and par- liamentarians (across parties) may be impacted by virtue of changes. ○ For example, many Muslim-majority areas from the new Kaziranga constituency have been shifted to neighbouring Nagaon, which will affect the electoral fortunes of sitting MP. Supporters of the proposals: Groups from the Bodo Territorial Council and Karbi Anglong district have hailed the proposal because it secures at least 102 constituencies for the “indigenous” people.

What is Sedition? According to the Section 124A of IPC, Sedition is an act that brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or ex- cites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Govern- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 53 ment established by law in India by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or other- wise. History: •\t Drafted by TB Macaulay and included in the IPC in 1870, Colonial administrators used sedition to lock up people who criticised the British policies. •\t Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhagat Singh, etc., were convicted for their “seditious” speeches, writings and activities under British rule. Views by Supreme Court: •\t In 1962, the Supreme Court decided on the constitu- tionality of Section 124A in Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar. o It upheld the constitutionality of sedition, but limited its application to “acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence”. o It distinguished these from “very strong speech” or the use of “vigorous words” strongly critical of the government. •\t In 1995, the Supreme Court, in Balwant Singh v State of Punjab, held that mere sloganeering which evoked no public response did not amount to sedi- tion. •\t SC (in July 2021): The court ruled that “a statute criminalizing expression based on unconstitution- ally vague definitions of ‘disaffection towards Gov- ernment’ etc. is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) and causes constitutionally impermissible ‘Chilling Effect’ on speech”. •\t In 2022, the SC effectively put on hold the colo- nial-era penal provision and asked the Centre/ states to desist from arresting/prosecuting people under the contentious provision. Sedition law is relevant for India: •\t Threats to the unity and integrity of the nation due to the presence of anti-national elements and divi- sive Forces such as naxals, terrorists and separatists who are receiving support from inside and outside the country. •\t Mere misuse cannot be a ground for repeal, rath- er provisions should be made where such misuse is eliminated. •\t No other law covers sedition: Special laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security Act operate in different fields and do not cover the offence of sedition and therefore, the specific law on sedition is therefore needed. •\t Not really a draconian law: Now after the Supreme Court’s directions, its jurisdiction has been narrowed down. It can be applied only on grounds laid down by the court. •\t Application is a part of reasonable restrictions: It is provided under Article 19 (2). •\t Does not really curb free speech: One can use any kind of strong language in criticism of the govern- ment without inviting sedition. However, such dis- sent should not be turned into some kind of persua- sion to break the country. •\t Jurisdictions like the US, Canada, Australia, UK, etc., have actually merged their sedition law with count- er-terror legislation. Issues with the Sedition Law in India: •\t Against democratic norms: It stifles the democratic and fundamental right (Article 19(1)(a)) of people to criticize the government. It leads to a sort of un- authorised self-censorship, for it produces a chilling effect on free speech. o It suppresses what every citizen ought to do in a democracy — raise questions, debate, disagree and challenge the government’s decisions. o Sedition systematically destroys the soul of Gandhi’s philosophy that is, the right to dis- sent. •\t Inadequate capacity of State Machinery: The police might not have the “requisite” training to under- stand the consequences of imposing such a “strin- gent” provision. •\t Possibility of Misuse: It has been used arbitrarily to curb dissent. In many cases, the main targets have been writers, journalists, activists who question gov- ernment policy and projects, and political dissent- ers. E.g. Vinod Dua v Union of India •\t Low conviction: Charge sheets were filed only in a tiny percentage of cases and not more than a hand- ful ended in convictions upheld by the higher courts. •\t Strong deterrent effect on dissent: The draconi- an nature of this law as the crime is non-bailable, non-cognisable and punishment can extend for life—it has a strong deterrent effect on dissent even if it is not used. •\t Used to gag press: The press should be protected so that it could bare the secrets of the government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in govern- ment. Safeguards recommended by the Law Commission: •\t The preliminary inquiry will be held by a police offi- cer of the rank of inspector or above. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 54 •\t The inquiry will be done within seven days from the occurrence of the incident •\t The preliminary inquiry report will be submitted to the competent government authority for permis- sion for lodging of FIR •\t On the basis of the preliminary report, if the com- petent government authority finds any cogent evi- dence with regard to the commissioning of the of- fence of sedition, it may grant permission to lodge an FIR under Section 124 A of the IPC Recent examples of misuse of Sedition law In February 2021, the Supreme Court protected a political leader and six senior journalists from arrest in sedition cases related to their tweets and sharing unverified news. In June 2021, the court also emphasized the need to define the limits of sedition while protecting two Telugu news channels from coercive action by the Andhra Pradesh gov- ernment. Recently, human rights activists in the northeast have raised concern over the misuse of Sedition law to curb protests in Mizoram. Conclusion The guidelines of the SC must be incorporated in Section 124A as well by amendment to IPC so that any ambiguity must be removed. Only those actions/words that directly re- sult in the use of violence or incitement to violence should be termed seditious. Insta Links: Sedition law Mains Links: Q.

(250 Words) REFORMING MULTILATERAL DEVELOP- MENT BANKS Context: In his address to the US Congress, the Indian PM talked about the relevance of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the need to reform them. The emergence of MDBs: ● At the end of WWII, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods (US) to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and recon- struction. ● This led to the creation of the IMF and World Bank Group (WBG) in 1944. ● The latter was responsible for providing financial as- sistance for the post-war reconstruction and eco- nomic development of the less developed countries. ● While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB, there are ~15-16 prominent MDBs and Regional de- velopment banks (RDBs) today. Relevance of MDBs: ● Credible institutions to support the development of both MICs and LICs amid far-reaching geopolitical changes, economic crises and uncertainties. ● The two traditional goals shared by all multilateral institutions have been the elimination of poverty and fostering of shared prosperity. Challenges faced by MDBs: ● No longer suited in terms of the resources, cultural ethos and methods to address the emerging chal- lenges - global public goods, climate change and pandemics. ● MDBs are in a state of stagnation, trapped in their procedures, approach and methods of work and re- sistant to structural changes. Reforming MDBs: ● In recent years, the restructuring of MDBs (to reflect contemporary realities) has received increasing at- tention. ● The current debate on the reforms of MDBs is a sub- set of the wider debate on the value, content and scope of multilateralism. ○ Multilateralism refers to an alliance of mul- tiple countries pursuing a common goal. ○ It is the most transparent and preferred mode of international cooperation and is based on founding principles such as con- sultation, inclusion and solidarity. Need to reform MDBs: ● To broaden the mandate and vision: To address the challenges of transboundary issues and the oppor- tunities connected with climate change. ● To expand the need for finance and the sources of finance: The WBG estimates that the average annual spending needed to address global challenges of cli- mate change, conflict, and pandemics is $2.4 trillion per year between 2023 and 2030. ● To mobilise private capital: The current system has failed to raise sufficient private finance. ○ On the demand side, there are concerns about moral hazards associated with private capital. ○ On the supply side, private capital is not immune to risks - such as those associated with foreign exchange. ● For India, reforming MDBs would mean advocating the voice of the Global South. Way ahead: Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 55 ● Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs: Under In- dia’s G20 presidency, the Expert Group proposes to submit two reports. ○ The first focuses on issues of vision, finan- cial capacity and modalities of funding the MDBs. ○ The second deals with issues related to har- nessing private capital, risk mitigation, hy- brid innovative financing, etc. ● Enhancing the lending capacities of multilateral in- stitutions by optimising their current balance sheets to attract private capital. ● Creating an incentive structure and bringing chang- es to the current operating model of the MDBs. Conclusion: ● Making MDBs more relevant for addressing 21st-cen- tury challenges would contribute towards enhancing human welfare. ● Deeper integration with multiple stakeholders is crucial. If MDBs do not respond to these new chal- lenges, they will become increasingly irrelevant and be substituted by other forms of cooperation. NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (NRF) Context: The Union Cabinet, chaired by the PM of India, approved the National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill 2023, to give the na- tion’s scientific research a strategic direction. Highlights of the Bill: It will establish NRF and repeal the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) - subsuming it into the NRF. ● SERB is a statutory body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) established in 2009 (by the SERB Act, 2008). ● It was set up for promoting basic research in science and engineering and to provide financial assistance to scientists, academic institutions, R&D laborato- ries, S&T start-ups, etc. National Research Foundation (NRF) About NRF will be established as an apex body at a total estimated cost of ₹50,000 crores from 2023-28 (the government will con- tribute ₹10,000 crores and ~₹36,000 crores are expected to come from the private sec- tor as investments). Recommen- dation National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 Administra- tive depart- ment DST, Ministry of S&T Go v ern ed by A Governing Board: The PM will be the ex-officio President of the Board and the Union Minister of S&T and Union Min- ister of Education will be the ex-officio Vice-Presidents. It will also consist of emi- nent researchers and professionals across disciplines. An Executive Council: Chaired by the Prin- cipal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India. Purpose NRF will seed, grow and promote R&D and foster a culture of research and innovation throughout India’s universities, colleges, research institutions and R&D laboratories. How? By prioritising research funding and ensur- ing that scientific research was conducted and funded equitably with greater partici- pation from the private sector. Currently, the IITs and IISc receive the ma- jority of research funds, whereas State uni- versities receive a very little portion (~10%). By forging collaborations among the in- dustry, academia, and government de- partments and research institutions and creating an interface mechanism for their participation and contribution. By creating a policy framework and put- ting in place regulatory processes that can encourage collaboration and increased spending by the industry on R&D. Signi fi- cance/need of NRF/Bill India barely spends 0.7% of its GDP on R&D, which is extremely low compared to the US (2.83%), China (2.14%), Israel (4.9%), Brazil, Malaysia and Egypt. NRF will promote the democratisation of science funding, finding solutions to the big problems facing Indian society, etc. The Bill was necessary because current laws made it hard for private research or- ganisations to contribute to a funding body such as the NRF.

(UPSC 2014) www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 56 NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL RANKING FRAMEWORK (NIRF) Context: National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) recently re- leased the India Rankings for 2023, evaluating higher edu- cation institutions based on various parameters. What is NIRF Ranking? National Institutional Ranking Framework is a methodology developed by the Ministry of Education (formerly the Minis- try of Human Resource Development) in India to rank high- er education institutions in the country. It was launched in September 2015 and aims to provide a comprehensive as- sessment of institutions based on various parameters. Ranking parameters: 1. Teaching, Learning & Resources (30% weightage) 2. Research and Professional Practice (30%) 3. Graduation Outcomes (20%) 4. Outreach and Inclusivity (10%) 5. Perception (10%) Key highlights of the NIRF 2023: Area of Ranking Major Highlights This year’s ranking has integrated the “Innovation” rank- ing previously executed by the Atal Ranking of Institu- tions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA) into the India Rankings to reduce the burden on institutions of providing similar data to two different agencies Participants Increased participation from 3565 institutes in 2016 to 8686 in 2023 Top Engineering Insti- tutes IIT-Madras (1st), IIT-Delhi (2nd), IIT-Bombay (3rd) Top Management Insti- tutes IIM Ahmedabad (1st), IIM Ban- galore (2nd), IIM Kozhikode (3rd) Top Law Institutes National Law School of India University, Bengaluru (1st), National Law University, Delhi (2nd), NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad (3rd) Top Pharmacy Insti- tutes National Institute of Pharmaceu- tical Education and Research, Hyderabad (1st), Jamia Hamdard (2nd), BITS Pilani (3rd) Top Colleges Delhi University (DU) colleges secured positions in the top 10 colleges in India, with Miranda House (1st) and Hindu College (2nd) leading the rankings Key issues with the NIRF Ranking: Issues Description Me t h o d o l o gy and Indicators Focus on bibliometric measures (e.g., number of citations, publication rather than the quality of papers) sidelining other forms of intellectual contribu- tions. Lack of Compre- hensive Evalua- tion Bibliometric indicators may not fully capture the complexities of scientific performance. Limited Partici- pation Only about 12% of higher educational institutions participated in the ranking process. Urban Bias and Low Progress in Rural Participa- tion Scant presence of colleges from rural areas in the top 100 rankings. The rank- ing is more concentrated at institutes in urban areas. Lack of Trans- parency Institutions and stakeholders should have access to detailed information about the methodology, data sources, weightage assigned to different indica- tors, and the process of data collection and analysis. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 57 Lack of rigorous system An analysis of the data submitted by some private universities under the NIRF provides evidence of data fudging Major challenges pointed out by NIRF ranking for higher education institutes: Incongruence be- tween Quantity and Quality The concentration of high-quality colleges in a few states, highlights the need for a mission to improve quality across the country. Quality Differenc- es between Pri- vate and Govern- ment Institutions Private institutions have lower rank- ings compared to government institu- tions. Correlation be- tween Faculty Strength and Rankings Vast differences in faculty strength between top-ranked and other insti- tutions. Importance of quality educa- tion beyond infrastructure. Scholarly Output and Research In- vestments A small percentage of institutions contribute to a significant portion of scholarly output. Need for increased research investments and funding. Need for Quality Enhancement and Financial Resourc- es Rankings highlight the urgent need for improving quality in the higher ed- ucation system, requiring substantial financial resources. Way forward: To promote comprehensive evaluation of universities in India, it is necessary to move beyond relying solely on bib- liometrics and incorporate a wider range of qualitative and quantitative factors. This will result in a more holistic as- sessment of institutional performance. Additionally, trans- parency in ranking methodologies, the inclusion of diverse factors, and maintaining a balance between quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments are crucial. Conclusion: The rankings underscore the urgent need for quality en- hancement in the higher education system and require sub- stantial financial resources to compete globally.

What is the US-China chips war? The US-China chips war revolves around the rivalry between the two economic powers for dominance in semiconductor technology. The US has implemented restrictions to prevent China from gaining a technological advantage, while also in- vesting in domestic chip manufacturing. China, on the oth- er hand, aims to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors through its “Made in China 2025” plan. The war has dis- rupted global semiconductor supply chains and led to a shift in alliances and trade patterns. In this war, Semiconductors have emerged as the ‘new oil’ Advantages for India in Semiconductor Technology: Advantages Description Strategic Partnership with the US India has positioned itself as a player in the critical semicon- ductor technology field with US’s Micron during the recent PM’s visit. Earlier, in 2022, In- dia- US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) deal was also signed. Government Support and Investment The Indian government has al- located significant funds and resources, amounting to Rs 76,000 crore ($10 billion), to support the development of the semiconductor industry in the country. E.g. through the PLI scheme. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 58 Skilled Workforce India boasts a large pool of skilled professionals in engi- neering and technology. Growing Domestic Market India offers a vast and expanding domestic market for semicon- ductors and related products. Cost Competitiveness India has a competitive advan- tage in terms of cost, offering relatively lower labour and op- erational costs compared to some other countries. Infrastructure Develop- ment The Indian government has been actively working on developing the necessary infrastructure to support semiconductor manu- facturing e.g., the establishment of fabrication plants (fabs) and semiconductor clusters. What are Semiconductors? A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductiv- ity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Semicon- ductors are used to create electronic circuits, such as tran- sistors and diodes, which control the flow of electric current. They are commonly made from materials like silicon or ger- manium and are essential for various applications, including computers, smartphones, Integrated Circuits, defence sys- tems, and AI India’s initiatives: •\t Production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the semiconductor industry •\t Three entities (Vedanta-Foxconn, international consortium ISMC and Singapore-based IGSS Ventures) that had applied to build the chips •\t Semicon India Programme: Launched in 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore, the programme seeks to support the development of the semiconductors and the display manufacturing ecosystem in India. •\t Fiscal support for a design-linked initiative (DLI) scheme to drive global and domestic investment related to design software, IP rights etc. Global Initiatives for Semiconductors: •\t Semiconductor friend-shoring among the Quad members by USA, to building “resilient, diverse and secure supply chains of critical and emerging tech- nologies”. •\t US-led “Chip 4 Alliance” with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to restrict Chinese access to chip tech. •\t Taiwan produces over 60% of the world’s semicon- ductors and over 90% of the most advanced ones. •\t “Made in China 2025” plan: to get self-sufficiency in semiconductor Challenges for India: •\t India is currently at least two decades behind in chip manufacturing •\t It lacks the necessary infrastructure, uninterrupted power and water supply, and a skilled workforce. •\t There is a need for the development of a compre- hensive chip ecosystem and ancillary industries in India. Conclusion: Despite these challenges, India’s partnership with the US positions it in the global chip war and has the potential to elevate bilateral ties to the next level.

GS3 PREVENTING THE TRAGEDIES ON TRACKS Context: The tragic Odisha train accident that resulted in the death of over 288 passengers has brought into sharp focus the safety mechanisms for its prevention. Causes of train accidents in India? Findings of The Performance Audit on Derailment in Indian Railways - a CAG (2022) report: ● The main reason behind train accidents in India is derailments. ○ For example, out of 217 “consequential train accidents” – that have serious repercussions in terms of either loss of human life/injury or loss of Railway property, 75% were due to derailments during 2017-18 to 2020-21. ● Factors responsible for derailments are mainte- nance of tracks, deviation of track parameters be- yond permissible limits, bad driving and over-speed- ing, and faulty signalling system (suspected cause of the Odisha train accident). Some initiatives of the Indian govt. to prevent train acci- dents: The KAVACH: ● It is an indigenously developed Automatic Train Pro- tection (ATP) system by the Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in collaboration with the Indian industry. ● It provides protection by preventing trains from passing the signal at Red and activates the train’s braking system automatically (if the driver jumps the red signal) and avoids collision. ● The Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) helps in two-way communication between the station master and loco-pilot to convey any emergency message. ● Both the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express and the Yeshwanthpur-Howrah Express were not fitted with KAVACH-TCAS. The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK): ● It was created in 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore over a period of five years with an annual out- lay of Rs 20,000 crore. ● The safety fund will be used for improved inspec- tion and safety work at level crossing, track repair, bridge restoration, rolling stock replacement, hu- man resource development, etc. ● The number of funds allocated for track renewal projects decreased from Rs 9,607.65 crore (2018-19) to Rs 7,417 crore (2019-20), and even this amount was not “fully utilised”.

The country’s existing strategic oil storage facilities are made www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 60 up of excavated rock caverns. About Strategic Oil Reserves: • A strategic oil reserve refers to a stockpile of crude oil or petroleum products that a country maintains as a strategic measure to ensure energy security and stability in times of emergencies or disruptions in oil supply. • The International Energy Agency (IEA) recommends that all countries maintain emergency oil stockpiles equivalent to 90 days of import protection. Statistics about Oil Reserves in India: • India, the world’s third-largest consumer of crude, depends on imports for more than 85% of its re- quirement. • India currently has an SPR capacity of 5.33 million tonnes or around 39 million barrels of crude. India’s strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) currently provide around 9.5 days of oil requirement coverage. • Additionally, oil marketing companies in India have their storage facilities, providing an additional 64.5 days of storage, totalling approximately 74 days of petroleum demand coverage. • India’s strategic crude oil storages are currently lo- cated at Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Manga- luru (Karnataka), Padur (Karnataka) and Chandikhol in Odisha. • The construction of the Strategic Crude Oil Storage facilities in India is being managed by Indian Stra- tegic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL) (a whol- ly owned subsidiary of Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas). Underground storage It is, by far the most economical method of storing petro- leum products because the underground facility rules out the requirement of large swathes of land, ensures less evaporation and, since the caverns are built much below the sea level, it is easy to discharge crude into them from ships. Two types of underground reserves: Salt Cavern-Based Re- serves Rock Cav- ern-Based Re- serves Development Process Developed through solution mining, in- volving the dissolution of salt deposits De v e lope d through excava- tion Cost and Time Simpler, faster, and less cost-intensive More complex, time-consuming, and expensive Sealing and Accessibility Naturally well-sealed and engineered for rapid injection and ex- traction May require ad- ditional sealing measures and ac- cess points Oil Absorben- cy Extremely low oil ab- sorbency, creating a natural impermeable barrier Absorbency var- ies depending on the rock type Operation Can be created and operated almost en- tirely from the surface Requires excava- tion and under- ground opera- tions Examples US Strategic Petro- leum Reserve (SPR) consists of salt cav- ern-based storage fa- cilities Mangaluru and Padur in Kar- nataka, and Vi- sakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh Usage Primarily used for oil storage, but also suit- able for liquid fuels, natural gas, com- pressed air, and hy- drogen Primarily used for oil storage Insta Links: Strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) programme IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY Context: Despite the importance of biodiversity that ultimately sus- tains all human endeavours, not enough has been done for caring and nurturing life on earth. Biodiversity/Biological diversity: ● Meaning: The rich variety of life forms and their interconnections with each other and the environ- ment is termed Biodiversity. ● Types: Genetic diversity (variety of genes within a species), species diversity (variety of species within a habitat or a region) and ecosystem diversity (vari- ety of species within a habitat or a region). ● Importance of Biodiversity: ○ Ecosystem services: Species perform some or the other functions (soil formation, re- ducing pollution) in an ecosystem. ○ Provisioning services: Food, fibre, fuel- wood, etc. It is biodiversity that will form the basis of a new sustainable green economy. ○ Regulating services: It is biodiversity that will restore degraded lands and polluted riv- ers and oceans and sustain agriculture in the face of climate change. ○ Supporting services: Biodiversity helps in Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 61 pollination, nutrient cycling as well as recy- cling, GHGs reduction by sequestration. ○ Social and cultural services: Biodiversity provides aesthetic, and recreational plea- sure. ○ Food web maintenance: Higher the diversi- ty of an ecosystem, more complex is going to be the food webs. ○ Scientific role: Biodiversity help in scientific research, education and monitoring. ● Threats: ● Impact of loss of Biodiversity: Damaged ecosystems exacerbate climate change, undermine food securi- ty, and put people and communities at risk. Efforts to reverse Biodiversity loss: Global Indian Convention on Biodi- versity (CBD) Biological Diversity Act, 2002, National Biodiversity Policy, National Biodiversity Action Plan The observance of In- ternational Biodiversi- ty Day (May 22) to in- crease understanding and awareness of bio- diversity issues.

Designation Biodiver- sity hotspots (by CI), Biosphere reserves (by UNESCO) The Kunming-Montre- al Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Way ahead: ● Civil society must play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity. ● A paradigm shift in the care of biodiversity. ○ For example, the main custodian of the nat- ural world in India is the Indian Forest Ser- vice. ○ Therefore, a multifunctional landscapes approach, with the direct participation of local communities is the need of the hour. Some best practices from India: ● The Forest Rights Act 2006: It calls for an increase in the stake of indigenous groups in ownership as well as management of biodiversity. However, the Act largely remains on paper. ● National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well- being: It is a proposed mission (India’s Biodiversity Collaborative based in Bengaluru, conceptualised the idea) to have all citizens engaged in the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Conclusion: It is time to decentralise the management of biodiversity by bringing together multiple stakeholders, especially local communities, through gram sabhas and biodiversity man- agement committees.

What is Solar E-Waste? Solar e-waste refers to the electronic waste generated by dis- carded solar panels. As solar panels have a limited lifespan of 20-25 years, their disposal raises concerns about manag- ing the waste they create. What does Solar Panel consist of? A PV module is essentially made up of glass, metal, silicon and polymer fractions. Glass and aluminium, together con- stituting around 80% of total weight, are non-hazardous.

Issues with Solar E-Waste Management: Issue Example Lack of compre- hensive policy Many countries lack comprehensive policies and regulations specifically addressing the management of solar e-waste. Increasing vol- ume of solar waste India could generate over 34,600 tonnes of solar waste by 2030 Limited recycling infrastructure Insufficient recycling plants and infra- structure High cost of recy- cling Recycling a solar panel cost between $20 and $30, while landfill disposal costs $1-2 Toxic materials in the solar waste Solar panels contain toxic metals and minerals that can harm the environ- ment when not properly managed Limited aware- ness and enforce- ment Lack of awareness among stakehold- ers and inadequate enforcement of recycling regulations Landfill disposal Improper disposal of solar waste in landfills, posing environmental risks Resource wast- age Discarded solar panels contain valu- able materials like silver, copper, and semiconductor-grade quartz. Various technologies available to extract valuable materials from solar e-waste include: •\t Mechanical Shredding: Solar panels can be shred- ded into small pieces and subsequent separation techniques to recover metals like aluminium and copper. •\t Thermal Treatment: such as pyrolysis and gasifica- tion, can be employed to break down solar panels at high temperatures, recovering valuable materials and generating energy-rich gases or liquids. •\t Chemical Leaching: Chemical solvents or acids can be used to dissolve and separate valuable metals, such as silver and copper, from the solar panel com- ponents. •\t Electrochemical Processes: can be utilized to selec- tively extract metals from solar panel components by applying electrical currents or potential differenc- es. •\t Automated Robotic Systems: equipped with sen- sors and artificial intelligence can be used to identi- fy and separate different components of solar pan- els for efficient material recovery.

Groundwater: ● Groundwater is the water that seeps through rocks and soil and is stored beneath the ground. Aquifers are the rocks in which groundwater is stored. ● Groundwater management is imperative to meet the UN-mandated SDG 6 of providing clean water and sanitation for all. Groundwater situation in India: ● Groundwater is India’s most used water resource, accounting for a quarter of total global groundwater extraction. ● According to the 2021 CAG report, groundwater ex- traction in India has exceeded the recharge rate, threatening 80% of potable water over the next two decades. ● About 95% of India’s groundwater was depleted between 2002 and 2022, mostly in north India due to increased groundwater pumping to meet crop ir- rigation needs. Legal/constitutional/policy framework in India: ● The Indian Easement Act, 1882 fails to establish groundwater ownership and rights clearly. ● Article 21: The fundamental right to clean water is recognised under the right to life. ● Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA): It is es- tablished by the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to frame groundwater policies and programs. ● Supreme Court: ‘Public trust doctrine’ - Making www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 64 groundwater a matter of private ownership would be unfair. ● Govt schemes: Atal Bhujal Yojana, Jal Shakti Abhi- yan, Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme, etc., are some of the initiatives for groundwater management. Challenges: ● Climate change (global warming will increase the frequency of hydroclimate extremes - floods and droughts) and unsustainable groundwater ex- traction. ○ The amount of rain (during the summer monsoon) will rise as the climate warms. ○ However, groundwater recovery may not be possible due to the expected rise in ground- water extraction for irrigation. ● A warming climate will increase evapotranspiration - the process by which water moves from the land surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and tran- spiration. Way ahead: ● Restrict unsustainable groundwater use for irriga- tion, cracking down on illegal borewells. ● Make irrigation more efficient to promote ground- water conservation. ● Groundwater storage variations can be understood by satellite data [say, from NASA’s GRACE satellites] that help conservation efforts be planned appropri- ately.

About Higgs Boson: •\t The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that gives other particles mass. The strength of a particle’s in- teraction with the Higgs boson determines its mass. •\t For Example, Electrons have a certain mass, protons have more, and neutrons have slightly more than protons because of their interactions with the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson can also interact with other Higgs bosons, indicating its greater mass. Need for understanding Higgs Boson: •\t The properties of the Higgs boson and how particles interact with it can provide insights into the uni- verse. Z boson and a photon: •\t Virtual particles are particles that briefly exist and cannot be directly detected but have lingering ef- fects according to quantum field theory. •\t The creation of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves interactions with virtual par- ticles, resulting in the production of a Z boson and a photon. Photons, which are particles of light, have no mass because they do not interact with the Higgs boson. About the Standard Model of Particle Physics: •\t The Standard Model is a theory in physics that de- scribes how the smallest particles in the universe behave and interact with each other. •\t According to the Standard Model, there are several types of particles. There are particles called quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neu- trons, and there are particles called leptons, which include electrons. These particles have different properties like mass and electric charge. •\t The theory explains how these particles interact with each other through different forces. •\t The Standard Model predicts the probabilities of different decay paths. The recent measurement confirms the decay of a Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon, which was previously observed but now with increased statistical precision.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): ● It is an intergovernmental organization (an official UN observer, founded in 2009, HQ - Masdar City, Abu Dhabi) mandated to facilitate cooperation, ad- vance knowledge, and promote the adoption and sustainable use of renewable energy. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 65 ● It is the first international organization to focus ex- clusively on renewable energy, addressing needs in both industrialized and developing countries. Need for low-cost finance for the energy transition: ● The energy transition is essential to achieve the 1.5°C climate target under the Paris Agreement. ● Hence, for a sustained energy transition, it is es- sential to ensure that low-cost finance is available to both emerging markets and advanced economies. Highlights of the report: ● Success story: Renewable power generation tech- nologies, notably solar photovoltaic and onshore wind power, have become mature and competitive. ● Other technologies: Such as offshore wind, hydro- gen electrolysers, energy storage and heat pumps, need to be deployed at faster speeds, and greater scales. Recommendations: ● Govt. policies to support industry innovation: Par- ticularly during the early R&D to foster commercially mature solutions with reduced costs. ● Green hydrogen: To enable end-use technologies utilising hydrogen, as well as the expansion of infra- structure to harness this potential. ● Investment in energy transition technologies: With a focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, electrification and enabling infrastructure - end-use electrification - to fully capture the benefit of re- newable power. Case of India: ● The renewable energy sector: ○ It has seen unprecedented growth driven by national targets of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. ○ India ranked third on the Renewable Ener- gy Attractive Index in 2021, and its solar and wind power base is the fourth largest in the world. ● IREDA’s role in India’s Energy Transition: The Indi- an Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) was established by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy as a renewable-energy-focussed non-bank finance corporation in 1987. ● India Sovereign Green Bond Issuance: To mobilize private sector capital for sustainable development and lower the cost of capital for green projects by tapping into new investors. Way ahead to ensure low-cost finance for the energy tran- sition: ● Blended capital needs to be urgently mobilised: From the domestic and international capital resourc- es of the private and public sectors. ● Domestic financial markets are critical: Since they provide diversified funding sources (corporate bond markets) to avoid currency risk and help mitigate macroeconomic shocks. ● G20 members have a wealth of experience: In facili- tating access to low-cost finance and can share valu- able knowledge on innovative financing solutions to reduce the cost of capital. Conclusion: Low-cost capital for financing energy transition projects could be possible through a deeper public-private collabora- tion on the journey to a net-zero future.

The cybersecurity landscape in India: ● Cybersecurity refers to every aspect of protecting an organisation and its employees and assets against www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 66 cyber threats. ● India, as a nation undergoing rapid digitisation across various sectors, is prone to increasing num- ber and severity of cyber threats. ● To address these challenges, stakeholders in the ecosystem have implemented several initiatives to promote Cybersecurity in the country. ● These include - ○ The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), set up to provide guidance and support in the event of cyber incidents; ○ Programs like Cyber Shikshaa, implement- ed by Microsoft and DSCI, to skilled profes- sionals in the Cybersecurity domain and to generate awareness among people. ● Though the cybersecurity industry has gained signif- icant importance and is expected to grow rapidly in India, there is still a deficit of skilled workforce to cater to the demands of the sector. About the study: It aims to ● Analyse the demand and supply of skilled cyberse- curity professionals in India, ● Identify technical and social factors contributing to the shortage of skilled professionals, and ● Explore solutions to address these gaps through CSR and a multi-stakeholder approach. Findings of the study: The top three attacks: ● Phishing, smishing, and vishing attacks expected to see substantial rise in near future. ● Phishing scams trick users into divulging sensitive data, downloading malware, and exposing them- selves or their organisations to cybercrime. ● Smishing often involves sending bogus text messag- es - have a sense of urgency and request the recipi- ent click on a link or reply with personal information. ● Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing) uses voice and tele- phony technologies to trick targeted individuals into revealing sensitive data to unauthorised entities. ● Zero-day attacks take place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it. Three major trends: That will catalyse the demand for Cy- bersecurity are - ● Use of AI, ML and IoT by hackers resulting in increas- ing Cybersecurity attacks, ● Growing regulatory liabilities and ● Excessive usage of digital platforms resulting in ex- change of large amounts of data. Cybersecurity professionals: ● Cybersecurity Risk Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Penetration Tester are the most prevalent job roles at present. ● They constitute less than 5% of their company’s overall workforce. ● 43% of corporations have women participation be- tween 21%-40% of the overall Cybersecurity work- force. Recommendations: ● Need for organisations to perform risk assessments at regular intervals and have robust security mea- sures. ● There is a need for - ○ Multi-stakeholder collaboration to map in- dustry-relevant skills, and design and deliver skilling programs as per industry standards. ○ Training providers/NGOs to promote the inclusion of diverse groups and formulate strong inclusive programs that can specifi- cally cater for the needs of PwDs. ● Corporates can play a pivotal role through their Cor- porate Social Responsibility (CSR) Insta Links: Cybersecurity in India Mains Links: Q.

(UPSC 2021) PULSES AND EDIBLE OIL PRODUCTION IN INDIA Context: As compared to edible oil, India has relatively achieved self-reliance in pulses. Edible oil production in India: Import of edible oil by India: The quantum of imports has surged from ~8 mt to 16 mt between 2013-14 and 2022-23 (from ~$7 to 21 billion in value terms). Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 67 Govt efforts to increase edible oil production: ● National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NFSM-OS and OP): The government has been implementing this Centrally-sponsored scheme from 2018-19 to increase the production and productivity of oilseeds in the country. ● National Mission on Edible Oils (Oil Palm) [NMEO (OP)] Concerns: The productivity (yield) gap between improved technology and farmers’ practices ranged from 21% in sesa- me to 149% in sunflower. Case of pulses: ● India is the largest producer (25% of global produc- tion), consumer (27% of world consumption) and importer (14%) of pulses in the world. ● Though pulses are grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, Rabi pulses contribute more than 60% of the total production. Import data: In quantity terms, India’s imports of pulses came down from 6.61 mt in 2016-17 to 2.52 mt in 2022-23. Reasons behind the reduction in pulses imports: ● Higher domestic production: India’s pulses output has increased from ~19 mt in 2013-14 to 28 mt in 2022-23, which translates into a self-sufficiency ra- tio of over 90% in pulses (40% for edible oils). ● Imports of chickpea (chana) have recorded dramat- ic drops: The boost to chana production came from two key government measures, ○ The levy of a 60% import duty on chana since March 2018. ○ Government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP). ○ These incentivised Indian farmers to ex- pand the area under the pulses crop grown during the rabi (winter-spring) season. Concerns: ● Arhar/Tur/pigeon pea is the problem: Arhar im- ports from Mozambique, Myanmar, Tanzania, Mala- wi, and Sudan hit a record 0.9 mt in 2022-23. ● Implications of imports: The overall import figures have not significantly reduced as a result of the er- ratic production of most non-chana pulses. This may result in inflation amid worries about El Nino. Way ahead: ● The government must address micro-irrigation, quality seeds, marketing infrastructure and gov- ernment policy issues to decrease dependency on imports. ● Technology and market support to farmers are the key to increasing oilseed production.

(UPSC 2018) TRACKING SDG7: THE ENERGY PROGRESS REPORT 2023 Context: The world is facing challenges in achieving Sustainable De- velopment Goal 7 (SDG 7) by 2030. The report has been released by a collaborative effort of the International Energy Agency (IEA), International Re- newable Energy Agency, United Nations Statistics Division, World Bank and the WHO What is SDG 7? SDG 7 refers to Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims at reaching universal access to electricity and clean cook- ing, doubling historic levels of efficiency improvements, and substantially increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix. Factors limiting the world in achieving SDG 7 are: Factors Examples High inflation Rapidly increasing energy costs affecting affordability Uncertain macroeco- nomic outlook Fluctuating economic conditions impacting energy investments Debt distress Countries struggling with unsus- tainable debt burdens Lack of financing Insufficient funds for energy proj- ects and infrastructure Supply chain bottle- necks Delays in procuring and delivering energy equipment and materials Tighter fiscal circum- stances Government budget constraints limiting energy-related initiatives Soaring prices for ma- terials Increased costs of solar panels, batteries, and other components Currency fluctuations Exchange rate instability impact- ing energy investments The concentration of financial flows Limited distribution of interna- tional public financial resources The decreasing trend in international public financial flows Reduction in funds supporting clean energy in developing coun- tries The report provides the following recommendations: •\t Scale up efforts to promote renewable energy and www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 68 energy efficiency to meet the targets of SDG 7. •\t Enhance financial flows and investment in clean en- ergy technologies, especially in developing countries (to the tune of USD 1.4-1.7 trillion through 2030). •\t Address the challenges of high inflation, uncertain macroeconomic outlook, and debt distress •\t Accelerate progress in energy intensity improve- ment to exceed the targeted rate and ensure sus- tainable energy consumption patterns. •\t Strengthen international cooperation and support for countries facing energy challenges, especially the least-developed countries and small island de- veloping states. •\t Monitor and track progress regularly to identify gaps and take necessary corrective measures. India’s status: •\t India is ‘On-Target’ to meeting universal access to electricity o In April 2018 India achieved its goal, ahead of schedule, of providing electricity to every village in India. •\t Despite a national policy push for clean fuel for cooking, more than two-thirds (479) of districts re- main ‘Off-Target’.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 Ans: B A JUST ENERGY TRANSITION FOR A LOW-CARBON FUTURE Context: Given the significant impact that cities have on the environ- ment, low-carbon cities are crucial to mitigate the effects of climate change. How are cities impacting climate? ● In 2020, cities across the world dumped 29 trillion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. ● This CO2 along with other GHGs poses a serious health hazard and also manifests as extreme weath- er events, leading to the loss of lives and livelihoods. Challenges ahead: By 2050, 7 billion people will be living in cities. Need of the hour - A just energy-system transition: ● This could reduce urban CO2 emissions by around 74%. ● The transition must be implemented both on the demand and the supply sides. Mitigation options on the supply side: Include phasing out fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewables in the en- ergy mix, and using carbon capture and storage (CCS) tech- nologies. On the demand side: ● Using the Avoid, Shift, Improve, framework - reduc- ing and substituting the demand for fossil fuels with renewables. ● Addressing residual emissions in the energy sector by implementing CO2 removal (CDR) technologies. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 69 Why is a just energy transition needed? ● A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to ensure a socially and environmentally just transition. ○ For example, transitioning to renewable en- ergy sources could disproportionately affect communities and fossil fuels-dependent sectors in developing economies. ● Other concerns include land dispossession related to large-scale renewable energy projects, spatial concentration of poverty, gendered impacts, etc. Significance of Indian states to achieve energy transition goals: ● States as spheres of implementation: The realisa- tion of national goals often depends on how they are aligned with State priorities and capabilities. ● States as laboratories of policy innovations: For ex- ample, PM KUSUM is a national adoption of success- ful State efforts on solarizing agriculture. ● The legacy issues must be addressed at the State level: Such as high losses, unreliable supply, and ser- vice quality in the electricity sector. Good news: With rapid advancements in clean energy and related tech- nologies and reduced cost, the economic and technological barriers to implementing low-carbon solutions have been crossed. Way ahead: ● Transitioning to low-carbon/net-zero cities: It is necessary to decarbonise urban systems. ● Sector-coupling approach: Integrate mitigation and adaptation options in multiple sectors, including en- ergy, buildings, transportation, industry, and urban land use. ● A State-level framework: To understand plans, ac- tions, and governance processes and to broaden the transition discourse. ● Different strategies for different cities: The consid- erations are a city’s spatial form, land-use pattern, level of development, and the state of urbanisation. ○ The strategies include energy-efficient ser- vices and infrastructure, people-centric urban design, and implementing building codes while gradually shifting to low-emis- sion construction materials. ● For a just energy transition: The energy supply needs to be balanced against fast-growing energy demand, the need for energy security and exports. ● Mitigation and adaptation responses: Must engage multiple stakeholders in energy governance and de- cision-making, scaling up investments and capabili- ties, etc. Conclusion: ● In the upcoming G20 forum, India is planning to propose a multiple energy pathways approach to accommodate the diverse development trajectories of countries. ● The diversity of India’s States, which necessitates multiple pathways, will determine its own domestic energy transition. Insta Links: Low-cost finance for the energy transition re- port CLIMATE-RESILIENT AGRICULTURE Context: As climate change can reduce agricultural income by 15- 25%, it is high time that climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) is valued and implemented more rigorously. CRA: ● Resilience is the capacity of a system to dynamically respond to, recover from and even thrive in chang- ing climate conditions while maintaining essential functions, identities, and structures. ● Hence, CRA is an approach of sustainably using ex- isting natural resources to achieve long-term higher productivity and farm incomes under climate vari- abilities. Need: ● Extreme weather events → reducing farm produce, food price fluctuations → endangering food security and farm incomes. ● Hence, to address climate change and achieve SDGs, adaptation of appropriate mitigation technologies is required. Outcomes of CRA: ● Improved access and utilisation of technology, ● Increased use of resources conservation technolo- gies, ● An increased adaptation of crops and livestock to cli- matic stress, ● Reduces hunger and poverty (by sustaining agricul- tural production). Strategies and technologies for climate change adaptation: ● Tolerant crops: For example, early maturing and drought-tolerant green gram (BM 2002-1) was in- troduced by farmers in Aurangabad (MH). ● Tolerant breeds in livestock and poultry: Indigenous breeds are resistant to droughts, ability to ingest and digest low-quality feed, and resistance to diseases. ● Feed management: An adaptation measure, which www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 70 can indirectly improve the efficiency of livestock pro- duction. ● Water management/Water-smart technologies: Like micro-irrigation, cover-crop method, deficit ir- rigation, precision estimation of crop water needs, etc. ● Agro-advisory: Response farming (farming with ad- visories) is an integrative approach already been tak- en in states like Tamil Nadu. ● Different farm management practices - ○ Conservation agriculture technologies (re- duced tillage, crop rotations, and cover crops), ○ Soil conservation practices (contour farm- ing) and ○ Nutrient recharge strategies - can increase soil carbon stocks and stimulate soil func- tional stability.

REVIVING RUBBER INDUSTRY Context: India’s rubber industry is facing challenges as production falls behind growing demand. About Rubber: Status of the Rubber Industry: •\t World: As per 2019 data, Thailand is the largest producer of Rubber in the World followed by Indo- nesia, Malaysia, India, China etc. •\t India: India is the fourth largest producer and con- sumer of Rubber in the World. •\t History: The first rubber plantations in India were set up in 1895 on the hill slopes of Kerala. However, rubber cultivation on a commercial scale was intro- duced in 1902. •\t Distribution: Kerala (the largest producer of natural rubber in India); Tamil Nadu; Karnataka; Tripura, As- sam, Andaman and Nicobar, Goa etc are some other rubber-producing States. •\t Natural rubber is preferred over synthetic rub- ber due to its high tensile strength and vibra- tion-dampening properties, along with tear resis- tance. This makes it important for the construction and automobile industries. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 72 Key issues faced by the rubber industry in India: Issue Examples Falling rubber prices Prices have plunged from a peak of 540 cents/kg in 2011 to 130 cents/kg in re- cent years, discouraging rubber produc- ers and leading to the abandonment of plantations. High labour costs Labour-intensive activities like tapping rubber trees require skilled workers, but paying for labour amid falling prices has made rubber plantations financially unattractive. Import compe- tition Imports of rubber, usually available at lower prices than the domestic market, drive down prices and further discour- age domestic production. Pr oduc - tion-consump- tion gap The demand for natural rubber in India, primarily driven by the tire industry, has surged, creating a significant gap be- tween production and consumption. Climate change Changing weather conditions, influ- enced by climate change, pose chal- lenges to rubber farming, particularly in traditional cultivation areas like Kerala. Lack of techno- logical adoption Limited adoption of technological ad- vancements in the industry hinders pro- ductivity and competitiveness. Land conver- sion and frag- mentation Instead of finding ways to increase pro- duction, some rubber plantations are being sold or converted for other pur- poses, leading to the fragmentation of rubber holdings. Government’s initiatives in the Rubber sector: •\t Rubber Plantation Development Scheme: To sup- port the development of rubber plantations by pro- viding financial assistance to farmers •\t Rubber Group Planting Scheme: Financial incentive by the government to form rubber farmer groups and societies. •\t National Rubber Policy 2019: It includes provisions to support the natural rubber production sector and the entire rubber industry value chain. •\t Sustainable and Inclusive Development of the Nat- ural Rubber Sector (Implemented by the Rubber Board) for R&D in the rubber plantation. •\t 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Rubber Plantations allowed Steps that can be taken to revive the rubber industry in In- dia: Steps Examples Promote Re- search and Development Establish dedicated research institutes and labs for rubber, focusing on developing new varieties, improving cultivation tech- niques, and addressing climate change challenges. GM Rubber Rubber Board research farm is growing the world’s first genetically modified (GM) rubber plants, tailored for the climatic conditions of Northeast India. Enc o ur ag e the Adoption of Technolo- gy Promote the use of modern farming tech- nologies, such as rubber-tapping ma- chines and automation, to increase effi- ciency and reduce labour costs. Enhance Fi- nancial Sup- port and Sub- sidies Provide financial assistance, subsidies, and loans to rubber farmers for plantation es- tablishment, replantation, and adoption of modern cultivation practices. Improve In- frastructure and Logistics Establish rubber clusters and industrial parks to create a supportive ecosystem for rubber processing and value addition. Focus on Skill Development Collaborate with educational institutions and vocational training centres to offer specialized courses on rubber farming. St r en g t hen Market Link- ages Encourage tie-ups between farmers and rubber-based industries, such as the tire manufacturing sector, to ensure a steady demand and fair prices P r om otion of Rubber in India’s North East Four members of the ATMA in partner- ship with the Rubber Board have a plan to create 200,000 hectares of new rubber plantations in Northeast India and West Bengal. Conclusion: By implementing these measures, the rubber industry can regain its strength, boost production, and create a sustain- able and prosperous future for rubber farmers in India.

Announced by The Cabinet Committee on Economic Af- fairs (chaired by the PM) on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops. Background The MSP regime came into existence as a policy decision in 1967 [on the recommen- dations of the Food Grain Price Committee (constituted in 1964 under LK Jha)] and the government set up the Agricultural Prices Commission (renamed as the CACP in 1985) for fixing MSP for crops. Objectives A guaranteed price/safety net to prevent the farmers from distress sales and to pro- cure food grains for public distribution. Crops cov- ered 7 types of cereals (paddy, wheat, maize, ba- jra, jowar, ragi and barley), 5 types of pulses (chana, arhar/tur, urad, moong and masur), 7 oilseeds (rapeseed-mustard, groundnut, soybean, sunflower, sesamum, safflower, nigerseed) and 4 commercial crops (cotton, sugarcane [FRP], copra, raw jute) How is it calculated? The CACP considers both ‘A2+FL’ and ‘C2’ costs while recommending MSP. A2 costs cover all paid-out expenses, in- curred by farmers on seeds, fertilisers, etc. A2+FL covers actual paid-out costs plus an imputed value of unpaid family labour. The C2 costs account for the rentals and interest forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets respectively, on top of A2+FL. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 74 Concerns Not all crops benefit from MSPs: While around 45% of the paddy produced is pro- cured at MSP, it is about 25% in the case of cotton and only 1-3% in the case of pulses. Procurement is concentrated in only a few states: For example, Punjab, Haryana, western UP, Chhattisgarh and Telangana for paddy; Telangana and Maharashtra for cot- ton, etc. The majority of farmers remain uncov- ered: According to an NSSO, ~6% of Indian farmers have benefited directly from selling their wheat or rice under the MSP regime. Low MSP: For example, Maharashtra ex- pects a 10% fall in cotton acreage in the upcoming kharif season. This is mainly be- cause of the low MSP for cotton when com- pared with pulses (like tur) and soybean. Executing the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission half-hearted- ly: It recommended that MSP should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production. The announcement: ● The government announced that MSPs for the Khar- if season will go up by an average of 7%. ● This is the highest MSP increase in the last 5 years and the second highest in the last decade. The economic and political significance of MSP announce- ments: ● The economic aspect of MSPs is not limited to farmers alone. While a sharp rise in MSPs does al- leviate farm distress, it can also lead to a spike in food inflation. ○ Hence, there is a trade-off between the in- terests of the farmer and consumers. ● Closer to elections, it is natural for governments to announce high MSPs to win over the farmer’s vote. Challenges ahead: ● El Nino: Though the MSP hike is unlikely to spike in- flation by itself, food inflation may still spike if the normal monsoon is affected by El Nino. This may be a cause of worry for the Monetary Policy Commit- tee. ● For the government’s finances: Higher MSPs and more procurement as well as the storage and dis- bursal of subsidised food grains are all expenses that harm the financial health of the government. ● The impact of the MSP hike on the rural economy will be uneven: This is because the rural economy is lagging behind urban India (in consumption growth). About CACP: It is an attached office of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) was set up in 1965 to advise the Gov- ernment on the price policy of major agricultural commod- ities. Since March 1985, the Commission has been known as CACP. Insta Links: MSP Mains Links: Q. What do you mean by the Minimum Sup- port Price (MSP)?

(UPSC 2018) FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTORS (FPIS) Context: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has pro- posed additional disclosures from Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). FPI vs FDI (Foreign direct investment): FPI FDI Distinguish- ing features Does not give investors direct ownership of a company’s as- sets. Direct control/owner- ship in a business. Definition of FPI and FDI as per Arvind Ma y ar am C om m it t e e (2014) FPI results in an investor controlling less than 10% of the shares of the company. FDI results in an inves- tor controlling more than/equal to 10% of the shares of the com- pany. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 75 FPI regulation in India: ● FPIs are registered with SEBI and can invest in Indian securities as per the regulations prescribed by SEBI. ● The Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA) is the primary legislation governing FPI in India and has been amended several times to liber- alise FPI regulations in India. What are SEBI’s new proposals? ● The proposed legislation categorises FPIs into low risk, moderate risk, and high risk. ● The low risk would cover government and govern- ment-related entities such as central banks or sover- eign wealth funds. ● Moderate risk refers to pension funds or public re- tail funds with widespread and dispersed investors. ● All other FPIs are categorised as high-risk. Proposals for high-risk FPIs: ● Additional disclosure requirements for high-risk FPIs holding more than 50% of their equity asset un- der management (AUM) in a single corporate group. ● The existing high-risk FPIs with an overall holding in the Indian equity market of over Rs 25,000 crore comply with the disclosure mandate within six months. ○ Failing this, they would have to bring down their holding within the threshold. Exceptions: ● New FPIs would be allowed to breach the threshold criteria for up to a period of six months. ● ‘Moderate risk’ FPIs, whose India-oriented holdings are relatively small in comparison to their global portfolio, are not subjected to additional disclosure requirements. Need of the proposed regulations: ● Potential misuse of the FPI route for circumventing Press Note 3 stipulations (2020) that required an en- tity sharing a land border with India to involve in FPI only via the government route. ● Concentrated group investments by FPIs to bypass regulatory requirements (such as that for minimum public shareholding). Significance of the proposed regulations: ● They would try to identify tangible ownership and curtail incidences of multiple routes. ● This would enhance transparency and help avert regulatory requirements, and keep up with the min- imum (25%) public shareholding norms. Concerns: A detract from ease-of-doing investments. Insta Links: What FPIs’ market exit means Mains Links: Q. Justify the need for FDI for the develop- ment of the Indian economy.

Context: According to a recent study published in the Nature Jour- nal, the loss of Arctic Sea ice is expected to continue in the coming decades, even if carbon emissions are significantly reduced. What is Arctic Sea ice? Arctic sea ice refers to the frozen seawater that covers the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas during the colder months. It spreads over one-sixth of the earth’s landmass. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 76 Status: Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that the annual mean of Arctic Sea ice levels has been the lowest since at least 1850, while late summer levels have hit the lowest point in at least 1,000 years. The IPCC predicts that the Arctic will likely experience a practi- cally ice-free September at least once before 2050. The new findings: •\t The world will see its first ‘sea-ice-free sum- mer’ before 2050 (corroborating IPCC findings), possibly in the 2030s. •\t The global emissions will drive temperatures to be- yond 4.5°C making the Arctic ice-free by 2081-2100. •\t There is no scenario under which the Arctic Sea ice can be saved in summer. Factors Causing Rapid Melting of Ice: Arctic Amplification It refers to the phenomenon where the Arctic region experi- ences more rapid warming com- pared to the rest of the planet Albedo Feedback Loop Ice has high reflectivity (albedo) compared to land or water surfac- es. Decreased ice cover reduces Earth’s surface reflectivity, lead- ing to more absorption of solar ra- diation and surface warming Darker Ocean Surface Bright ice is being replaced by a darker open ocean surface in the Arctic. Less reflection of the sun’s radiation, resulting in additional heating and ice loss Melting permafrost As permafrost thaws, it releases stored greenhouse gases, such as methane, which contribute to ad- ditional warming. Atmospheric circula- tion patterns Changes in atmospheric circula- tion patterns can transport warm air into the Arctic, further raising temperatures and melting ice. Impact of Melting Arctic Ice: Description Global Climate Change Rising sea levels, salinity levels, and current and precipitation pat- terns Danger to Coastal Communities Increased risk of coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and storm surge for coastal communities Food Security Polar vortexes, heat waves, and unpredictable weather patterns due to ice loss can damage global crop production; Shifting fish spe- cies distributions and impacting the Arctic food web. Biodiversity Threat Melting Arctic ice threatens the biodiversity of the region, impact- ing species such as polar bears and altering the food web. Emerging Race Course Competition among countries like the US, China, and Russia for re- source extraction and influence in the Arctic region. Tundra Degradation Increasingly swampy tundra due to global warming is damaging permafrost Threat to Biodiversi- ty Polar bears and other Arctic spe- cies face challenges due to shrink- ing ice cover What can India do? India should aim to understand the dynamics of Arctic de- mography and governance, going beyond scientific explo- ration. With its growing stature in world affairs, India can become the voice of Arctic tribes and raise their issues in global forums. By actively engaging in Arctic affairs, India can leverage this opportunity to shape policies and contribute to discussions concerning the region’s future. Previously India unveiled India’s Arctic Policy document. Conclusion: The focus should be on establishing a global ocean treaty that addresses the governance of the oceans worldwide, and prioritize safe and sustainable exploration of resources. This treaty should aim to ensure collaboration and coopera- tion among nations. Insta links: India and the Arctic Mains Links: Q.

Background: The G7 Digital and Tech Ministers discussed re- sponsible AI and global AI governance - ● To promote human-centric and trustworthy AI based on the OECD AI Principles and ● To foster collaboration to maximise the benefits for all brought by AI technologies. What is HAP? ● It recognised the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors. ● It encourages discussions on generative AI in coop- eration with the OECD and GPAI to conduct practical projects. ● These discussions could include topics such as gov- ernance, safeguard of IPR (including copyrights), response to foreign information manipulation (in- cluding disinformation) and responsible utilisation of these technologies. Significance of the HAP: ● It will highlight the shared values and standards that can be used to derive guiding principles (fair- ness, accountability, transparency, and safety) for the regulation of AI. ● AI development and implementation will help in aligning with values such as freedom, democracy, and human rights. ● An emphasis on multi-stakeholder international cooperation indicates that the HAP is not expected to address AI regulation from a State-centric per- spective. Challenges: ● Divergence among G7 countries. ● G7 countries are acting on their own instead of waiting for the outcomes from the HAP. ● The relationship between AI and IPR is not clear. Way ahead: ● A common guideline for G7 countries that permits the use of copyrighted materials. ● An interoperable AI governance framework to re- spond to the concerns of other country groups as well. ● Like-minded approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI. Conclusion: Overall, the establishment of the HAP makes one thing clear: AI governance has become a truly global issue that is likely to only become more contested in future. Insta Links: Regulation of AI CONSEQUENCES OF SUBSIDIES Context: A new World Bank report highlights the negative conse- quences of inefficiently subsidising agriculture, fishing, and fossil fuel sectors. Highlights of the report: ● Subsidies in the 3 areas (generally considered to bail out economies in crises) exceeded $7 trillion, equivalent to 8% of the global gross domestic prod- uct (GDP). ● In 2021, countries shelled out $577 billion to actively lower the price of polluting fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. ● Agricultural subsidies (over $1 trillion globally) are targeted at farmers for buying specific inputs or growing particular crops. ○ However, these subsidies tend to favour wealthier farmers, even when programs are designed to be targeted to reach the poor. ● The fisheries sector receives 35.4 billion per year in subsidies and about $22.2 billion contributes to overfishing. Negative implications of subsidies: ● Exacerbate climate change: For example, fossil fuel subsidies incentivise the overuse of fossil fuels → lead to air pollution → high health burden. ● Dwindling fish stocks. ● Inefficient subsidy usage: It is responsible for ~17% of all nitrogen pollution in water in the past 30 years → Health impacts reducing labour productiv- ity by up to 3.5%. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 78 Positive implications of reducing subsidies: For example, a US$0.10 per litre increase in the average annual retail price of diesel may be associated with a decrease of 2.2 μg/m3 in the average annual concentration of PM2.5. Challenges: ● Demand for energy is less responsive to prices. ● Cleaner alternatives are not easily accessible and are sometimes not affordable. Way ahead: ● These subsidies could be repurposed to finance just transition activities or to provide a better quality of life, as they have far-reaching impacts on the envi- ronment. ● Diverting these subsidies to the financial allot- ments made towards commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. ● Ensuring the availability and affordability of clean technologies, addressing information and capacity constraints, and addressing behavioural biases are ways to increase the effectiveness of subsidy reform. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to redirect these subsidies to unlock significant funds for sustainable purposes. Insta Links: Understanding Subsidies in India Mains Links: Q.

(UPSC 2015) THE MARITIME INDIA VISION, 2030 Context: The global recognition of the operational efficiencies of Indi- an ports is an important step in India’s endeavour to become a global maritime power as envisaged in the Maritime India Vision (MIV), 2030. Global recognition of the Indian maritime/shipping sector: ● In the WB’s Logistic Performance Index (LPI) Report 2023, India has moved up to 22nd rank in the global rankings on the “International Shipments” category from the 44th position in 2014. ● The country has secured 38th rank on the LPI score. The reason for the improved performance: ● Substantial reduction in the dwell time at Indian ports: Dwell time (the amount of time vessels spend in port actively loading or unloading cargo) has reached an optimum level of about 3 days only as compared to 7 in the US and 10 in Germany. ● Improvement in port operational efficiency: The country’s average turnaround time (TRT) of only 0.9 days is amongst the best in the world (in Germany it is 1.4 days, in the US 1.5 days). What’s behind improved performance? ● Large investments in the upgradation of infrastruc- ture in the ports and shipping sector in the past few years. ○ As a result, the capacity at 12 major ports in the country has increased from 871 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2015 to 1,617 MMT in 2023. ● Consistent focus on: ○ Improvements in port efficiency and pro- ductivity through reforms, ○ Induction of new technologies, ○ A greater thrust on public-private partner- ship (~150% increase in the value of oper- ationalisation of PPP projects), ○ An overall commitment to the ease of doing business, and Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 79 ○ Decarbonisation (14-fold increase in the use of renewable energy in major ports) along with the Panchamrit commitments. Key policy and legislative reforms: ● The Harit Sagar Green Port guidelines: It aims to bring about a paradigm shift towards safe, efficient and sustainable ports while implementing sound en- vironmental practices among all stakeholders. ● The National Logistics Portal (Marine): It is a sin- gle-window digital platform for all stakeholders including those engaged in cargo services, carrier services, banking and financial services, and govern- ment and regulatory agencies. ● The Sagar Setu app: Facilitates seamless movement of goods and services in ports while substantially en- hancing the ease of doing business. ● The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021: It grants greater autonomy to major ports. ● The Marine Aids to Navigation Act, 2021: It pro- vides for increased safety and efficiency in vessel traffic services and training and certification at par with international standards. ● The Indian Vessels Act, 2021: It brings uniformity in law and standardised provisions across all inland wa- terways in the country. ● The Indian Ports Act, 1908: The government is in the process of replacing this with a piece of legislation that is in tune with present-day requirements. What is MIV 2030? ● To develop global standard ports in India, the Min- istry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways under the MIV 2030 has identified initiatives such as ○ Developing world-class Mega Ports, ○ Transhipment hubs and ○ Infrastructure modernization of ports. ● It estimates the investments to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000-1,25,000 crore for capacity augmentation and development of world-class infrastructure at In- dian Ports.

(UPSC 2013) UN ADOPTS FIRST EVER HIGH SEAS TREATY Context: The United Nations has adopted the High Seas Treaty, the first-ever international treaty aimed at protecting and gov- erning activities such as fishing, mining, and oil extraction in international waters. About the ratification: The treaty, officially known as the Biodiversity Beyond Na- tional Jurisdiction Treaty (BBNJ), has been signed by nearly 200 nations after 15 years of discussions. However, the trea- ty still needs to be ratified by at least 60 member nations to take effect. The next ocean conference in June 2025 in Nice, France, is expected to witness the completion of rat- ifications. Aim: Its purpose is to prevent species extinctions caused by overfishing, oil extraction, deep-sea mining, and other envi- ronmentally impactful activities on the high seas. Important features: •\t It establishes Marine protected areas (MPAs) and puts more money into marine conservation and new rules for mining at sea. •\t Arrangements for sharing marine genetic resources •\t Requirements for environmental assessments for deep sea activities like mining. •\t Richer nations have pledged money for the delivery of the treaty. •\t It also includes guidelines to measure the environ- mental impacts of high sea activities like fishing and mining and requires countries to present an assess- ment of those impacts to the UN about any activi- ties that the country is doing in international waters. •\t A new group called the Conference of Parties will oversee and enforce compliance with the treaty’s terms. BBNJ Treaty (Treaty of the High Seas) Information About It is a legally binding international agree- ment on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 80 It covers the high seas, beyond exclusive economic zones or national waters of coun- tries. These areas account for almost half of the Earth’s surface. Need Currently, only 1% of these areas are un- der protection. As of 2023, 90% of big fish populations are depleted and 50% of coral reefs are destroyed mainly due to overfish- ing.

What are the high seas? It refers to the areas of the world’s oceans and seas that are beyond any national ju- risdiction. These are the waters that do not fall under the sovereignty of any specific country. The high seas are collectively con- sidered a global common, belonging to all humankind. India India has been actively involved in the ne- gotiations for the development of an in- ternational legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of BBNJ under the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea (UNCLOS). About UN- CLOS The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982 is an international agreement that establishes the legal framework for marine and maritime activities.

What are Theatre Commands? A theatre command in the military refers to a specific geo- graphical area where military operations are planned, coor- dinated, and executed under a single command. It is a way of organizing and managing military forces within a particu- lar region or theatre of operations. ● The idea behind the Theatre Command System is to enhance coordination and synergy among the Army, Navy, and Air Force. ● Currently, almost all major countries like China, Rus- sia, the US, the UK, and France work on a theatre command concept. Case of China: ● China reorganised its 2.3-million People’s Liberation Army into five theatre commands in 2016 to en- hance offensive capabilities and establish improved command-and-control structures. ● Its Western Theatre Command looks after the entire border with India. Case of India: Why does India need theatre commands? ● India currently has 19 military commands. ○ 17 of them are service-oriented - 7 each for the Army and the Air Force and the Navy has 3. ○ A Tri-Service Command - Andaman and Nicobar Command, and the Strategic Forces Command (SFC looks after the country’s nu- clear stockpile). ● The aim is to bring all the individual commands into four or five unified or theatre commands to streamline military operations and enhance coordi- nation and efficiency in a rapidly evolving security landscape. ● This will aid in better planning, military response, and a unified approach to fighting future wars while also lowering costs. Case study - Acquisition of Apache attack helicopters from the US: ● While the Indian Air Force got 22 Apaches, the Army has also placed orders for six of these choppers. ● The end result is a loss of at least Rs 2,500 crore and haphazard operational planning. Steps taken towards theaterisation in India: ● The Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Con- trol and Discipline) Bill 2023 includes a provision regarding a joint services command. ● The cross-staffing initiatives are aimed at areas of commonality, such as equipment like UAVs and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles. ● Steps are being taken to introduce “common annual confidential reports” for all two and three-star gen- erals across the armed forces to synergise the ap- praisal system for tri-Service appointments. Progress in India’s theatre commands plans: ● A consensus has been reached among the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force regarding the plan. ● The revised proposal entails the establishment of 3 integrated theatre commands, each led by a senior 3-star general (Lieutenant Generals, Air Marshals, or Vice Admirals). ● These commands will be responsible for managing - ○ The northern borders with China, ○ The western front with Pakistan, and ○ The maritime command in peninsular India. ● The original proposal for an Air Defence Command (ADC) has been discarded since ‘air defence’ and ‘of- fensive air’ missions are interdependent and cannot be carried out in isolation during conflicts. ○ Therefore, air assets will not be owned by a theatre command but will shift from one to another based on the contingency faced. Way ahead: ● To get the most out of the theatre commands, a national security strategy and the right tri-service structures must be in place. ● The theatre commands should be future-ready to deal with the emerging forms of warfare in the space and cyber domains and should not increase the decision-making chains.

R e g ula t or y hurdles Navigating complex regulatory frame- works, compliance requirements, and bureaucratic processes can be challeng- ing for startups. Talent acquisi- tion and reten- tion Startups must find creative ways to at- tract top talent and provide an environ- ment that fosters growth and offers equi- ty-based incentives. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 83 Market com- petition Established companies and foreign com- petitors often have larger resources and market presence, making it difficult for startups to establish their brands, acquire customers, and differentiate themselves from competitors. Infrastructure limitations Issues such as unreliable power supply, limited internet connectivity, and inade- quate transportation systems can disrupt operations and impact productivity. Limited access to mentorship and network- ing The lack of established support systems can hinder their ability to navigate chal- lenges, learn from others’ experiences, and seize opportunities. Government’s Initiatives for Startups: National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innova- tions (NIDHI); Startup India Action Plan (SIAP); Ranking of States on Support to Startup Ecosystems (RSSSE); Startup In- dia Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS); National Startup Awards; SCO Startup Forum; Prarambh.

Need of the Pact: •\t According to One Planet Lab’s white papers released for the Summit, the scale of investment needed to meet the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, climate COP21 and Biodiversity COP15 objec- tives set at the global and national levels is to the tune of an additional $4 trillion every year. •\t Only 25% of global climate investment goes to South Asia, Latin America, and Africa, which house some of the most vulnerable regions. •\t Global funds clamp down on the fiscal indepen- dence of less developed countries by posing several conditions before the money comes in. Proposals for increasing Climate financing: •\t Rich Tax: A group of over 140 economists has writ- ten an open letter urging world leaders to impose a special tax on the wealth of the super-rich to raise funds for the Global South to address climate change impacts. They propose a 2% tax on extreme wealth, which could generate over $2 trillion annually. •\t The summit should include three components: o A pact for global finance flows at the domes- tic and international levels o A platform to de-risk finance and attract private investment in sustainable infrastruc- ture o A political pathway with time-bound deliv- erables on climate finance. •\t Other suggestions include: o Cancelling illegitimate debts o Withdrawing support for fossil fuel projects o Making polluting industries pay for damages Conclusion: The pact aims to bridge the gap between the funding re- quired to achieve global goals, such as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the actual funding available. It may in- volve innovative financial mechanisms, tax reforms, and in- ternational cooperation to ensure adequate and predictable financing for development priorities.

The objective of the conference: To chart out a massive and immediate climate action plan to keep alive any realistic chance of meeting the 1.5-degree or 2-degree Celsius tar- gets. The key issue at Bonn - Global Stocktake (GST): ● Mandated by the 2015 Paris Agreement, GST is an exercise aimed at assessing the progress in the fight against climate change, and deciding ways and means to enhance global action to bridge the ade- quacy gap. ● The Paris Agreement says GST must be conducted every five years, starting in 2023. Outcome: The Bonn conference produced a short framework on the elements to be included in the stocktake exercise. The bone of contention between the developed and devel- oping countries: Provisions related to finance and historical responsibility of the rich countries. Historical responsibility: ● A bulk of the accumulated GHGs, the reason for global warming, have come from a group of about 40 rich and industrialised countries, usually referred to as Annex I countries in the 1992 UNFCCC. ● This historical responsibility has been the basis for the differentiated burden-sharing between de- veloped and developing countries in the climate change framework. The argument of Annex I countries: ● Historical emissions happened at a time when there were - ○ No alternative to fossil fuel-based energy sources ○ Little understanding or consensus on the harm caused by GHGs. ● Since 1992, ○ ~57% of the CO2 emissions had come from non-Annex I countries. ○ ~70% of the incremental warming due to emissions from CO2, methane and sulphur dioxide had come from non-Annex I coun- tries. ● Hence, bridging the adequacy gap was not the sole responsibility of the developed nations. Finance and technology transfers: ● Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) - a tempo- rary emergency exercise focused only on increasing emission cuts, was set up at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 for climate action. ● Discussions at the MWP ran into trouble after devel- oping countries complained that developed coun- tries were yet to offer the enabling finance and technology transfers. ○ Developed countries are under an obliga- tion to support the implementation of cli- mate action plans of developing countries through money and tech transfers. Challenges ahead: ● Global emissions have to come down by 43% from 2019 levels by 2030 to keep alive hopes of meeting the 1.5-degree target (IPCC). ● Developing countries need as much as US$ 6 trillion between now and 2030 just to implement their cli- mate action plans. ○ The loss and damage needs of developing countries are assessed to be about US$ 400 billion every year. ○ Against this, even a minuscule US$ 100 bil- lion per year that the developed countries had committed to raising from 2020 is not fully available. Conclusion: The Summit for a New Global Financial Pact is an attempt at redirecting global financial flows and raising new money to fight climate change, and dealing with associated problems like biodiversity loss and poverty.

Describe the major outcomes of the 26th Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 85 session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFC- CC). What are the commitments made by India in this con- ference? (UPSC 2021) ISSUES WITH THE CLIMATE FINANCE MECHANISMS Context: The industrialised countries have not walked the talk of fi- nancing the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts of the poorer countries. Why does the burden lie on industrialised countries? His- torical responsibility ● A bulk of the accumulated GHGs, the reason for global warming, have come from a group of about 40 rich and industrialised countries, usually referred to as Annex I countries in the 1992 UNFCCC. ● The contribution of the poorer countries (the Global South) was negligible. ● Additionally, countries in the Global South were al- ready struggling to pay their external debt, exacer- bated by the pandemic. Mechanisms that made industrialised countries liable: ● The Kyoto Protocol (1997) recognised the “com- mon but differentiated responsibilities” in the fight against climate change. ● The Paris Agreement (2015) asked countries to set voluntary emission targets but required the richer countries to make financial transfers to the develop- ing economies. ○ It set a floor of $100 billion per year (that the developed countries had committed to raising from 2020) for these transfers. Concerns: ● In the definition of climate finance, commercial loans should not be counted. ● In 2020, $83 billion was paid into the climate fi- nance fund to be transferred to the countries of the Global South. ● Out of this, less than $25 billion was in the form of grants. Recent efforts to boost climate finance: ● New Global Financing Pact ● The EU has put forward a proposal, called the Car- bon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). CBAM: ● This involves imposing tariffs on imports from other countries that are seen to be using carbon-intensive methods of production. ● This mechanism, starting in 2026, will cover prod- ucts such as cement, steel, aluminium, oil refinery, paper, glass, chemicals, and electricity generation. The CBAM is expected to achieve three objectives: Reduce the EU’s emissions, for the EU not lose competitiveness in carbon-intensive goods and to make the targeted countries reduce the carbon intensity of their exports. Issues with CBAM: ● The CBAM is a unilateral move, against the spirit of multilateralism. ● It could be used for protectionism. ● Equity considerations, are designed to help rich countries avoid paying for creating the climate prob- lem. ● It targets production processes (not the product it- self) that the WTO does not approve of. How will it affect the Global South? This mechanism seeks to penalise “free riders” - one who is not contributing, al- though has the means to do so. Most affected: ● Only 3 of the 12 exporters to the EU have a mecha- nism for “pricing carbon”. ● The countries most affected will be Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, India, and China. Way ahead: ● A global price for carbon to redress the global “ex- ternality”. ● Clarity on the following before CBAM is implement- ed: ○ First, which countries will be exempt? These are likely to be those that possibly have a national emissions cap or a sectoral cap or are the poorest countries. ○ Second, which emissions are included in the levying of the import tax? ○ Finally, which products are to be included? Possibly, a narrow coverage with high trade and carbon exposure.

About the CSE report: The report highlights how various stakeholders procure, process and sell organic and natural produce while trying to ensure remunerative prices to farmers. Challenges faced by farmers: ● Lack of market access → unable to sell their pro- duce at a remunerative price. ● Lack of certification → detrimental to demands (do- mestic and exports) → becoming a barrier in India’s journey towards non-chemical farming practices. ● Organic farmers don’t get all the benefits conven- tional farmers get in terms of subsidies. Way ahead: ● Working with consumers for behavioural change to- wards organic produce (as in the case of millet). ● Coherence in the different certification systems like Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and third-par- ty National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification. ● Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) need gov- ernment support for working capital, dedicated in- frastructure, and support for capacity building. ● Expand value addition and move towards shorter supply chains for better price realisation by farmers. Some best practices from Himachal Pradesh: ● Prakritak Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana: To increase agricultural income by adopting ZBNF. The system will not only improve soil fertility but also discourage the use of fertilisers and pesticides and reduce envi- ronmental pollution. ● Subsidy: To promote organic farming in the state, the state government is providing a 50% subsidy to farmers for setting up vermicompost units. Conclusion: Unless farmers get assured access to the market to sell their produce at a remunerative price, the challenge of transition will remain difficult to overcome.

Emission norms in place: The MoEFCC made it mandatory (in 2015) for thermal power plants to install a flue gas desul- phurisation (FGD) system to remove sulphur dioxide from their exhaust. Status of implementation: ● Poor implementation of the sulphur dioxide emis- sions regulations. ● For example, ○ Only 5% of the country’s installed coal- based thermal power generation capacities had the FGD mechanism in place. (CSE) ○ 17% of the overall coal power capacity was still at the very initial stages of compliance. Regional data on implementation status: ● No plant in eastern India was found to be compliant with SO2 emissions norms. ● Maharashtra has the highest capacity to comply with the norms, followed by Gujarat, UP, Haryana and Tamil Nadu. What do these results indicate? ● The sector has been unwilling to comply with the central government regulations. Even new projects are not compliant with the SO2 emissions norms. ● This is despite the fact that the norms have been di- luted for several parameters and deadlines delayed since they were issued. Reasons for the delayed implementation of the norms: The sector’s dependency on the external market for some FGD components, the novelty of the technology for the Indian market and the COVID-19 pandemic. Impact of poor implementation: ● Sulphur dioxide released in the open (without desul- phurisation) causes pollution. ● When sulphur dioxide combines with water and air, it forms sulfuric acid, which is the main component of acid rain. ● Acid rain can cause deforestation, acidify water- ways to the detriment of aquatic life, and be detri- mental to human health (skin cancer). Challenges ahead: A total of 20 thermal plants are now being built with a combined capacity of 27.4 GW, which will likely be included in the national capacity by the end of 2027–2028. Way ahead: ● The latest National Electricity Plan (NEP) for 2022-32 has advocated for different standards for plants in different locations. ● The Government should not further extend the deadline for compliance. ● It should be mandatory for new units to install the FGD system, only then they can begin operations.

Rights and obligations under the Rules: ● It is the duty of every distribution licensee to supply electricity on request made by an owner or occupier of any premises in line with the provisions of the Act. ● It is the right of consumers to have minimum stan- dards of service for the supply of electricity from the distribution licensee. The changes made in the Rules: ● Introduction of Time of Day (ToD) Tariff, and ● Rationalisation of smart metering provisions. Introduction of Time of Day (ToD) Tariff: ● Rather than being charged for electricity at the same rate at all times of the day, there will be separate tar- iffs for peak hours, solar hours and normal hours. ● Tariffs during solar hours (8 hours in a day as speci- fied by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission) shall be 10%-20% less than the normal tariff. ● Tariffs during peak hours will be 10 to 20% higher. ● It shall be made effective immediately after the in- stallation of smart metres, for the consumers with- out smart metres. Applicable for: ● Commercial and Industrial consumers have Maxi- mum demand of 10 KW and above, from 1st April 2024 and ● For all other consumers except agricultural con- sumers, latest from 1st April 2025. Significance: ● The ToD is a win-win for consumers as well as the power system. ● For consumers: ○ The separate tariffs will send price signals to consumers to manage their load accord- ing to the Tariff. ○ With awareness and effective utilisation of the ToD tariff mechanism, consumers can reduce their electricity bills. ● For the power system: The ToD mechanism will also ensure better grid integration of Renewable Energy sources thereby facilitating faster energy transition for India. Current status of ToD mechanism: ● In India: Most of the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have already implemented ToD tariffs for the large Commercial and Industrial category of consumers. ○ Various statutory provisions already exist to enable and promote the implementation of ToD tariffs (i.e., Tariff Policy 2016, Electrici- ty Act 2003, and National Electricity Policy 2005). Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 89 ● Globally: It is recognised across electricity indus- tries, as an important Demand Side Management (DSM) measure to reduce the demand during peak periods. Amendment in smart metering provision: ● The government has simplified the rules for smart metering. ● To avoid inconvenience/harassment of the consum- ers, the existing penalties for an increase in con- sumer demand beyond the maximum sanctioned load/demand have been reduced. ● Post installation of a smart metre, no penal charges will be imposed on a consumer based on the max- imum demand recorded by the smart metre for the period before the installation date.

ROLE OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA IN DE-RISKING THE INDIAN ECONOMY Context: Assured irrigation access has made the two states (Punjab and Haryana) the most reliable producers of rice and wheat, which will matter in a bad monsoon year. Importance of Punjab and Haryana: Both have been India’s breadbasket and lynchpins of its food security, especially post the Green Revolution (the cul- tivation of high-yielding semi-dwarf varieties). The declining role of Punjab and Haryana: ● Over the last two decades, the two states’ combined share in total wheat procurement for the Central foodgrain pool has fallen from 90% to 70%. ● It’s been from 44% to 28% for rice. Reasons for this decline: ● The diversification of procurement. ● The state governments are also establishing infra- structure for the purchase of grain at minimum sup- port prices (MSP) from farmers. ● For example, ○ In wheat, MP overtook Punjab as the top contributor to the Central pool in 2019-20. ○ In rice, Telangana has emerged as a clear No. 2 behind Punjab. Challenges to these scenarios: ● Bad/subnormal monsoon: The contribution of most states to wheat procurement has tended to be low in poor monsoon years due to low harvests (kharif crops). ● El Niño forecast this year: It has been associated with monsoon failures in India (2014, 2015 and 2018 recorded subnormal rainfall as all three were El Niño years). ● Temperature spikes due to global warming. Impact of these challenges: ● Rice production may be worst affected, as it is high- ly water-intensive and requires at least 25 irrigations in the absence of rain. ● Wheat (rabi crop) production may also suffer, due to temperature spikes and because it is grown using groundwater and dam reservoirs that are recharged/ refilled during the monsoon. The saviour states - Punjab and Haryana: ● Farmers here have assured access to irrigation. ● For example, Punjab has 15 lakh electric tube wells and the state Punjab government is supplying 8 hours of uninterrupted free power daily to run these tube wells during the paddy season. Conclusion: ● Long-standing recommendations from policymakers and economists include weaning Punjab and Hary- ana farmers off of rice and reducing wheat acreage. ● But today, with poor government stocks and soar- ing rice prices, these very states come to the rescue once again de-risking the Indian economy.

(UPSC 2020) JOHN GOODENOUGH: CO-CREATOR OF THE LITHIUM-ION BATTERY Context: John Goodenough, the Nobel Prize-winning co-creator of the lithium-ion battery, passed away at the age of 100. Goodenough, Whittingham, and Yoshino received Nobel Prize in 2019 for Chemistry. Each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for developing a commercial re- chargeable battery. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 90 •\t The 1970s: Whittingham: Whittingham’s work in the 1970s harnessed the tendency of lithium — the lightest metal — to give away its electrons to make a battery capable of generating just over two volts. •\t The 1980s: Goodenough had built on Whittingham’s work and doubled the battery’s capacity to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode, one of the two electrodes that make up the ends of a battery. •\t The 1980s: Yoshino: That battery remained too ex- plosive for general commercial use. Yoshino’s work in the 1980s eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer. The first lightweight, safe, durable, and rechargeable commercial batteries entered the market in 1991. •\t In 2017, Goodenough led a team of engineers to develop the first all-solid-state battery cells that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars, and stationary energy storage. Significance: Li-ion batteries revolutionized technology by providing rechargeable power for various devices such as cellphones, computers, and electric cars. Working Principle of Li-ion batteries: Lithium-ion batteries work based on the movement of lith- ium ions between two electrodes, the cathode (positive electrode) and the anode (negative electrode), through an electrolyte. When the battery is being charged, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode, where they are stored. During discharge, the ions move back to the cath- ode, creating an electric current that can power devices. Difference between Sold-State Batteries and Lithium-Ion Batteries: Solid-State Batteries Lithium-Ion Batteries Use solid-state electro- lytes, which are non-flam- mable and safer Use liquid or gel electrolytes, which can be flammable Offer higher energy den- sity, allowing for a longer driving range Typically have lower ener- gy density compared to sol- id-state batteries Faster-charging capability Charging time is relatively lon- ger Longer cycle life Typically have a limited num- ber of charging cycles Can be made using earth-friendly materials Relies on the use of lithium, which may have supply con- cerns Require further develop- ment and commercializa- tion Widely used in portable elec- tronic devices and electric ve- hicles Higher cost due to the use of advanced materials Relatively lower cost and ma- ture manufacturing processes Conclusion: It’s important to note that solid-state batteries are still in the development and research phase, while lithium-ion bat- teries are widely used in various industries. Both Solid-state and lithium batteries hold great promise for the future and are a testament to John Goodenough’s work. Insta Links: New Electric Vehicle Batteries Mains Links: Q.

GLOBAL FINANCIAL PACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE: KEY TAKEAWAYS Context: Recently, a summit called the ‘Global Financial Pact on Cli- mate Change’ was held in Paris. Prior to the summit, we had covered expectation from it: Here. This article covers the agreements reached at the summit. Aim of the summit: To boost crisis financing for low-income states and ease their debt burdens, reform post-war financial systems and free up funds to tackle climate change. Outcomes of the summit: Description Additional lending capac- ity An additional lending capacity of $200 billion for Multi-Development Banks (MDBs) to support emerging econo- mies in addressing climate challenges. World Bank: Suspension of debt payment The World Bank announced disaster clauses for debt deals, suspending debt payments in case of extreme weather events, and providing financial relief.

Answer - A SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO STATES FOR CAPI- TAL INVESTMENT 2023-24 SCHEME Context: The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, has ap- proved capital investment proposals of Rs. 56,415 crore in 16 States in the current financial year. Approval has been given under: The scheme entitled ‘Spe- www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 92 cial Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24’. What is capital expenditure (capex)? ● It includes money spent by the government on the development/upgrading/repairing of physical as- sets (like health and education facilities), acquiring fixed and intangible assets, repayment of loans, etc. ● Capex of the government has been the prime driver in the economy (in recent years) because the private sector has not been in a position to invest due to poor demand and high inflation. ● In FY23, the Centre’s capital expenditure exceeded the government’s revised estimate of Rs 7.28 lakh crore by Rs 8,551 crore. Significance of capex: ● Long-term in nature, leads to the creation of assets and allows the economy to generate revenue for many years. ● Add or improve production facilities, increases la- bour participation, boost operational efficiency and raise the capacity of the economy to produce more in future. ● Repayment of loan reduces liability. Capex vs revenue expenditure: Revenue expenditure (sala- ries of employees, interest payment on past debt, subsidies, pension, etc) is recurring in nature and neither creates as- sets nor reduces any liability of the government. Concerns: Conflict between capex and public spending. For example, when capex was 14.2% of Budget Estimates in the FY 2019-20, the government had to cut public spending sharply in order to meet its deficit target. The Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24 Scheme About The scheme was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24 to give special assistance to the State Governments in the form of a 50-year interest-free loan up to an overall sum of Rs. 1.3 lakh crore during the FY 2023-24. Need It was launched in view of a higher multiplier effect of capital expenditure and in order to provide a boost to cap- ital spending by States. Background The scheme was first instituted in 2020-21 in the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The flexibility and simplic- ity of the scheme design have earned praise from States. Hence, a similar scheme was also executed by the Min- istry of Finance in the last financial year. Components Part-I is the largest component with an allocation of Rs. 1 lakh crore. It has been allocated amongst States in pro- portion to their share of central tax- es and duties as per the 15th Finance Commission. For Part–II, Rs. 3,000 crore has been set aside for providing incentives to States for scrapping State Government vehicles and ambulances, etc. Part–III & IV aims at providing incen- tives to States for reforms in Urban Planning and Urban Finance. Part V aims at increasing the housing stock for police personnel and their families within the police stations in urban areas.

According to a Bank of Baroda report, out of 25 states as many as 14 states met less than 75% of the target in FY2023. GLOBAL FOREST WATCH Context: A study quoted by the World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch reveals that tropical areas experienced a sig- Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 93 nificant decline in forest cover in 2022. Key findings: •\t The loss amounted to 4.1 million hectares, equiv- alent to an area the size of 11 football fields disap- pearing every minute. •\t The primary forest cover loss in tropical regions was 10% higher in 2022 compared to the previous year. •\t The study highlights that the world is not on track to meet its forest-related commitments: •\t Two key goals set by the World Resources Institute include ending deforestation by 2030 o However, the global deforestation rate needs to decrease by at least 10% annually to meet the 2030 target. o While deforestation rates reduced by 3.1% in 2022 compared to the 2018-2020 base- line, they still exceeded the necessary levels by over one million hectares, indicating a deviation from the 2030 goal. •\t Restoring 350 million hectares of lost and degraded forests by 2030. o The overall change in tree cover over the past two decades has been a net loss of 100 million hectares. This indicates that forests are still being lost instead of being restored at the required rate. •\t Countries like Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with substantial tropical forest cover, experi- enced significant losses in 2022. •\t India: The study also highlights India’s loss of 44 thousand hectares of humid primary forest between 2021 and 2022, accounting for 17% of the country’s total tree cover loss during that period. What are Primary forests? Primary forests, also known as old-growth forests or vir- gin forests, are mature and undisturbed natural forests that have not experienced significant human intervention or alteration in recent history. These forests have reached a stage of ecological maturity and exhibit a complex and diverse ecosystem with fully developed tree canopy layers, understory vegetation, and rich biodiversity. •\t Significance: They play a crucial role in storing carbon and supporting biodiversity. Once lost, the regrowth of secondary forests cannot match the ecological and carbon sequestration capabilities of primary forests. Global Forest Watch (launched 2014) is an open-source web application to monitor global forests in near real-time. GFW is an initiative of the World Resources Institute, with partners including Google, USAID, the University of Mary- land, Esri, Vizzuality and many other academic, non-profit, public, and private organizations.

About the Green Credit Programme (GCP): ● Under this, individuals, industries, FPOs, ULBs, gram panchayats and private sectors, etc., will be able to earn “green credit” for undertaking environ- ment-friendly actions. ● The green credits will be tradable on a proposed do- mestic market platform. ● It follows the principle of LiFE - Lifestyle for Environ- ment - to encourage sustainable lifestyles by driv- ing consumers/communities towards behavioural changes to incentivise environment-friendly practic- es. The overall administration of the scheme: It will be under the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education - an autonomous organisation/ governmental agency under the MoEFCC. 8 sectors/activities that can qualify for generating credits: Sectors Purpose Tree planta- tion-based Green Credit To promote activities for increas- ing green cover across the country through tree plantation and related activities www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 94 W a t er -b a sed Green Credit To promote water conservation, water harvesting and water use effi- ciency/savings, including treatment and reuse of wastewater Sustainable ag- riculture-based Green Credit To promote natural and regenerative agricultural practices and land resto- ration to improve productivity, soil health and nutritional value of food produced Waste manage- ment-based Green Credit To promote sustainable and im- proved practices for waste manage- ment, including collection, segrega- tion and treatment Air pollution re- d u ct i o n -b a sed Green Credit To promote measures for reduc- ing air pollution and other pollu- tion-abatement activities Mangrove con- servation and res- t ora tion-based Green Credit To promote measures for the con- servation and restoration of man- groves E c om ar k-base d Green Credit To encourage manufacturers to obtain an eco-mark label for their goods and services Sustainable build- ing and infrastruc- ture-based Green Credit To encourage the construction of buildings and other infrastructure using sustainable technologies and materials Objectives of GCP: ● To create a market-based (supply and demand) mechanism for incentivising voluntary environmen- tal actions/ individual or community behaviour. ● To encourage the private sector as well as other en- tities to meet their existing obligations, stemming from other legal frameworks. GCP vs carbon markets: Unlike carbon markets, where only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were traded, the GCP accounts for a wide range of actions and nowhere in the world such a wide range of actions are considered. Significance of the GCP: ● It’s a first-of-its-kind instrument that seeks to value and reward multiple ecosystem services to allow green projects to achieve optimal returns beyond just carbon. ● The scheme will allow project proponents to also ac- cess carbon markets additionally. Similar mechanisms elsewhere: In some countries (France, Germany and Sweden), social services generate credits - taking care of the elderly for a certain number of hours, for instance, gets one some credit that you can exchange in a salon. Concerns: ● The draft was a good statement of intent but its im- plementation would be extremely challenging. ○ This is due to the difficulty in establishing the equivalence between various actions. ○ For example, how much water one saved is equivalent to a tonne of CO2 prevented from emissions is difficult to establish. ● Monitoring, reporting and verification challenges. ● A strong risk of greenwashing - the appearance of doing a lot without actually achieving much benefi- cial impact. Way ahead: ● Capacity needs to be built to monitor these systems and prevent fraud. ● It will save resources that could be diverted to more transformational pollution control and biodiversity protection efforts.

CHALLENGES FACED BY INDIA’S BIOECON- OMY Context: India’s bioeconomy growth is not in sync with desired fund- ing and policy support. Bioeconomy: It is the economic activity involving the use of biotechnology and biomass in the production of goods, services, or energy. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 95 India’s bioeconomy: ● According to the DBT’s ‘Bioeconomy Report 2022’ report, India’s bioeconomy contributes 2.6% to the GDP and by 2030 it will be ~5% of the GDP. ● This ambitious leap of $220 billion in eight years will require aggressive investment and policy support. Concerns: ● Neither funding for the DBT nor its recent policies reflect any serious intention to uplift this sector. ● For example, ○ The current Budgetary allocation to the DBT is only 0.0001% of India’s GDP. ○ Also, policies that enable risk-taking appe- tite within Indian scientists to create an eco- system of innovation and industrial action, are missing. ○ Also, the alignment between biotechnolo- gy policies and economic goals is missing. Case study - Problems in the Guidelines for Genetically En- gineered (GE) Insects: ● Uncertainty of purpose ○ The guidelines emphasise that GE insects offer applications in various fields (such as human and livestock health; crop manage- ment; etc) uplifting the standard of living by ■ Reducing disease burden, ■ Enabling food security and ■ Conserving the environment. ○ However, the guidelines don’t specify the purposes for which GE insects may be ap- proved in India. ○ The guidelines only provide regulatory pro- cedures for R&D on insects with some ben- eficial applications. ● Uncertainty for researchers: ○ The guidelines are applicable only to re- search and not to confined trials or deploy- ment. ○ Once the insects are ‘made’ and tested in the laboratory, researchers can conduct tri- als with them on the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the MoEFCC. ○ Once deployed, GE insects can’t be recalled and unlike GM foods they are not amena- ble to individual consumer choice. ● Uncertainty of ambit: ○ The guidelines offer standard operating pro- cedures for GE mosquitoes, crop pests, and beneficial insects - but what ‘beneficial’ means, in the context of GE insects, is not clear. ○ The lack of clarity will impede funders and scientists from investing in this research. Way ahead: ● Further efforts are needed to attract private fund- ing for biotechnology R&D. ● Policies need to be significantly revised if biotech- nology is to be of any serious consequence to the economy. ● Both of the above are essential considering the im- portance of biotechnology to any pandemic pre- paredness efforts.

(UPSC 2019) DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR RESOURCE AD- EQUACY PLANNING FRAMEWORK FOR INDIA Context: The Ministry of Power, in consultation with the Central Elec- tricity Authority (CEA), has released draft Guidelines for Re- source Adequacy Planning Framework for India. About the draft guidelines: ● The guidelines have been formulated under the Electricity (Amendment) Rules 2022. ● Under the new framework, the distribution compa- nies (DISCOM) will create a report detailing ○ The expected demand, ○ The rate of demand growth, ○ The current contracted capacity, and ○ The amount of power obtained from power exchanges. ● The resource adequacy exercise will be conducted with a 10-year planning horizon on a continuous ba- sis. ● The National Load Despatch Center (NLDC) is re- quired to release an annual short-term national re- source adequacy plan covering one year. The objective of the plan: ● To reliably fulfil the peak demand with the help of adequate supply of generation and demand re- sponse. ● To optimise the generation of electricity at the low- est possible cost while meeting the demand. This includes minimising overall system costs, such as - ○ Operational and maintenance expenses, ○ Fuel costs, www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 96 ○ The costs associated with starting up and shutting down power-generating units, etc. ● To take into account various constraints related to power plant operations, such as - ○ Limits on ramping up or down generation, ○ Renewable purchase obligation (RPO) tar- gets, ○ Capacities for solar rooftop or distributed generation, etc. Significance: ● A set of guidelines to establish an institutional mechanism for resource adequacy, spanning from the national level down to the DISCOM. ● It will ensure the availability of resources at each level to meet the demand. ● It will help proactively assess the requirements for new generation capacities, energy storage, and oth- er flexible resources well in advance. Key challenges: ● The ongoing challenge of catering to the peak de- mand reliably is being faced by the utilities in India. ● Infrastructural and management challenges while sharing inter-state and inter-region power. ● Increasing share of variable renewable energy and higher frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change. Way ahead: ● Given the limited capacity and the learning curve as- sociated with the detailed resource adequacy plan, DISCOM be allowed a grace period of 2-3 years be- fore implementation of the same. ● Such a preparatory period would allow the discoms to explore the methodology, collect relevant data and put an internal institutional mechanism in place. Insta Links: Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022 THE OPEN MARKET SALE SCHEME Context: The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has imposed quantity re- strictions on states to procure two food grains (wheat and rice) through its Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). The issue related to the OMSS About OMSS Under the OMSS, the FCI sells (from time to time) surplus food grains (especially wheat and rice) from the central pool in the open market to traders, bulk consum- ers, and retail chains, at pre-determined prices. How? Through e-auctions, where open-market bidders can buy specified quantities. OMSS and States States are also allowed to procure food grains (over and above what they get from the central pool to distribute to NFSA ben- eficiaries) through the OMSS without par- ticipating in the auctions. Objective of OMSS Ensure food security by enhancing the supply of food grains during the lean sea- son, control inflation by moderating the open market prices, especially in the defi- cit regions Revision of OMSS The Centre decided to restrict the quanti- ty that a single bidder can purchase from 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) to 10-100 MT. The objec- tive behind the revision To accommodate more small and margin- al buyers, curb retail prices as allowing smaller bids should ideally break monop- olies of bulk buyers, allowing more com- petitive bids by small buyers. Impact of Revision on States The Centre stopped the sale of rice and wheat from the Central pool under the OMSS to State governments, also disal- lowing private bidders to sell their OMSS supplies to state governments. Steps Taken by States Considering alternative methods of ob- taining wheat and rice. For example, TN is trying to purchase rice from government agencies other than FCI. Allegations of States States such as Karnataka (which runs the Anna Bhagya scheme) and Tamil Nadu (which runs the universal PDS) have criti- cised the government for engaging in “pol- itics” at the expense of marginalised bene- ficiaries of State welfare schemes. Centre’s re- ply Restrictions are imposed to curb inflation and regulate supply. The Centre is already distributing grains to 80 crore marginal- ised beneficiaries under the NFSA. FCI: ● It is a statutory body set up setup under the Food Corporation Act 1964, in order to fulfil the following objectives of the Food Policy: ○ Effective price support operations for safe- guarding the interests of the farmers. ○ Distribution of food grains throughout the country for a PDS. ○ Maintaining a satisfactory level of opera- tional and buffer stocks of foodgrains to en- sure National Food Security. ● It comes under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 97 Food and Public Distribution, Government of India. ● Since its inception, FCI has contributed significantly to India’s success in transforming its food security system from one that was focused on crisis manage- ment to one that is stable.

(UPSC 2019) GS4 EU COMMISSION PROPOSES A COMMON ETHICS BODY Context: The European Union’s (EU) executive arm proposed to cre- ate an ethics body that would set up common rules of con- duct for institutions after the cash-for-influence scandal. •\t With the establishment of the Ethics Body there will, for the first time, be common standards for the eth- ical conduct of members and a formal mechanism for coordination and exchange of views on ethical requirements among institutions. The new Body will have three main tasks: •\t Develop common minimum standards – applicable to the members of participating EU Institutions and bodies, as well as update them when needed. •\t Exchange of views on each institution’s internal rules in light of the standards to allow them to learn and benefit from each other’s experience. •\t Promote a common ethics culture of all members of EU institutions, facilitating the public understand- ing of the framework both to those inside and out- side the institutions. Transparency will apply also to the application of these rules in the institutions. The standards will relate to several fields: •\t acceptance of gifts, hospitality and travel offered by third parties •\t conditionality and transparency measures, in particular for meetings with interest representa- tives: the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council already have common standards as regards meetings with interest representatives and their publication thanks to the Transparency Reg- ister. •\t interests and assets to be declared, establishing the categories, as well as the procedures applied to check these declarations. •\t side or external activities, in order to ensure that members’ availability and independence are not compromised. •\t post-mandate activities of former members, estab- lishing conditions, and transparency requirements. •\t implementation of the common framework, in- cluding monitoring compliance and follow-up, also as regards possible cases of harassment and sanc- tions, in case of breaches within each institution. •\t on the publicity of information: each institution will need to make public how they apply the standards. Other measures taken with respect to Ethical Standards: •\t Code of Conduct for the Members of the European Commission UNESCO TO DEVELOP AN ETHICAL FRAME- WORK ON NEUROTECH DEVICES Context: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or- ganization (UNESCO) is all set to host an international con- ference to develop an ethical framework for the usage of neurotech devices that feed brain-wave data to computers through dry electrodes and implants. •\t It will be guided by a report by UNESCO’s Interna- tional Bioethics Committee on the “Ethical Issues of Neurotechnology.” Neurotechnology could help solve many health issues, but it could also access and manipulate people’s brains, and pro- duce information about our identities, and our emotions. It could threaten our rights to human dignity, freedom of thought and privacy, •\t Neurotechnology covers any kind of device or pro- cedure which is designed to “access, monitor, in- vestigate, assess, manipulate, and/or emulate the structure and function of neural systems”. •\t Neurotechnological devices range from “wear- ables”, to non-invasive brain-computer interfaces such as robotic limbs, to brain implants currently be- ing developed with the goal of treating disabilities such as paralysis. RECENT EXAMPLES OF ETHICS Example 1: RWA in Bengaluru bars maids and servants from using of common area The notice issued by the housing society in Bengaluru, bar- ring maids from using common areas, raises several signifi- cant issues: The housing society said that “It is difficult to see them hang out everywhere in the park, amphitheatre, gazebos. Resi- dents can feel uncomfortable when being surrounded by maids everywhere we walk.” Ethical Issues with such notice: •\t Elitist Attitude: The notice reflects an elitist up- www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 98 per-class attitude towards workers, particularly do- mestic helpers. •\t Casteism and Class Prejudice: The notice suggests the presence of casteism and class prejudice within society. •\t Imposition of Will: The notice illustrates how the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) can exert their power and impose its decisions on marginalized in- dividuals who lack the means to voice their objec- tions. •\t Corruption of Petty Power: The notice exemplifies how those with limited authority can abuse their po- sition and use it to enforce discriminatory practices. Example 2: Rehana Fathima Case Fathima, a female rights activist, faced multiple charges un- der various laws for posting a video showing her 14-year-old son painting on her. The video sparked outrage and accusa- tions of obscenity on social media. In a recent Kerala High Court Judgment, the court observed that “The right of a woman to make autonomous decisions about her body is at the very core of her fundamental right to equality and privacy. It also falls within the realm of per- sonal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.” The example emphasizes that notions of social morality are subjective and vary among individuals and communities. Actions that may be considered morally wrong by some may not necessarily be legally wrong, highlighting the distinction between morality and criminality. Example 3: Role of Parent in inculcating values: In 2023, American President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of tax fraud, and Jackie Chan’s son for drug offences. On a positive note, R.Madhwan’s son won 5 gold in Asian Swimming competitions, and Ravi Kishan’s daughter joins the defence service. These events highlight the significance of parental influence in shaping a child’s upbringing, instilling values, and safe- guarding them from negative influences. Example 4: John B. Goodenough, co-creator of Lithium Ion Batteries passed away recently. He demonstrated several ethical values through his work and actions: •\t Sharing knowledge: Goodenough shared his pat- ents and collaborated with other researchers, high- lighting his commitment to advancing scientific knowledge and promoting collective progress over personal gain. •\t Philanthropy: He donated the stipends he received from his awards and scholarships, demonstrating a spirit of generosity. •\t Environmental consciousness: Goodenough’s work on lithium-ion batteries contributed to the develop- ment of clean energy solutions. •\t Integrity and humility: Despite his significant achievements and recognition, Goodenough re- mained humble and did not seek personal royalties or fame. •\t Contribution to society Example 5: V.K. Pandian, an influential bureaucrat and the private sec- retary to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has become a target of criticism from the opposition and certain factions within the BJD party. The complaint raised concerns about his use of state trans- portation, public receptions, and announcements of new projects, suggesting a violation of All India Services (Con- duct) Rules. The elaborate security measures and protocols accompa- nying Mr Pandian’s visits resemble those of chief ministers and union ministers, blurring the line between a politician and a bureaucrat. Ethical Issues concerned: Ethical Issues Description Violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules Concerns about adherence to ethical standards are expected from govern- ment officials such as Anonymity. Blurring of Lines between Poli- ticians and Bu- reaucrats The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’s visits, similar to those of chief minis- ters and union ministers, raise ethical questions regarding the distinction be- tween political and bureaucratic roles. Concentration of Power Ethical considerations related to ac- countability, transparency, and demo- cratic principles. Favoritism and Nepotism The close association between Mr Pan- dian and the Chief Minister, as well as the allegations of him being a “gate- way” to the Chief Minister, may raise ethical concerns related to favouritism, preferential treatment, and equitable distribution of opportunities and re- sources. Example 6: Discrimination in Cricket The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has issued an apology following a report that revealed systemic discrim- ination within English cricket. The report, conducted by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), high- lighted instances of racism, sexism, and class-based discrim- ination within the sport. The ECB expressed remorse for failing to prevent these forms of discrimination and acknowledged the need for significant changes. The report made 44 recommendations Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 99 for reform, including equal pay for male and female interna- tional players by 2030.

Example 8: Lessons on Emotional Intelligence in Cricket Test cricket, unlike most other sports, requires long-term, targeted behaviour and provides insights into how the mind experiences time, reward, threat, and anxiety. Understanding our ABCs (alarm-beliefs-coping) and manag- ing our mind’s reaction to time is crucial in cricket and life alike. Being emotionally intelligent helps players better their performance and reduce anxiety. Values extracted: •\t Self-awareness (recognizing and understanding one’s own emotions) •\t Self-regulation •\t Building resilience to anxiety through cognitive reat- tribution training (CRT); •\t Being flexible and adaptable in response to chang- ing circumstances, and developing strategies to cope with anxiety and negative emotions •\t Recognizing how anxiety can elongate the percep- tion of time and impact sleep, diet, and emotional stability, and managing it effectively. NEW DRUGS AND CLINICAL TRIAL RULES (2023) Context: The government of India recently passed an amendment to the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules (2023) that per- mits researchers to utilize non-animal and human-relevant methods for testing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. •\t It will amend the Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 Alternative methods proposed are 3D organoids, 3D bio- printer, organs-on-chip, and advanced computational meth- ods. To know the process of Clinical Trials in India: Click Here The use of animals in drug testing has limitations: Limitations Description Example Limited predict- ability for human response Animals may re- spond differently to drugs compared to humans due to differences in bio- logical processes, genetics, and other factors. The drug Thalidomide caused severe birth defects in humans but did not produce the same effects in ani- mal tests, leading to tragic consequences. Ethical Concerns and animal welfare Animal testing in- volves the use of sentient beings and raises ethical con- cerns regarding the suffering and harm caused to animals. This includes pro- cedures such as force-feeding, injec- tions, and euthana- sia. The Draize test, which involves applying sub- stances to animals’ eyes, has been criti- cized for causing se- vere pain and distress. The high failure rate in translating to human efficacy Despite passing an- imal testing, many drugs fail during hu- man clinical trials, leading to wasted re- sources and poten- tial harm to human participants. For instance, a study published in the Brit- ish Medical Journal found that over 90% of drugs tested on an- imals fail to translate into safe and effective treatments for hu- mans. Inade- quate represen- tation of human diversity Animals used in test- ing may not accu- rately represent the diversity of human populations in terms of age, sex, genetic variations, and un- derlying health con- ditions. For example, the drug Ximelagatran showed promise in animal studies but caused liver damage in hu- mans, highlighting the need for more accu- rate models. Regulatory and legal consider- ations The use of animals in testing is subject to regulatory re- quirements and eth- ical considerations, which can lead to de- lays, increased costs, and challenges in ob- taining approvals. The European Union has implemented a ban on animal testing for cosmetics. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 100 Ethical Issues Related to the Use of Animals in drug testing: Ethical Dilemma Description Animal Suffering Animal experimentation often involves causing pain, distress, or harm to the animals, raising concerns about their welfare and the ethics of inflicting suf- fering on them. Moral Status of Animals The debate centres around the moral consideration and rights of animals. Some argue that animals have inherent value and should not be subjected to experimentation, while others believe that human benefits justify their use. Balancing Hu- man Benefits The dilemma arises when weighing the potential benefits to human health and well-being against the harm caused to animals. Ethical considerations involve determining if the benefits are signifi- cant enough to justify the use of ani- mals in experiments. Informed Con- sent and Volun- tary Participa- tion Unlike human clinical trials where par- ticipants can provide informed consent, animals have no agency or ability to voluntarily participate in experiments, raising questions about the ethics of subjecting them to testing without their consent. Steps by Other Countries: •\t In 2021, the European Union passed a resolution on an action plan to facilitate the transition towards technologies that don’t use animals in research, regulatory testing, and education. The U.S. passed the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 in December 2022, allowing researchers to use these systems to test the safety and efficacy of new drugs. •\t Also, in 2022, South Korea introduced a Bill called ‘Vitalization of Development, Dissemination, and Use of Alternatives to Animal Testing Methods’. •\t In June 2023, Canada amended its Environmental Protection Act to replace, reduce or refine the use of vertebrate animals in toxicity testing. Conclusion: Thus the use of non-animal methods is significant for avoid- ing these ethical dilemmas. However, India faces challenges in terms of interdisciplinary expertise and the availability of resources for research in this area. Efforts are being made to establish centres of excellence and develop an end-to-end ecosystem in India to support the implementation of these new technologies.

SOCIALISM Context: The article discusses how socialist tendencies can have unintended consequences, concen- trating wealth rather than spreading it and favouring inheritors over entrepreneurs. What is Socialism? Socialism is an economic and political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership and con- trol of resources, means of production, and wealth distribution. It aims to create a more equitable society by reducing inequality, promoting social welfare, and ensuring that resources are allocated based on societal needs rather than individual profit. Issues: Countries with deep socialist roots, including France, Sweden, Russia, and India, are among those where the risk of protests against billionaires is high. This highlights the paradox that socialist-leaning countries can still experience a concentration of wealth and dissatisfaction with perceived inequality. Example: France is a country vulnerable to anti-rich populist revolts due to the rapid rise of billionaire wealth, particularly in family firms like LVMH. Recent protests in France targeted billionaires, including LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who has become a symbol of the perceived wealth disparity. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 112 AFFIRMA- TIVE ACTION IN HIGHER EDUCATION The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled to strike down race-conscious policies in college admissions, bringing an end to affirmative action in higher education. Affirmative action refers to admissions pol- icies that aim to increase the representation of minority students, such as Black and Hispanic stu- dents, on college campuses. Many colleges and universities consider race as part of a holistic approach to admissions, along with other factors like grades and extracurricular activities, to promote diversity and enhance the educa- tional experience. Reason for such a decision: US Supreme Court has narrowly emphasized individual rights and equal treatment over considerations of historical disadvantage or societal diversity. Impact: The impact of this ruling will lead colleges to explore new strategies to ensure diversity in their student populations. Also, Indian Students will be affected as well. PAINTING ROOFS WHITE Extreme heat in Indian slums is negatively affecting women’s health and productivity. To address this issue, the Mahila Housing Trust (MHT), a non-profit organization, has introduced a simple solu- tion: painting roofs with white solar-reflective paint.

Measures such as constructing rooftop collection systems, percolation tanks, and check dams were implemented to capture rainwater and replenish the groundwater table. River rejuvenation, canal desilting, and removal of encroachments were also undertaken. Community participation and awareness campaigns played a crucial role in fostering a water conser- vation culture. USING PHYSICS TO UNDER- STAND HATE GROUPS ON THE INTER- NET Scientists have developed a new approach to understanding online hate communities using mathe- matical equations commonly used to describe shock waves in fluids. The study found that online hate communities, or “anti-X” communities, grow rapidly due to fusion, where interested individuals or groups join them. The study’s findings have implications for identifying and combating hate speech, as tracking net- works of known hate speech offenders can be more effective than focusing on individual instances of hate speech.

About the incident: The Pietermaritzburg Railway Station incident occurred on June 7, 1893, when Mahatma Gandhi, a young lawyer at the time, was evicted from a first-class train compartment in South Africa. The incident was a result of racial discrimina- tion, as non-whites were not allowed in first-class compart- ments. Significance of the incident: The Pietermaritzburg Railway Station incident holds great significance as it marked a turning point in Mahatma Gand- hi’s life and his fight against racial discrimination. This inci- dent became a catalyst for Gandhi’s activism and played a pivotal role in shaping his approach towards social and polit- ical change, ultimately influencing the Indian independence movement. In 1997, former South African President Nelson Mandela conferred the ‘Freedom of Pietermaritzburg’ posthumously on Gandhi. MAGNETITE-BEARING ROCKS Context: The Bihar government plans to collaborate with the Geolog- ical Survey of India (GSI) to gather valuable geological infor- mation about magnetite-bearing rocks and ultramafic rocks in the region. What are magnetite-bearing rocks? Magnetite-bearing rocks are rocks that contain magnetite, a black, opaque, and magnetic mineral.

CYCLONE BIPARJOY Context: A cyclonic storm, named Biparjoy, has developed in the Ara- bian Sea. •\t ‘Biparjoy’ was suggested by Bangladesh and the word means ‘disaster’ or ‘calamity’ in Bengali. About Cyclones: A cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm waters. Usually, a high temperature anywhere means the ex- istence of low-pressure air, and a low temperature means high-pressure wind. How are cyclones named? Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 115 The naming of cyclones is done by countries on a rotational basis, following certain existing guidelines. •\t Worldwide, there are six regional specialised mete- orological centres (RSMCs) and five regional Tropi- cal Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs) mandated for issuing advisories and naming of tropical cyclones. •\t IMD is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cy- clone and storm surge advisories to 13 member countries under the WMO/Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) Panel includ- ing Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. HOMO NALEDI Context: Palaeoanthropologists have uncovered evidence that sug- gests that Homo naledi, an extinct human species, may have buried their dead and carved meaningful symbols in a cave. •\t These behaviours were thought to be unique to our own species – Homo sapiens – and the Neander- thals. The debate around burying the dead is based on differences between what scientists called mortuary behaviour and fu- nerary behaviour. •\t Mortuary behaviour is evident among chimps and elephants, for example, when they keep watch over a dead body or physically interact with it, expecting it to come back to life. •\t Funerary behaviours, on the other hand, are so- cial acts by creatures that are capable of complex thought and understand them to be separate from the rest of the natural world. They understand the significance of what death is. BAGH PRINT Context: Madhya Pradesh Women learn to make Bagh print bags un- der the ‘Safe Tourist Places project’.

Context: The Chandigarh-Manali highway was blocked following flash floods and landslides in parts of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. What are flash floods? ● Excessive or continuous rainfall over a period of days or during particular seasons, can lead to stag- nation of water and cause flooding. ● Flash floods occur in a much shorter span of time (say, when rainfall creates flooding in less than 6 hours) and are highly localised. ● Flash floods can also be caused by factors apart from rainfall, like when a dam overflows. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 123 Causes of flash floods in India: ● Nearly 75% of the total rainfall is concentrated over just four months (June to September) → rivers wit- ness a heavy discharge during these months. ● Cloudbursts or thunderstorms and overflowing glacial lakes (in Himalayan states formed due to the melting of glaciers). ● Depression and cyclonic storms in the coastal areas of Orissa, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. ● Flash floods may begin to take place after wild- fires. Wildfires destroy forests and other vegetation, which in turn weakens the soil and makes it less per- meable for water to seep through. ● Climate change/global warming has increased the frequency/numbers of the above events. What makes flash floods very dangerous? ● These are accompanied by landslides, which are sudden movements of rock, boulders, earth or de- bris down a slope. ● Landslides are common in mountainous terrains, where there are conditions created for them in terms of the soil, rock, geology, and slope. Vulnerability of India: ● According to government data, India is the worst flood-affected country in the world, after Bangla- desh. ● ~40 million hectares of land in the country are liable to floods annually. (National Flood Commission) ● India accounts for one-fifth of the global death count due to floods. ● Flash floods have been commonly witnessed in cit- ies like Chennai and Mumbai. Steps taken: India has launched first-of-its-kind Flash Flood Guidance ser- vices for India and other South Asian countries - Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Way ahead: A comprehensive strategy of monitoring, plan- ning development works in a way that is sensitive to the re- gion’s ecology, and mitigation to reduce the extent of dam- ages.

What is tectonic deformation? Tectonic deformation refers to the changes in the Earth’s crust caused by the movement and interaction of tectonic plates. It includes processes such as folding, faulting, and up- lift, which shape the Earth’s surface and give rise to features like mountains, valleys, and earthquakes. Findings: •\t The study focused on the Piedmont zone (transi- tion area between the mountains and the adjacent plains) between the Ghaggar and Yamuna River ba- sins and found clear evidence of ongoing tectonic activity. •\t This active deformation has the potential to turn the Piedmont zone into a future seismic hazard area. •\t The research also suggests that this tectonic activ- ity may have played a role in the extinction of the Vedic Saraswati River that once flowed through the region. Significance of the finding: The findings highlight the need for further investigations, including paleoseismic studies and SAR interferometry, to better understand the region’s stress distribution and strain accumulation. Fault lines in the Himalayas: •\t HFF (Himalayan Frontal Fault): It is a major thrust fault at the front of the Himalayas, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Eurasian plate. •\t MBT (Main Boundary Thrust): It is a significant fault in the Himalayas, marking the boundary between the Lesser Himalayas and the Sub-Himalayas. •\t MCT (Main Central Thrust): This fault separates the Lesser Himalayas from the Greater Himalayas and is responsible for the uplift of the Greater Himalayas.

GS2 ADVERSE POSSESSION Context: The Law Commission, in its recent report, stated that no changes in the law relating to adverse possession are re- quired. About Adverse possession: Topic Information Adv e r se Possession It refers to the hostile possession of the property, where a person can become the owner of the land if they possess it openly and continuously for a specified period of time. The concept stems from the idea that land must not be left vacant but instead, be put to judicious use. Example If Person A neglects their land, Person B can take care of it and treat it as their own. If Person B remains unchallenged on the land for the required period, they may claim le- gal ownership through adverse possession. Origin The concept dates back to ancient times and has its roots in the development of stat- utes of limitation in England. Legal Provi- sion The Limitation Act of 1963 shifted the bur- den of proof to the person claiming adverse possession. Possession for 12 years on pri- vate land or 30 years on government land can lead to ownership. Supr e m e Co u rt ’ s View The Supreme Court recommended changes to the law, considering it harsh for true own- ers and a windfall for dishonest individuals. It burdens the courts and promotes false claims without hindering rights or neglect- ing land resources. SC Test for ‘ Adv e r se Possession’ (2004) To claim adverse possession, a person must show the date of possession, nature of possession, whether the other party knew about it, how long the possession has con- tinued, and that it was open and undis- turbed.

INDIA’S PREFERENTIAL SCHEME FOR LDCS Context: According to a report by the LDC Group at the World Trade Organization (WTO), approximately 85% of the 11,000 prod- ucts offered at zero tariffs by India to least developed coun- tries (LDCs) under the duty-free quota-free (DFQF) scheme remain unutilized. About the duty-free quota-free (DFQF) scheme : Aspect Information About the scheme The Scheme requires all developed and developing country members to provide preferential market access for all products originating from all LDCs. Origin The decision to provide duty-free quota-free (DFQF) access for LDCs was first taken at the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in 2005. India India became the first developing country to extend this facility to LDCs in 2008, pro- viding market access to 85% of India’s to- tal tariff lines to better integrate LDCs into the global trading system and improve their trading opportunities. Expansion The scheme was expanded in 2014, provid- ing preferential market access on over 98% of India’s tariff lines to LDCs. India offers 11,506 preferential tariff lines to LDCs, of which 10,991 are duty-free. Reasons for low utiliza- tion Lack of awareness among exporters about the scheme and its benefits. Incomplete or inaccurate data regarding uti- lization rates. Significant amounts of LDC exports enter- ing India under non-preferential (most fa- voured nation) tariff route, despite being covered by DFQF.

What is Shanan hydropower project? The Shanan hydropower project (on the Uhl River, a tribu- tary of the Beas River ) is a 110 MW power project located in Mandi district, Himachal Pradesh, India. It was commis- sioned in 1932 and is currently under the control of the Pun- jab Government. What is the controversy? The 99-year lease on the project is set to expire in March 2024, leading to a dispute between Himachal Pradesh and Punjab over its ownership and control. Himachal Pradesh has made it clear that it will not renew or extend the lease and wants the project to be handed over to the state. Pun- jab, on the other hand, is unwilling to part with the project and is prepared to pursue legal action to retain it. GOVT BANS 14 FIXED-DOSE COMBINATION DRUGS Context: The government has banned 14 fixed-dose combination drugs citing there is “no therapeutic justification” for these medicines and that they may involve “risk” to people. •\t The decision was taken on the basis of the recom- mendations of an expert committee and the Drugs Technical Advisory Board. •\t Prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of this FDC was done under section 26 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, of 1940. About Fixed Dose Combination drugs: Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) drugs are medications that contain two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in a single formulation, to enhance therapeutic out- comes or simplify treatment regimens. Example: Augmentin: contains amoxicillin (anti-bacterial drug) and clavulanic acid (enhances absorption of amoxicil- lin) In 2016, the government announced the ban on the man- ufacture, sale and distribution of 344 drug combinations after an expert panel, set up at the behest of the Supreme Court had stated they were being sold to patients without scientific data and the order was challenged by the manu- facturers in court. •\t The currently banned 14 FDCs are part of those 344 drug combinations. Just read their names once as UPSC may ask these as terms in news - The combination drugs that have been banned include nimesulide and paracetamol dispersible tablets; chlorphe- niramine maleate and codeine syrup; pholcodine, pro- methazine, amoxicillin and bromhexine and bromhexine dextromethorphan, ammonium chloride, menthol; parac- etamol with bromhexine and phenylephrine, chlorpheni- ramine, guaiphenesin; and salbutamol and bromhexine. PET COKE Context: The government permitted the import of Needle pet coke for making graphite anode material for lithium-ion batter- ies as a feedstock and not for any other purposes. •\t Import of pet coke for fuel purposes is completely banned. However, the sulphur content in the NPC should be less than 0.8 per cent, which would be monitored by state pol- lution control boards. About Pet Coke: Petroleum coke (pet coke) is a carbon-rich solid material derived from the final cracking process, a thermo-based chemical engineering process that splits long-chain hydro- carbons of petroleum into shorter chains. As the world’s largest consumer of pet coke, India imports over half its an- nual pet coke consumption, mainly from the USA. About Needle Pet Coke: Needle pet Coke differs from regular petroleum Coke in its unique physical and chemical properties. It is called “nee- dle” coke because of its needle-like structure, which is formed during the refining process. This structure gives it certain advantageous properties that make it suitable for specific applications. •\t One of the primary uses of needle pet coke is in the production of graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces for steelmaking. The needle-like struc- ture of NPC provides excellent electrical conductiv- ity and high strength, making it ideal for manufac- turing high-quality electrodes. These electrodes are crucial for the efficient melting and refining of steel. •\t Needle pet coke is also used in other applications that require high-performance carbon materials, such as in the production of lithium-ion batteries, aerospace components, and certain carbon prod- ucts used in the chemical industry. The harmful effect of Pet Coke: Pet coke combustion emits significant amounts of green- house gases and air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 137 (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. Pet Coke has a high carbon content and a low energy value com- pared to other fossil fuels.

PHAGE THERAPY Context: A study conducted by the University of Exeter shows that the public is aware of and accepts the use of bacteria-killing viruses, known as phage therapy, as an alternative to antibi- otics. What is Phage therapy? Phage therapy is a treatment approach that uses bacterio- phages, which are viruses that infect and kill specific bac- teria. It involves using these viruses to target and destroy bacterial infections, serving as an alternative to antibiotics. How do they function? Phage are highly specific in their action, targeting only the specific bacteria they are programmed to attack, which can potentially reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance. Phage therapy has gained attention as a potential solution for anti- biotic-resistant infections and is being explored as a promis- ing avenue in medical research. What are Bacteriophages? Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and use them as hosts for their replication. They are highly diverse and can target different types of bacteria. It was discovered by Frederick Willian Twort in 1915 (Great Britain) and Felix d’Herelle in 1917 (France). www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 138 What is Antibiotic Resistance? Antibiotic resistance refers to the ability of bacteria or other microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, mak- ing them ineffective in treating infections caused by these resistant bacteria. By 2050, antibiotic resistance will result in the death of 10 million people from drug-resistant diseases every year CO2: RECORDS BREACHED Context: According to scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmo- spheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the Earth’s atmosphere have spiked over 50% since the beginning of the industrial age. •\t The annual increase in CO2 levels peaked at 424 parts per million in May, indicating a continuous rise not seen in millions of years. About Keeling Curve: The Keeling Curve is a record of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations measured at the Mauna Loa Obser- vatory in Hawaii.

The Plan: The Ocean Census plans to conduct multiple expeditions to marine biodiversity hotspots, with the first expedition al- ready underway in the Barents Sea. The initiative seeks to build upon previous efforts such as the Challenger Expedi- tions and the Census of Marine Life (between 2000 to 2010). Implemented by: It is jointly established by The Nippon Foundation (a non-profit philanthropic organization in Japan) and Nekton Foundation (marine science and conservation institute in the U.K) to discover unknown marine life Why is the U.S. SEC cracking down on crypto exchanges? Context: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges. The SEC filed over a dozen charges against Binance, alleg- ing the exchange commingled billions of dollars of investors’ funds and routed them to a company in Europe. •\t The regulator claimed that Binance allowed high-value U.S. customers to access its internation- al platform, misled investors about trading controls, and commingled customer funds. The SEC has been pushing for crypto businesses and trading platforms to register with the regulator for investor protec- tion and transparency. However, industry leaders have been cautious about negotiating with the SEC due to its history of legal action against cryptocurrency companies. The SEC’s aim seems to be bringing crypto exchanges under U.S. se- curities law. Its Impact: •\t The SEC’s actions against Binance may unsettle U.S.- based crypto traders who use its services and want to invest legally. •\t These events could have an impact on the crypto- currency market. STEEL PRODUCTION IN INDIA Context: India has emerged as the second-largest producer of crude steel globally, surpassing Japan and 2 nd largest consumer of finished steel.

GROUND-LEVEL OZONE Context: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has issued an alert on rising ozone pollution and multi-pollutant crisis in the national capital on World Environment Day 2023 (June 5). World Environment Day (WED): ● It is celebrated annually on 5 June and encourages awareness and action for the protection of the envi- ronment. ● It was established in 1972 by the UN at the Stock- holm Conference on the Human Environment. In 1973, the first WED was held with the theme “Only One Earth”. ● WED 2023 is hosted by Côte d›Ivoire in partnership with the Netherlands with the theme #BeatPlas- ticPollution. Ground-level ozone Meaning Also known as tropospheric ozone, it is a colourless and highly irritating gas that forms just above (up to 2 miles) the Earth’s surface. Classific a - tion It is a “secondary” pollutant (not directly emitted into the air). It is produced when two primary pollutants [nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] react in sunlight and stagnant air. How are NOx and VOCs formed? NOx and VOCs come from natural sources as well as human activities. About 95% of NOx comes from the burning of coal, gas- oline and oil in motor vehicles, etc. VOCs come mainly from gasoline production and combustion, residential wood com- bustion, etc. Harmful ef- fects On human health: As ground-level ozone is a highly reactive gas, it has serious health consequences. This can inflame and damage airways, make lungs susceptible to infection, and aggravate asthma, and chronic bronchitis leading to increased hospitalisation. On ecosystems: It can harm sensitive veg- etation and forests, parks and wildlife ref- uges. The situa- tion in India (2020 State of Global Air Report) Ozone is emerging as a serious public health issue in India (17%↑ between 2010 and 2017). Age-standardised rates of death attributable to ground-level ozone are among the highest in India. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 140 Highlights of the CSE analysis: ● Ground-level ozone usually exceeds the safety stan- dard (50 ppb over an 8-hour average) on all summer days in some locations in Delhi-NCR every year. ● Ground-level ozone, which should ideally become negligible in the night air, remains a problem at night too in the Delhi-NCR region. ● Even winter months (winter can inhibit the forma- tion of ground-level ozone) in Delhi-NCR face excess ozone levels, making it an all-year problem. VARUNASTRA Context: The Indian Navy and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) achieved a significant milestone as an indigenous heavy-weight torpedo, Varunastra, successfully engaged an underwater target in a live test.

It was 1st observed in 2019. The theme this year is “Food standards save lives” RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS Context: European regulators have approved the region’s first vac- cine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes thousands of hospitalisations and deaths annually. The shot, called Arexvy, is made by British drugmaker GSK and is designed to protect people aged 60 and over. Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respirato- ry virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. The virus was first dis- covered in 1956. •\t RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age The complex molecular structure of the virus and safety concerns with previous vaccine attempts was making diffi- cult the vaccine. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 142 GENETIC DIVERSITY Context: A study conducted by scientists from the CSIR-Centre for Cel- lular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) has revealed that genetic diversity decreases in species with larger body sizes and is higher in species where the mother cares for the offspring. •\t The study focused on centipedes and found that they have higher genetic diversity compared to oth- er arthropods like spiders and insects Other findings of the study: •\t Genetic diversity was found to be higher in the southern hemisphere: The findings suggest that historic climatic stability and low seasonality in southern latitudes may contribute to higher genetic diversity. •\t Genetic diversity increased with the geographical distance between individuals, indicating limited gene flow between distant sites. What is Genetic Diversity? Genetic diversity refers to the variation in genetic infor- mation within a population or species. It is a fundamental component of biodiversity and plays a critical role in the survival, adaptability, and sustainability of species and eco- systems. Explanation using an example: In a population of butterflies, genetic diversity refers to the presence of various genetic variations that determine traits like wing colour and patterns. This diversity allows butterflies to adapt to different environments. If a disease affects butterflies with a specific wing colour, low genet- ic diversity can lead to population decline. However, high genetic diversity enables some butterflies to be resistant to the disease, ensuring population survival and recovery. WATER CRISIS IN MEGHALAYA Context: Meghalaya is facing a severe water crisis, with a significant decline in rainfall and depleted water sources. Reasons for the water crisis: •\t A significant decrease in rainfall, climate change, deforestation, and unsustainable water manage- ment practices. •\t Meghalaya heavily relies on monsoons for its water supply, power, and agriculture. The decline in rain- fall has led to depleted water sources, particularly in urban areas. •\t Operational concerns within the Public Health En- gineering department, such as water losses and un- accounted-for water, also contribute to the crisis. •\t Insufficient rainfall has also caused a power crisis (using hydropower), with the main power source at risk of being shut down, further compounding the water crisis. Why meghalaya is called the ‘abode of clouds’? Meghalaya is called the ‘abode of clouds’ because it receives heavy rainfall throughout the year, leading to a cloudy and misty atmosphere. Geographical reason: Meghalaya receives rainfall throughout the year due to its geographical location and topography. The region is sur- rounded by hills and mountains. It is influenced by the southwest monsoon winds that bring moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The hilly terrain and dense forests of Meghalaya act as barriers, causing the moisture-laden clouds from the Southwest monsoon to rise and condense, resulting in con- tinuous rainfall. This geographical setup creates a unique microclimate in Meghalaya, making it one of the wettest places on Earth. About Mawsynram: Mawsynram, in Meghalaya, receives the highest rainfall in India. It is reportedly the wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of 11,872 millimetres. Mawsynram lies in the funnel-shaped depression caused by the Khasi range in Meghalaya. ATLANTIC DECLARATION Context: US and UK forged the ‘Atlantic Declaration’ with an aim to counter Russia, China and economic instability. “The Atlantic Declaration: A Framework for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership” outlines the com- mitment of the United States and the United Kingdom to Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 143 strengthen their economic alliance to address global chal- lenges. It emphasizes the need for cooperation in critical and emerg- ing technologies, economic security, digital transformation, clean energy, and defence.

TAURINE Context: A recent study has shown that Taurine - a nutrient found in meat, and fish and sold as a supplement - extends life and boosts health in a range of animal species. •\t Experiments on middle-aged animals showed boosting taurine to youthful levels extended life by over 10% and improved physical and brain health. About Taurine: •\t Taurine is an amino acid that has a few important roles in your body, including supporting immune health and nervous system function. •\t The scientific report suggests taurine plays a role in reducing cellular senescence - where cells in the body stop dividing - a hallmark of ageing. •\t The nutrient also appeared to keep mitochondria - the power stations in the body’s cells - functioning. •\t Taurine is virtually non-existent in plants. So, the nu- trient either comes from the animal protein in the diet or is manufactured by the body. CAPTAGON PILLS CRISIS Context: Reports suggest that the Islamic State (IS) and Syrian fight- ers widely consumed Captagon to increase alertness and suppress appetite during their gruelling battles. About Captagon: •\t Captagon is a highly addictive amphetamine-type drug, which is produced mainly in Syria and widely smuggled across West Asia. •\t Captagon is a counterfeit version of medicine with the same brand name that was originally produced in the 1960s to treat attention deficit disorders, narcolepsy, and other conditions. •\t The original Captagon contained fenetylline, a syn- thetic drug belonging to the phenethylamine family, including amphetamine. It was banned in the 1980s due to concerns about its addictive nature. •\t Amphetamine-based drugs like Captagon stimulate the central nervous system, providing a boost of energy, increased focus, and a feeling of euphoria. However, they do not confer superhuman abilities. •\t Side effects of these drugs can include loss of appe- tite, heart problems, high body temperature, mem- ory loss, and addiction. RED GIANT STAR BETELGEUSE Context: Recent research on the massive red giant star Betelgeuse suggests that it is in its late carbon-burning stage (near the end of its life) and may explode as a supernova within a few decades. Life Cycle of a Star: A star is born from a dense cloud of gas and dust called a nebula. Through the process of nuclear fusion, it converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy and emitting light. As the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it expands and becomes a red giant. In this phase, it fuses helium into heavier ele- ments like carbon and oxygen. While smaller stars, like our Sun, eventually shed their outer layers and form a white dwarf. Larger stars undergo a super- nova explosion, where their cores collapse and release an immense amount of energy. This explosion disperses heavy elements into space and may result in the formation of a neutron star or a black hole. What is a red giant star? A red giant star is a large, ageing star that has expanded and cooled down, causing it to appear red in colour. It occurs in the later stages of a star’s life cycle when it exhausts its hy- drogen fuel and starts burning heavier elements. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 145 About Betelgeuse It is a red giant star located in the constellation Orion. It is one of the largest and brightest stars visible to the naked eye. How have astronomers found the stage of Betelgeuse: Astronomers have suggested the stage of the red giant star Betelgeuse by studying its pulsations. Betelgeuse undergoes periodic expansion and contraction (similar to a boiling pot releasing steam), causing variations in its brightness. By ana- lysing these pulsations, researchers can infer the star’s cur- rent state. NASA’S PARKER SOLAR PROBE Context: NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has discovered that “coronal holes” in the sun’s atmosphere are the source of the fast so- lar wind, released during the rapid realignment of magnetic fields. Findings: •\t The probe revealed that coronal holes — darker, cooler regions that open in the sun’s outer atmo- sphere — are shaped like “showerheads” made up of mostly evenly spaced funnels of material. •\t Magnetic reconnection within funnel structures in coronal holes is responsible for generating the fast solar wind. Significance of finding: By tracking the solar wind back to its origin, scientists can now better predict solar storms that can impact Earth’s com- munication and power infrastructure. What is a Solar storm: A solar storm refers to a disturbance on the Sun that releas- es a large amount of energy in the form of solar flares, coro- nal mass ejections (CMEs), or high-speed solar winds. These events can cause disruptions in Earth’s magnetosphere, leading to geomagnetic storms that impact communication systems, power grids, and satellite operations. About Parker Solar Probe The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA spacecraft launched in 2018 to study the Sun up close.

DEFAULT LOSS GUARANTEE (DLG)/ FIRST LOSS DEFAULT GUARANTEE (FLDG) Context: The RBI has allowed a Default loss guarantee (DLG) (also called first Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG), a safety-net ar- rangement among banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and lending service providers (LSPs). www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 146 LSPs: These are new-age technology platforms/ agents (of a bank or NBFC) in the lending space who carry out one or more of a lender’s functions on behalf of regulated entities (REs). What is an FLDG arrangement? ● It is an arrangement whereby a third party such as a financial technology (fintech) player (LSP) compen- sates lenders if the borrower defaults. ● For all practical purposes, credit risk is borne by the LSP without having to maintain any regulatory cap- ital. Previous arrangement: ● RBI had expressed reservations about the FLDG arrangement because it felt that the model could pose a systemic risk. ● The RBI guidelines (2022) on digital lending did not provide clarity on the FLDG structure. New guidelines: ● The RBI permitted FLDG arrangements between banks and fintech or between two REs. ● The LSP-providing DLG must be incorporated as a company under the Companies Act, 2013. ● Banks and NBFCs should ensure that the total amount of DLG cover on any outstanding portfolio does not exceed 5% of the amount of that loan portfolio. Significance: This will facilitate the entry of small and medium fintech into the digital lending space in partnerships with banks or NBFCs. DIMETHYL ETHER FUELLED TRACTOR Context: Researchers at IIT Kanpur have developed India’s first 100% Dimethyl Ether (DME)-fuelled tractor/vehicle, marking a significant step towards a sustainable alternative fuel-based transport system.

How will e-RUPI benefit? ● It ensures an easy, contactless process that is oper- able on basic phones also. ● It will deepen the penetration of digital payments in the country and a major stride towards promoting financial inclusivity. SUPER-ENGINEERED VACCINES CREATED TO HELP END POLIO Context: Scientists have “super-engineered” polio vaccines to pre- vent them from mutating into a dangerous form that can cause outbreaks and paralysis. •\t The wild poliovirus is currently limited to small pockets in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and oral vac- cines play a crucial role in eradicating polio world- wide. •\t However, the oral vaccine has genetic instability, with just one mutation capable of reversing its safe- ty and causing paralysis. Vaccine-derived polio cas- es now outnumber wild poliovirus cases. What are Vaccine-derived polio cases: These are instances where the poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis in vaccinated individuals or spreads to others in the community. These cases occur when the weakened virus in the vaccine reverts to a form that can cause disease. To address this, researchers have genetically modified the weakened virus, making it more resistant to causing paraly- sis. The modified vaccines have shown promising results in human trials, providing more stability and addressing the instability concern (leading to Vaccine-derived polio cases. However, challenges remain in achieving full coverage and delivering vaccines to impoverished and conflict-affected areas. About Polio: Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is an infection caused by a virus (poliovirus). It is a serious, highly contagious dis- ease that can affect a person’s nervous system. There are three types of wild poliovirus: •\t WPV 1: still exists but efforts are going on to eradicate it. •\t WPV 2: eradicated. •\t WPV 3: eradicated. Polio typically affects children aged 5 years or younger. It can result in muscle weakness, permanent disability, and even death. LEPTOSPIROSIS Context: Leptospirosis is a dangerous infectious disease that has be- come significant worldwide, especially during monsoon season. •\t It is caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans and is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with the urine of infected animals. The disease is more prevalent in warm, humid countries and is often associated with heavy rainfall or flooding. Lep- tospirosis can range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe organ dysfunction, and it is estimated to affect around 1.03 million people annually, resulting in approximately 60,000 deaths. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 149 Leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed due to its symptoms resembling those of dengue, malaria, and hepatitis. Limit- ed access to reliable diagnostics, lack of awareness among physicians, and insufficient environmental surveillance fur- ther contribute to inaccurate reporting of cases. Prevention: •\t Preventing leptospirosis requires effective health education, community empowerment, and the adoption of preventive measures. Although com- monly referred to as “rat fever,” leptospirosis can be transmitted by various animals, and seasonal patterns and extreme weather events exacerbate its incidence. •\t Proper waste management, improved sanitation facilities, and control of stray animals is crucial in preventing the disease. ONE-SHOT CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE Context: According to the first phase 3 trial of the preventive pub- lished in The Lancet journal - a single-dose vaccine (VLA1553 vaccine) for chikungunya was found safe and produced a strong immune response against the viral disease. About Chikungunya: •\t The mosquito-borne disease is caused by the chi- kungunya virus (CHIKV), which is endemic in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. •\t Chikungunya causes symptoms such as fever, head- aches, fatigue, and severe muscle and joint pain and there are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments available.

TRADE RECEIVABLES DISCOUNTING SYS- TEM (TREDS) PLATFORMS Context: The Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are exploring the integration of the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) with the Trade Receivables Discounting Sys- tem (TReDS) platforms using an account aggregator. What is the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN)? The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a technology platform established by the Indian government to manage the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) sys- tem. It serves as a backbone for the GST regime, facilitating taxpayer registration, invoice filing, tax payment, and return filing processes. What are Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms? Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms are digital platforms that provide a mechanism for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to raise funds by selling their trade receivables or invoices to financiers at a discount- ed rate. These platforms facilitate the early realization of funds, helping SMEs improve their cash flow and working capital. What is an account aggregator? An account aggregator is a financial intermediary that col- lects and consolidates a user’s financial data from various sources such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Account Aggregator Network (AAN) is an RBI-regulated entity (with an NBFC-AA license) Currently, 23 banks from both public and private are under the AAN. AA framework was created in 2021 through an inter-regulatory decision by RBI and other regulators including SEBI, IRDA, and PFRDA through an initiative of the Financial Stability and Develop- ment Council (FSDC) How does the integration of GSTN with TReDS help? •\t It facilitates direct sanctions of invoices raised by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) on the GSTN platform. •\t By integrating the two systems, e-invoices generat- ed on the GSTN can be seamlessly transmitted to the TReDS portal, eliminating the need for addition- al activities or documentation. •\t This will lead to faster loan underwriting and sanc- tions as financiers will have greater confidence in the authenticity of the invoices sourced directly from the GST platform. •\t Development of an alternative credit database, par- ticularly benefiting MSMEs with limited credit histo- ry. GLOBAL FUND FOR RECYCLING LITHI- UM-ION BATTERIES Context: A policy brief for the G20 suggests establishing a global fund to invest in increasing recycling capacities for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). Need: •\t There is a rising demand for minerals like Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, and Graphite. •\t Existing battery waste materials have significant po- tential and can generate a value of around $4,800- 5,200 per tonne. •\t Safe and environmentally beneficial recycling •\t Battery recycling is at a nascent stage with gaps concerning technology in reducing recycling costs and improving material recovery capacity. Lithium-ion battery recycling technologies: Technologies Description Me c hanic al Separation This technology involves the physical separation of lithium-ion battery com- ponents through mechanical processes such as shredding and sieving. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 153 Pyrometallur- gical Process It is a high-temperature process that uses heat to melt and separate battery components, recovering valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, etc. Hydrom e tal - lurgical Pro- cess In this process, lithium-ion batteries are dissolved in a liquid solution, and chem- ical reactions are used to separate and recover valuable metals. Lithium Recov- ery from Elec- trolyte This specific process targets the recovery of lithium from the electrolyte of lithi- um-ion batteries, which can then be re- used or processed further. Biological Pro- cess This emerging technology involves the use of biological agents or microorgan- isms to extract and recover valuable ma- terials from lithium-ion batteries. India’s steps: •\t Battery waste management Act 2022 confers the Producers (including importers) the obligation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for the bat- tery that they introduce in the market to ensure its collection and recycling. LAB-GROWN HUMAN EMBRYO MODELS Context: Recently, scientists have successfully created advanced em- bryo-like structures using human stem cells. These synthetic embryos develop similarly to natural embryos at around 14 days after fertilization. •\t This breakthrough allows researchers unprecedent- ed opportunities to study human embryonic devel- opment at later stages. However, it also raises ethi- cal and legal questions regarding the regulation and status of these “embryo models.” •\t The ability to study embryo models beyond 14 days is significant because it allows researchers to ex- plore developmental defects and pregnancy loss, which are challenging to study using animal mod- els. Controversy: •\t The scientific controversy surrounding this research arises from the highly competitive race to develop embryo models at later stages. •\t Ethical concerns have also emerged regarding the status and regulation of human embryo models. While these models are not subject to the 14-day rule applied to natural embryos, guidelines and reg- ulations related to the use of human embryonic stem cells must be followed. 31 MQ-9B ARMED DRONES Context: India’s defence ministry has approved the purchase of 31 MQ-9B armed drones from the US. •\t The drones, with an endurance of over 27 hours and an operating capability of up to 50,000 feet, will strengthen India’s defence capabilities. •\t The acquisition comes after increased tensions with China and will enhance India’s surveillance capabil- ities. About MQ-9 drones: •\t The hunter-killer MQ-9 drones are capable of a va- riety of roles, including maritime surveillance, an- ti-submarine warfare, over-the-horizon targeting, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare. •\t The Sky Guardian variant has a wingspan of 79 feet and can carry a payload of 2,155kg on nine hard- points. •\t The Sea Guardian variant can fly over the horizon via satellite for more than 30 hours and has advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION ALTERS EARTH’S ROTATION Context: A recent study published in the journal Geophysical Re- search Letters reveals that extensive groundwater extraction by humans has had a significant effect on Earth’s rotation. Findings: Between 1993 and 2010, the excessive pumping of groundwater caused the planet’s rotational pole to shift eastward by approximately 80 centimetres. The research indicates that humans extracted around 2,150 gigatons of groundwater during this period, equivalent to over 6 milli- metres of sea-level rise. How groundwater extraction influences Earth’s rotation? When we take a lot of water out from underground (ground- water extraction), it changes how the Earth spins (called ‘po- lar drift’). Imagine spinning a top and then adding or removing weight from one side. The top will wobble or spin differently. Simi- larly, when we extract groundwater, it shifts the weight dis- tribution on Earth’s surface, causing a slight change in its ro- tation. This can move the Earth’s axis (the imaginary line it spins around) a little bit. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 154 Impact: While it does not affect our daily lives much, sci- entists study these changes because they can impact the Earth’s climate over long periods of time. Other factors: Melting of glaciers -Climate change has caused billions of tonnes of glacial ice to melt into oceans. This has caused the Earth’s poles to move in new directions. SYNTHETIC HYDROCARBON FUEL Context: Germany has proposed transitioning to carbon-neutral syn- thetic fuels for existing internal combustion vehicles instead of phasing them out completely. Reasons for such a proposal: •\t Even though electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells have zero-emission during usage, their manu- facturing processes have significant environmental impacts. •\t Approximately 90% of the world’s vehicles are ex- pected to be internal combustion by 2030, and re- placing them entirely would not be a zero-carbon solution. Synthetic Hydrocarbon Fuel About Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel is a type of fuel that is artificially created through chemical processes using carbon-based feedstocks. Production Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel is produced by combining carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the atmosphere with hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is typically sourced through direct air capture or other meth- ods, while the hydrogen can be generated using renewable energy sources like the electrolysis of water. Benefits Producing synthetic fuel could be car- bon-negative if the carbon emissions from the fuel are less than the carbon cap- tured during the production process. Even if there is a net carbon release, it may still be lower than the carbon impact of man- ufacturing a large number of electric vehi- cles (EVs). Challenges High initial cost compared to petrol or die- sel; engineering hurdles inefficient carbon capture; need for advancements in green hydrogen electrolysis GEMINID METEORS Context: Researchers demystify the unusual origin of the Geminids meteor shower. •\t NASA’s Parker Solar Probe mission is providing new evidence that a violent, catastrophic event created the Geminids. Findings: •\t While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids are believed to come from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. Unlike comets, asteroids like Phaethon are not typically affected by the Sun’s heat. •\t By analysing the data collected by the Parker Solar Probe, the scientists modelled three possible sce- narios for the formation of the Geminid stream and compared them to existing models based on Earth-based observations. •\t They concluded that violent scenarios, such as high- speed collisions or gaseous explosions, were the most consistent with the Parker data. This suggests that a sudden and powerful event likely triggered the creation of the Geminid meteor stream from Phaethon.

Previ- ously, Supreme Court ruled that CIL cannot be exempted from the Competition Act, emphasizing the need for fair competition and non-discrimination. The judgment re- affirms the principle of competitive neutrality, applying antitrust laws equally to public and private sector enter- prises. MINIMUM DIETARY DIVERSITY (MDD) Context: Inadequate dietary diversity and meal frequency contribute to child malnutrition in India, including stunting and micro- nutrient deficiencies. What is Minimum Dietary Diversity? Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) refers to a recommend- ed standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children aged 6-23 months. It suggests that during the previous day or within 24 hours, children should consume foods and beverages from at least five of the eight defined food groups. Aim of the MDD: It aims to ensure that children receive a diverse range of nutrients to meet their nutritional needs and promote their healthy growth and development. Status of MDD: India has a significantly low proportion of children (15 per cent) who meet MDD, followed by Nepal (34 per cent), which suggests that South Asian countries are trailing behind in terms of MDD Need of MDD: Poor-quality diets during the first two years of life can have long-lasting effects on a child’s health and development. In- dia has high rates of child malnutrition, with a low propor- tion of children meeting the MDD. About WHO initiative: WHO has developed guidelines for Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, with MDD being one of the core indicators. The eight food groups used for the tabulation of this indicator are: 1. Breast milk 2. Grains products 3. Vegetables such as roots, tubers, plantains 4. Pulses (beans, peas, lentils) 5. Nuts, seeds 6. Dairy products (milk, infant formula, yoghurt, cheese) 7. Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats), eggs 8. Vitamin-A-rich fruits and vegetables Suggestions: Breast milk alone is not sufficient after 6-8 months, and complementary solid or semi-solid foods are necessary. Socioeconomic factors and maternal education play a sig- nificant role in MDD inequalities. National programs like the POSHAN Abhiyaan need to be strengthened further. Relying solely on supplements and fortification may not be enough.

Challenges: •\t Achieving consumer acceptance, reducing costs, and ensuring the availability of high-quality cells and resources for production. NILOTINIB Context: The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) has signed sub-licence agreements with some Indian companies, as well as an Indo- nesian firm to produce generic versions of the cancer drug Nilotinib. •\t Nilotinib, used for treating chronic myeloid leukae- mia, is currently marketed by Novartis under the brand name Tasigna. About Medicines Patent Pool: The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) is a United Nations-backed public health organisation working to increase access to and facilitate the development of, life-saving medicines for low- and middle-income countries. Significance of the move: •\t This move is expected to make cancer treatment more affordable and accessible to patients in low- and middle-income countries, providing a much-needed treatment option for those diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. CHIRAL BOSE-LIQUID STATE Context: Recent research suggests that the chiral Bose-liquid state could be a completely new form of matter. •\t Typically, matter exists in solid, liquid, or gas states. However, at extremely low temperatures or within the quantum realm, matter behaves differently. About Quantum states of matter: •\t Quantum states of matter exhibit unique behaviours distinct from our familiar solid, liquid, and gaseous states. •\t Frustrated quantum systems, in particular, involve the interactions of particles leading to infinite pos- sibilities. In these systems, collisions can produce unexpected outcomes, such as levitating or defying traditional angles. How it was formed: The chiral bose-liquid state is formed by bringing two layers of a special material very close together at very low tem- peratures (close to absolute Zero). One layer has an abun- dance of electrons, while the other layer has “holes” where electrons can go. When these layers are brought together, a local imbalance is created, causing electrons to not have enough holes to fill. This imbalance triggers the formation of the chiral bose-liquid state, which has unique properties and behaviours. This unique state allows electrons to freeze into predictable patterns, exhibit resilience to changes in spin (a character- istic of subatomic particles), and synchronize their move- ments. Why it is called ‘Chiral’? The term “chiral” refers to a property in physics where an object or system cannot be superimposed onto its mirror im- age. In the context of the chiral bose-liquid state, the term “chiral” is used because the electrons in the chiral bose-liq- uid state move or behave differently compared to their mir- ror-image counterparts, leading to unique and asymmetric characteristics. Application: The state could be useful for encryption technology in the future. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 164 CORD BLOOD BANKING Context: Recently, many actresses have chosen to preserve their ba- by’s cord blood. About Cord Blood: •\t Cord blood is a rich source of stem cells that can po- tentially be used in the treatment of certain blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. •\t Private stem cell banking companies offer commu- nity or social banking options where stored cord blood is accessible to registered individuals. •\t These community banks have a larger pool of do- nors, increasing the chances of finding a match for patients in need. The use of cord blood in transplants has declined in re- cent years, with haploidentical transplants (It uses healthy, blood-forming cells from a half-matched family member do- nor to replace the unhealthy ones) becoming more common and successful. While emerging technologies may improve the utilization of cord blood in the future, the present trend shows the under-utilization of stored cord blood.

Context: Astrophysicists are studying the origins and nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), powerful radio frequency emissions from distant galaxies, which last only milliseconds. •\t Recent findings suggest that FRBs may be triggered by the collision of two neutron stars just before they merge. This collision releases gravitational waves and FRBs, which can be detected and stud- ied. What are Fast radio bursts (FRBs)? Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief and intense bursts of radio waves originating from deep space. They are highly energet- ic and last for only a few milliseconds. Significance: The study sheds light on the intense radio light observed in the host galaxies of some FRBs. These findings have impli- cations for gravitational-wave astronomy and suggest that future radio telescopes, in combination with gravitation- al-wave observatories like the Square Kilometre Array and the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), could provide further insights into these high-energy cos- mic events and the structure of the universe. What are Radio waves and their significance in astronomy? Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with long wavelengths and low frequencies. In astronomy, radio waves play a significant role in studying celestial objects and phenomena. They allow astronomers to observe objects that are not visible in other wavelengths of light, such as gal- axies, pulsars, quasars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. PLANT LITERACY FOR CURBING CLIMATE CHANGE Context: Craig Brodersen, a professor of plant physiological ecology at Yale University, has highlighted how human-induced condi- tions like drought impact plant species and emphasizes the need for ‘Plant Literacy’ to understand plants’ physiological responses for resilience in farming. What is plant literacy? Plant literacy refers to the understanding and knowledge about plants, including their structure, functions, adapta- tions, and ecological importance. It involves being aware of the role plants play in various ecosystems, their interactions with the environment, and their significance for human sur- vival. How Plants Help Humans: Benefits of Plants Description Oxygen Produc- tion Plants are the primary producers of ox- ygen through photosynthesis, provid- ing the oxygen necessary for humans and other organisms to breathe. Food Source Plants serve as a vital source of food, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and herbs, providing essential nutrients and sustenance for human consump- tion and survival. Water Manage- ment Plants play a crucial role in managing Earth’s water cycle, controlling 60% of the flow of water between land and the atmosphere. They help regulate precipitation patterns and prevent soil erosion. Climate Regula- tion Through photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, mitigating the greenhouse effect and stabilizing glob- al climate patterns. Biodiversity Sup- port Plants provide habitats and food sourc- es for a diverse range of organisms, supporting biodiversity and contribut- ing to the overall health and balance of ecosystems. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 166 MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY (MLAT) Context: United States government has decided to return more than 100 Indian antiquities (such as Shiva, Parvathi, and Nataraja, originating from the Chola-era temples in Tamil Nadu) under MLAT. What is MLAT? MLAT stands for Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. It is a for- mal agreement between two or more countries that allows them to cooperate and aid each other in criminal matters. •\t It allows for mutual assistance on antiquities repa- triation. Nodal Ministry: Ministry of Home Affairs is a nodal ministry for executing court orders under MLATs. Legal Act: Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (AATA), 1972 makes the ex- port of antiquities without a licence, from the Archaeologi- cal Survey of India, a criminal offence. •\t Also, Customs Act 1962 prevents the export of an- tiquities. GREEDFLATION Context: The article explores the concept of “greedflation” and dis- cusses whether India is experiencing it. What is Greedflation? It refers to a situation where corporate greed fuels inflation. Instead of the traditional wage-price spiral, it is the prof- it-price spiral that drives inflation. In developed countries like Europe and the US, there is a growing consensus that greedflation is a significant factor contributing to inflation. Types of Greedflation: Scenario Description Greedflation Energy Com- panies and Fuel Prices During a crisis or sud- den surge in energy demand, such as a nat- ural disaster or geopo- litical event, energy companies may raise fuel prices dispropor- tionately. Energy compa- nies exploit the situation by im- posing exces- sive price hikes, leading to higher inflationary pres- sures for consum- ers. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 167 Essen t i a l Commodities during a Cri- sis In times of scarcity or crisis, certain essential commodities like food, water, or medical sup- plies may experience a surge in demand Sellers of essen- tial commodities increase prices excessively, ex- ploiting consum- ers and contrib- uting to higher inflation during crises. Price Mark- ups and Prof- it Margins Companies may in- crease profit margins by keeping market prices high even when input costs decrease. For example, if raw materi- al costs decline, companies may maintain product prices without passing on sav- ings to consum- ers. This allows companies to generate higher profits and con- tributes to infla- tionary pressures. India’s Case: In the context of India, the profitability of Indian companies has nearly tripled compared to the period before the pan- demic. A significant growth in net profit, primarily driven by an increase in profit margins, indicates a possibility of cor- porate greed contributing to inflation in India. Impact of Greedflation: It leads to higher inflationary pressures, financial strain on individuals, and reduced purchasing power. It undermines trust in businesses, distorts market dynamics, and hampers economic stability and growth. SOLAR MEAN MAGNETIC FIELD Context: Scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) have made progress in identifying the source of the Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF), which influences interplan- etary magnetic space and plays a significant role in space weather. What is Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF)? The Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF) refers to the aver- age strength and direction of the magnetic field on the sur- face of the Sun. Findings: •\t The researchers found a strong similarity between the SMMF at chromospheric heights and the SMMF at photospheric heights, suggesting that the sun’s primordial magnetic field could be the source of the SMMF. •\t Understanding the source and driving parameters of the SMMF could enhance our understanding of how it affects the IMF and space weather. Application of SMMF: The Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF) has various appli- cations in the field of space weather. For example, by study- ing the SMMF, scientists can better predict and understand phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These events can have a significant impact on Earth’s mag- netic field, leading to geomagnetic storms and disruptions in satellite communication and power grids. NEW CSR GUIDELINES ‘SAGAR SAMAJIK SAHAYOG’ Context: The Union Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways and Ayush has launched the new guidelines for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) called ‘Sagar Samajik Sahayyog’. About the guidelines: •\t The guidelines empower ports to directly under- take CSR activities. •\t Ports with a turnover less than ₹100 crores should spend 3-5%, those with a turnover less than ₹500 crores should spend 2-3%, and ports with a turnover more than ₹500 crores should spend 0.5-2% on CSR initiatives. •\t Priority Areas: Allocating a portion of CSR funds for Sainik Kalyan Board, National Maritime Heritage Complex, National Youth Development Fund, and various social and environmental welfare programs.

What is Greenwashing? Greenwashing refers to the deceptive practice of portraying a company, product, or initiative as environmentally friendly or sustainable when it actually lacks substantial environmen- tal benefits or may even be environmentally harmful. For example, a clothing brand may advertise its products as “eco-friendly” or “green” while still using unsustainable manufacturing processes, contributing to pollution, or ex- ploiting labour. About the global norms for combating Greenwashing: International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), will set uniform sustainability and climate standards for companies to follow worldwide from 2024. New standards are: •\t IFRS S1: sets out disclosure requirements designed to enable companies to communicate to investors about the sustainability-related risks and opportu- nities they face. •\t IFRS S2: sets out specific climate-related disclosures and is designed to be used with IFRS S1. These norms, published by the ISSB with the support of the G20, are intended to assist regulators in cracking down on misleading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) claims. •\t These are non-binding and it is up to individual countries to determine whether listed companies must adhere to these standards. •\t It builds upon voluntary guidelines from the G20’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which have already been made mandatory for listed companies in Britain. Financial Stability Board (FSB) created TCFD to improve reporting of climate-related financial information. FSB is an international body (India is a member) that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. About ISSB The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is a standard-setting body established in 2021–2022 under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation (a non-profit organisation governing interna- tional accounting rules) The mandate of ISSB: Its mandate is the creation and de- velopment of sustainability-related financial reporting stan- dards to meet investors’ needs for sustainability reporting.

The NANDI portal will expedite and strengthen the regulatory process by enabling coordination between government depart- ments, institutes, and industry stakeholders. •\t The launch of NANDI aligns with the Animal Pan- demic Preparedness Initiative (APPI) and the Digital India vision. •\t The portal is to be streamlined with CDSCOs SUGAM portal (it builds a comprehensive database of the various permissions and licenses issued by State FDAs) PROKARYOTES AND EUKARYOTES Context: The article talks about how more complex organisms called eukaryotes evolved from simpler organisms called prokary- otes. The Evolution: Long ago, there were simple organisms called prokaryotes. They were single-celled and didn’t have a nucleus. But over time, some of these organisms evolved to have mitochon- dria and DNA packaged into a nucleus. The mitochondria, which produce energy in eukaryotic cells, and chloroplasts in plant cells, originally came from free-liv- ing bacteria. This happened when an ancient Archaea or- ganism engulfed a bacterium, and over time, they formed a mutually beneficial relationship. This event eventually led to the development of animals, fungi, and plants. This evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes happened gradually and involved various changes in their structure and functions. Main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes: Prokaryotes Eukaryotes Nucleus Absent Present DNA Circular Linear Mem - brane-bound organelles Absent Present (e.g., mito- chondria, chloro- plasts) Size Smaller Larger Reproduction Asexual (mostly)Sexual and asexual Examples Bacteria and Ar- chaea Plants, animals, fungi, protists 2023 GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX Context: India has been ranked 40th on the latest world competi- tiveness ranking released by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). •\t Although India has slipped three spots from the previous year, it has improved from its 43rd rank in 2019-2021. The highlight of the Report: •\t There is progress in government efficiency but points out weaknesses in business efficiency, infra- structure, and economic performance. •\t The top three spots in the ranking were claimed by Denmark, Ireland, and Switzerland. Measures helping India: •\t The three main measures that helped India in its score are exchange rate stability, compensation lev- els, and improvements in pollution control. Challenges for India: •\t Sustaining high GDP growth, managing financial market volatility, controlling inflation and fiscal defi- cit, accelerating digital transformation, and mobiliz- ing resources for infrastructure development.

Introduction of Sul- phur coated Urea (Urea Gold) To address the sulphur defi- ciency of soil and save input costs for the farmers. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PMKSKs) For the convenience of farm- ers, farm inputs are being pro- vided as a one-stop solution for all needs of farmers. About one lakh PMKSKs have already come up in the country. Significance: ● The approved schemes will help in the judicious use of chemical fertilisers, thereby reducing the input cost of cultivation for the farmers. ● The initiatives will boost farmers’ income, strength- en natural/organic farming, rejuvenate soil produc- tivity, and ensure food security. Current Affairs 30 www.insightsonindia.com 173 SHORT-LIVED HALOGENS Context: A new study reveals that oceans play a crucial role in cooling the planet by releasing short-lived halogens, including chlo- rine, bromine, and iodine. •\t These halogens currently contribute 8-10% of cool- ing, a figure projected to increase to 18-31% by 2100. About Short-lived halogens: Short-lived halogens refer to chlorine, bromine, and iodine compounds that have a relatively short lifespan in the at- mosphere, typically less than six months. These halogens play a role in the Earth’s climate system by contributing to cooling and warming effects. ASPARTAME Context: The cancer research arm of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), is reportedly set to list the artificial sweetener as- partame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” •\t If confirmed, would go against previous studies that have found no evidence of harm caused by aspar- tame. About Aspartame: •\t Aspartame is widely used as a sugar substitute in various food and beverage products, including diet soft drinks, chewing gum, and breakfast cereals etc. The IARC’s assessment does not take into account safe con- sumption levels, which are determined by the Joint Orga- nization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and national regulators. Other examples of artificial sweeteners are: Sucralose, Sac- charin, Stevia, Neotame RESPONSIBLE ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION CERTIFICATE Context: A new certification scheme has been launched in India to promote responsible antibiotic manufacturing (first of its kind) About the Scheme: •\t Developed by: the British Standards Institute (BSI) (a business improvement and standards company) and the AMR Industry Alliance (one of the largest private sector coalitions that provide long-term solutions to antimicrobial resistance) •\t Aim: To address environmental concerns related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by limiting the re- lease of antibiotic residues into waterways through industrial waste. •\t Process: o The certification process involves third-par- ty validation to monitor environmental practices throughout the manufacturing process. o Manufacturers must demonstrate effective environmental management and wastewa- ter treatment systems to obtain certifica- tion. o The concentration of antibiotics in waste streams must be below a specified thresh- old to prevent the emergence of AMR in the environment. •\t Time: The certification is valid for three years, with annual surveillance to ensure ongoing compliance. In 2022, The AMR Industry Alliance and BSI came up with a set of Antibiotic Manufacturing Standards and launched the certification to ensure their implementation. The initiative is part of efforts to promote sustainable and responsible drug production while mitigating the environmental impact of antibiotic manufacturing. American bald eagle Context: The American bald eagle was removed from the endangered species list in 2007, marking a significant mile- stone in its conservation. www.insightsonindia.com Current Affairs 30 174 •\t The bird’s population has steadily increased since then, with a 2021 report stating that the number of bald eagles in the wild has quadrupled since 2009. •\t The bald eagle, once abundant across the United States with an estimated 100,000 nesting birds in the country, faced a severe decline in population due to hunting, habitat destruction, and the pes- ticide DDT. However, measures such as the ban on DDT and the implementation of the Endangered Species Act helped protect the species and prevent it from going extinct. About the Am e r ic an bald eagle Habitat The bald eagle’s natural range covers most of North America, including most of Cana- da, all of the continental US, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Characteris- tics The average life span of bald eagles is 20 to 30 years. Bald eagles build their nests at the very top of tall trees so the eggs will be safe. Female bald eagles are a bit bigger than the males. Feeding Pat- tern Besides live fish, bald eagles also prey on other birds, small mammals, snakes, tur- tles, and crabs, and they readily eat carrion (decaying flesh of dead animals). Pr o t ect i o n Status IUCN Status: Least Concern SEA LIONS AND ALGAE BLOOM Context: A recent outbreak of algae bloom - commonly known as red tide - has sickened and killed an unknown number of sea li- ons and dolphins off the coast of California, US. Sea lions (IUCN Status - Endangered): ● They are pinnipeds characterised by external ear flaps, long fore flippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair and a big chest and belly. ● Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, except the northern Atlantic Ocean. Algal bloom/red tides: ● An algal bloom is a term used for the excessive growth of algae over a water body causing disco- louration of the water body. ○ Blooms can proliferate because of human causes such as climate change and an ex- cess of nitrates washed out to sea. ● Red tide is the red colouration of seawater due to the presence of dinoflagellate Gonyaulax. Impact: ● Algal blooms cause the production of a neurotoxin called domoic acid and result in the death of fish and other aquatic organisms. ● Small fish consume the toxin and pass it up the food chain. Humans are unaffected unless they eat infect- ed shellfish. HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT (HQA) BE- TWEEN INDIA AND CDRI Context: The Union Cabinet has given its approval for ratification of the Headquarters Agreement (HQA) between the Govern- ment of India (Gol) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).

The report highlighted India’s achievements in reducing energy and carbon intensity, achieving universal energy ac- cess, and managing electricity affordability. India also fared relatively well during the recent energy crisis due to a low share of natural gas in power generation and increased use of existing capacities. •\t Singapore was the only other major economy showing momentum in sustainability, energy secu- rity, and equity. GRAVITATIONAL VIBRATIONS Context: Scientists have found evidence suggesting the presence of a continuous background of gravitational waves in the uni- verse. About Gravitational Waves: •\t Gravitational waves are disturbances in the fabric of spacetime caused by the movement of large ob- jects, such as the collision of two black holes. •\t The waves were first detected in 2015, but this new research indicates that multiple gravitational waves constantly deform and reshape spacetime, influ- encing the motion of celestial bodies. Findings: Scientists have discovered a ‘background hum’ rumbling throughout the universe. It confirms the presence of low-frequency (long-wavelengths) gravitational waves, thought to be constantly rolling through space noise. India’s Giant Metre wave Radio Telescope (GMRT, Pune) was among the world’s six large telescopes that played a vital role in providing evidence. The other 5 are located in Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.

How vulnerable India is? ● Globally, India has the largest density of tribal pop- ulation [Census 2011: Tribal population - 8.6% of the total population of India/ 67.8 million]. ● Sickle cell disease is one of the 10 special problems in tribal health that affect the tribal people dispro- portionately, thus making intervention necessary. National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission: ● Mission: To improve the care of all Sickle Cell Dis- ease patients for their better future and to lower the prevalence of the disease through a multi-faced co- ordinated approach towards screening and aware- ness strategies. ● Vision: Eliminate sickle cell disease as a public health problem in India by 2047. DIVERSITY FOR RESTORATION (D4R) TOOL Context: Researchers have developed a tool called Diversity for Res- toration (D4R) to aid in agroforestry and ecosystem resto- ration efforts. •\t The tool, initially created by Bioversity International and later adopted by a team from Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) for the Indian context, aims to enhance the effec- tiveness of restoration programs while promoting sustainable development. The online tool helps stakeholders identify suitable tree species for restoration objectives based on their ecological benefits and resistance to local stresses. The tool is already being used in various countries and offers recommendations for maximizing restoration success along with propagation information and monitoring suggestions. It is seen as a comprehensive tool for socio-ecologically re- sponsible restoration. SPORTS CORNER SQUASH WORLD CUP Context: Squash is a fast-paced racquet sport played by two players (singles) or four players (doubles) on a four- walled court. The objective is to hit a small rubber ball against the front wall, making it difficult for the opponent to return. The Squash World Cup, set to take place in Chennai, from June 13 to 17, is introducing some exciting changes to at- tract attention and engage more people in the sport. Changes introduced: The tournament will feature a mixed team competition and will be played in the format of a best-of-five game, with each game played to seven points instead of the usual 11. In case of a tie, the winning team will be deter- mined by the greater positive difference between games won and lost. The players believe the new format will bring a more aggressive and thrilling style of play to the tournament. WORLD TEST CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL Context: Australia convincingly defeated India by 209 runs in the World Test Championship final held at The Oval. With this victory, Australia became the second team, af- ter New Zealand, to win the prestigious Mace. This marks India’s second consecutive loss in the WTC final.
