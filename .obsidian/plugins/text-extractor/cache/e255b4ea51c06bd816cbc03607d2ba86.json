The Opium Wars: The wars were a result of Britain’s increasing consumption of tea, which led to a trade deficit with China. To address this, the British East India Company promoted the opium trade, leading to a significant increase in opium production in India for export to China. As opium addiction spread in China, it caused severe so- cio-economic crises and weakened the Qing dynasty’s gov- ernance. The Chinese attempts to crack down on opium smuggling resulted in conflict with the British, leading to two Opium Wars.

The emphasis on opium also had adverse effects on India’s trade and led to a distortion of the Indian economy. •\t Social Consequences: The increased cultivation and trade of opium contributed to the addiction and widespread use of opium within certain regions of India, leading to social problems and health issues. •\t British Control: As Britain emerged victorious in the Opium wars, it further solidified British control over its colonies, including India. •\t Shift in British Policies: The revenue generated from the opium trade played a significant role in financ- ing British colonial activities in India, including the maintenance of their military and administrative apparatus. Charter Act Regulations: •\t Charter Act of 1813: The Act granted a monopoly of the opium trade to the British East India Company, allowing the Company to control and regulate the opium business in India. •\t Charter Act of 1833: The Company continued to maintain its monopoly on the production and sale of opium in India, particularly for export to China. •\t Charter Act of 1853: It did not address the opium trade directly. The British East India Company still retained control over opium cultivation and trade in India during this period. Amitav Ghosh’s argument: Opium played a central role in sustaining colonialism in Asia, bringing immense profits to colonial powers at the ex- pense of Indian labour and the well-being of the Chinese population. The book suggests that opium, with its addictive properties, has had a profound impact on societies across classes and continues to shape history. Mains Links: Q. 1. At the beginning of the 20th century, Chinese nation- alism took a more definite shape and centred primarily on two issues – anti-Manchuism and anti-imperialism which be- came the primary causes of the revolution.

(250 words) GS Paper 2/ 3 THE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2021 Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation/ Environment and Conservation Context: The Lok Sabha passed the contentious Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill 2021. Background: ● Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms that exist on the planet. ● Human activities have created challenges for biodi- versity such as loss of habitat, and deterioration of ecological systems, and there have also been con- cerns around bio-piracy. ○ Bio-piracy involves the unauthorised appro- priation of biological resources and related knowledge belonging to indigenous com- munities. ● A key multilateral treaty to address these concerns is the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 1992. India became a signatory to CBD in 1994. ○ The CBD recognises sovereign rights over bi- ological resources. ○ It permits countries to regulate access to these resources as per their national legis- lation. ○ It recognises the contributions of local communities to conservation and sustain- able use through traditional knowledge. ○ It provides for equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilisation of these resourc- www.insightsonindia.com4 es with such people. ● In light of India’s commitments under CBD, the Bio- logical Diversity Act 2002 was passed by Parliament. About the Biological Diversity Act 2002: ● It regulates access to biological resources and as- sociated traditional knowledge. It specifies distinct frameworks for regulating access by foreign and do- mestic entities. ● It sets up a 3-tier structure for regulation: ○ National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the national level, ○ State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs) at the state level, and ○ Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at the local body level. ● The Act provides for sharing of benefits (through monetary compensation, sharing of IPRs or tech- nology transfer) with conservers of biodiversity and holders and creators of associated knowledge. Salient provi- sions The Biological Diver- sity Act 2002 The Biologi- cal Diversity (Amendment) Bill 2021 Access to bi- ological re- sources and associa t ed knowledge Requires prior ap- proval or intimation to the regulatory au- thority based on the origin of the entity Amends the clas- sification of en- tities, list of ac- tivities requiring intimation, and adds exemptions Approval for In t e lle c tu - al Property Rights (IPR) Approval of NBA is re- quired before apply- ing for IPR involving biological resources obtained from India or sealing of the pat- ent Approval will be required before the grant of IPR instead of before the application itself Benefit shar- ing NBA is required to determine terms of benefit sharing while granting approvals for various activities SBB will deter- mine benefit sharing while granting approv- als to domestic entities as per the regulations by NBA Offences and Penalties Offences include fail- ing to take approval or providing prior in- timation for various activities. These of- fences are punishable with imprisonment of up to five years/ a fine/ both The Bill decrim- inalises the of- fences and makes offences punish- able with a pen- alty between one lakh rupees and Rs 50 lakh Access to bio- logical resourc- es and associat- ed knowledge The Biological Di- versity Act, 2002 Changes made by the Bill Approval re- quired from NBA (for cer- tain foreign en- tities) Entities: foreign individuals, NRIs, companies not registered in India, and companies registered in India and having non-In- dian participation in share capital or management Entities: changes the last category to companies regis- tered in India which are “foreign-con- trolled” companies as under the Com- panies Act, 2013 Prior intima- tion required to SBB (for cer- tain domestic entities) Activities: obtain- ing biological re- sources occurring in India for com- mercial utilisation Activities: access to associated knowl- edge for commer- cial utilisation will also require prior intimation Exemptions: use by local people and communities including growers and cultivators of biodiversity Exemptions: adds exemptions for codified tradition- al knowledge, cul- tivated medicinal plants and their products, AYUSH practitioners Significance of the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill 2021: The Bill seeks to amend the 2002 Act to: ● Simplify compliance requirements for domestic companies. ● Encourage the Indian system of medicine and culti- vation of wild medicinal plants, ● Facilitate fast-tracking of processes for research, pat- ent application, and transfer of research results, ● Decriminalise offences, and ● Encourage foreign investment in the sector. Key issues: ● The term codified traditional knowledge has not been defined. A broad interpretation might exempt all local traditional knowledge from benefit-sharing requirements. ● The Bill removes the direct role of local communi- ties in determining benefit-sharing provisions. ● The Bill decriminalises offences under the Act and instead provides for a wide range of penalties. ● The Bill confers discretion to government officials, as they can hold inquiries and determine penalties. ● A review of the law was necessary, however, the present bill can appear to be limited and selective, especially to favour specific bio resources-based in- dustries. www.insightsonindia.com5 Way ahead: The Joint Parliamentary Committee (to which the Bill was referred) recommended that the penalty struc- ture (should not be too meagre) should be proportionate to the gains obtained by entities using biological resources. Content for Mains Enrichment UNESCO ENDORSES BANNING SMARTPHONES FROM SCHOOLS Context: UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report 2023 warns against the uncritical adoption of digital tech- nology in educational settings, as there is little robust evi- dence of its added value in education. Negative impact of mobile devices on children’s learning: Negative Impact Examples Distraction Students get distracted during lectures or study time due to notifications from social media apps. Reduced Atten- tion Span Children find it difficult to focus on a single task for an extended period due to constant multitasking on devices. Decreased Read- ing Habit Children spend more time on mobile games and videos than reading books or educational material. Impaired Sleep Excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime leads to sleep disturbances and reduced sleep duration. Cyberbullying Children experiencing cyberbullying through social media platforms, lead to emotional distress and impact their learning. Reduced Face-to- Face Interaction Overreliance on virtual communica- tion leads to decreased social skills and communication abilities. Lack of Physical Activity Spending excessive time on mobile devices leads to a sedentary lifestyle, affecting overall health and academic performance. Inaccurate Infor- mation Children may come across misleading or false information online, impacting their understanding and knowledge. Privacy Concerns Sharing personal information on social media or other platforms without un- derstanding the potential risks to pri- vacy. Addiction Developing addictive behaviour to- wards mobile devices leads to with- drawal symptoms when not using them. Recommendations: •\t The report endorses banning smartphones in schools when technology integration does not im- prove learning or worsens student well-being. •\t Excessive screen time has been linked to poorer well-being, less curiosity, self-control, emotional stability, and higher anxiety and depression diagno- ses in children. •\t Advocates for data privacy laws to protect children’s information Use: The issues and recommendations can be used in ques- tion-related to education/learning at school/Screen addic- tion among children. MANGROVE MITRA PRO- GRAMME (ODISHA) Context: At least 25 families in Odisha’s Kendrapara district have donated over 25 acres of their land near Bhitarkani- ka National Park (BNP) for mangrove plantation under the Mangrove Mitra Programme. The park has 82 mangrove species, but the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture has degraded the mangrove habitats in the region. The land donation is aimed at regenerating mangrove for- ests during the monsoon season. The Bhitarkanika man- grove ecosystem is India’s second-largest, but it has suffered losses due to deforestation caused by resettlement and hu- man activities. Activists emphasize that mangrove forests of- fer the best insurance against such natural calamities. The 2021 Forest Survey of India report said the mangrove forest cover in the country increased by 17 square km over the previous two years. Use: The initiative shows the values of Environmental stew- ardship and conservation, Community solidarity and collab- oration, and Recognition of the importance of natural eco- systems for protection against calamities. Facts for Prelims (FFP) ANCIENT SOIL FROM BENEATH A MILE OF ICE IN GREENLAND OFFERS WARNINGS FOR THE FU- TURE Context: Approximately 400,000 years ago, large parts of Greenland were ice-free, and evidence suggests it was cov- ered in spruce trees and scrubby tundra. •\t Scientists have now determined the precise date of www.insightsonindia.com6 this ice-free period to be around 416,000 years ago, lasting for about 14,000 years. •\t Researchers extracted frozen soil from beneath the Greenland ice sheet, collected during the Cold War from Camp Century, a unique nuclear-powered base dug into the ice sheet. The findings have implications for our understanding of cli- mate change and the consequences of rising carbon diox- ide levels. During the interglacial period similar to today’s conditions, CO2 levels were much lower, yet they triggered enough warming to melt a significant portion of Green- land’s ice. To prevent a future of largely ice-free Greenland, it is crucial to take immediate and significant action to reduce carbon emissions and sequester carbon from the atmosphere. CONSTITUTION (STS) ORDER (5TH AMENDMENT) BILL Context: The Parliament has passed the Constitution (Sched- uled Tribes) Order (Fifth Amendment) Bill, 2022, with the Rajya Sabha giving its approval after the Lok Sabha had already passed the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Constitution (Sched- uled Tribes) Order of 1950. It aims to make several changes: •\t Inclusion of Communities: The Bill includes the Dha- nuhar, Dhanuwar, Kisan, Saunra, Saonra, and Bin- jhia communities in the list of Scheduled Tribes in Chhattisgarh. •\t Synonyms Inclusion: The Bill adds Bhuinya, Bhui- yan, and Bhuyan communities as synonyms for the Bharia Bhumia community. •\t Devanagari Versions: Three Devanagari versions of the name of the Pando community are also includ- ed. NO CONFIDENCE MOTION Context: The current No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Indian government was brought by the opposition to de- mand a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the situation in Manipur. However, given the government’s significant majority in the Lok Sabha, the motion is unlikely to succeed. About NCM Description What is NCM? A No Confidence Motion is a parliamenta- ry procedure used to test the government’s support and majority in the legislature. In In- dia, it is introduced in the Lok Sabha, and if ac- cepted, it leads to a discussion on the govern- ment’s performance. If the motion is passed, the government must resign from office. Floor Test The government can retain power by demon- strating its strength through a floor test. Principle of Collec- tive Re- sponsibil- ity According to Article 75 of the Constitution (and Article 164 for states), the council of min- isters is collectively responsible to Lok Sabha. The ministry remains in office as long as the majority of Lok Sabha members trust it. Lok Sabha Rule 198 specifies the procedure for a motion of no-confidence. Pr oc e - dure for Mo vi n g Motion The member must submit a written notice before 10 AM, supported by at least 50 mem- bers. The Speaker sets a date for discussion within 10 days. Examples 27 no-confidence motions have been intro- duced in Lok Sabha since independence. Diff er - ence from Cen su r e Motion The no-confidence motion seeks to ascer- tain the confidence of the Lok Sabha in the Council of Ministers, while a censure motion censures specific policies and actions of the Council of Ministers. If a no-confidence motion is passed, the coun- cil of ministers must resign, while a censure motion does not require resignation. S i gn i fi - cance The no-confidence motion is a crucial legis- lative tool used to hold the government ac- countable, although it is rare for the oppo- sition to defeat the ruling party with greater numbers. A MECHANISM THAT QUIETLY RE- MOVES UNFIT CELLS BEFORE YOU’RE BORN Context: Research on the early stages of human embryonic development and the role of specific cells known as the in- ner cell mass has gained importance recently. •\t The inner cell mass contains pluripotent cells, mean- ing they have the potential to differentiate into all the different cell types that make up the human body. These cells are of great interest to scientists as they are responsible for shaping the entire human body. •\t In a study conducted in 2016, researchers discov- ered a subset of non-committed cells within the inner cell mass. Unlike the majority of cells in the inner cell mass that go on to contribute to the devel- oping embryo, these non-committed cells seem to die off early in the development process. •\t Further investigation revealed that the non-com- mitted cells lack the expression of a gene called HERVH, which is critical for maintaining pluripoten- cy in human embryonic stem cells. •\t Instead, these cells express transposons, also www.insightsonindia.com7 known as “jumping genes,” which can insert themselves into different parts of the genome, potentially causing DNA damage and leading to cell death. HERVH, despite being a type of transposon itself, appears to protect the pluripotent cells from the harmful effects of other transposons. By the end of this early developmental stage, the cells that express HERVH survive and become the “good” cells that will form the embryo, while the non-committed cells that lack HERVH expression die through cell death. The study refers to the early human embryo as a “selection arena,” where cells compete to survive based on their gene expression patterns. Mapping ISRAEL Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has succeeded in pushing through a judicial reform bill that curtails the judi- ciary’s power to check his far-right coalition government. The victory, however, has deepened divisions in Israeli society. Critics fear that the reform may lead to a religious autocracy, erode democracy, and pose risks to Israel’s alliance with the United States. Israel, a Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea, is regarded by Jews, Christians and Muslims as the biblical Holy Land. Its most sacred sites are in Jerusalem.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
