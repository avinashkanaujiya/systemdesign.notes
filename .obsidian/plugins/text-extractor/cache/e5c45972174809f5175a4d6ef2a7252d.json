Present Status • Every year, mega Indian cities witness nearly 50,000 accidents. A quarter of them are fatal. • More than half of these are on account of over speeding and a quarter due to dangerous driving. • Nearly half of those who lose their lives are pedestrians. • Almost half of these avoidable deaths are due to collisions with buses and trucks. Impact of Road safety on Environment • Vehicle crashes adversely impacted the environment in various ways and in different degrees. • Most vehicles contain toxic metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium or hexavalent chromium, which are detrimental to the environment. Automobile Scrappage • Severe road crashes lead to automobile wreckage, which gives rise to scrappage. • Despite being one of the largest car and light commercial vehicle markets in the world, India’s National Automobile Scrappage Policy, launched in 2021, is still in its nascent stages. • Vehicle landfills turn into automobile graveyards leading to wasteful and sub-optimal land usage and water and soil pollution for decades. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS Speeding limits • One of the biggest factors for road crashes is speeding. • Speeding has consistently been responsible for over 60% of all road crash fatalities in India in the last five years. • Studies show that cutting motorway speed limits even by 10 km/h can deliver 12% to 18% fuel savings for current technology passenger cars, along with a significant reduction in pollutant emissions. • Several governments globally have reduced speed limits to prevent crashes and lower air pollution. • In India, the Zero-Fatality Corridor solution for road safety by the SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF) focuses on reducing speeding through advanced engineering and enforcement technologies. • Technology tools and deploying artificial intelligence would introduce necessary deterrence for traffic violations. Concerns / Challenges • Vegetation on or very close to the road stretches often falls prey to road widening initiatives. • Missing or inadequate signages are another leading cause of road crashes. • It is a common standard practice to use asbestos for creating these signages. Asbestos has an adverse impact on the environment. • The propensity of people to use personal vehicles instead of public transport also adds to the chaos. Way Forward • Guarding hard structures such as trees using crash barriers to prevent direct collisions. • Installing retro reflective signage on the trees to make them more visible to commuters. • Building green corridors to go over forests and animal paths. • Scaling this will have a profound impact on preserving the environment while ensuring better road connectivity. • Roads and the environment are inseparable spaces. They are not just our shared resources but also our joint responsibility. • Therefore, safer roads and a sustainable environment can be ensured only through the joint efforts of road-owning agencies, enforcement officials and the public.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
