(15/250) Theory 4 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish FEDERALISM INTRODUCTION  It is a form of government in which the sovereign authority or political power is divided between the Centre and the States, each of whom are independent in their own sphere. ESSENTIAL FEATURES  Dual Polity / Distribution of power: Usually, matters of national importance are entrusted with the Centre, whereas local matters remain with state.  Supremacy of the Constitution: Having the powers originate from the constitution ensure no authority arbitrarily takes over the powers of the other.  Written Constitution: ensures there is no misunderstanding or disagreements.  Rigidity of the constitution: A rigid constitution makes amendments very complicated and tough, thus ensuring that none of the governments can change it unilaterally. And any change in the constitution stems from both the authorities.  Authority of the courts: Since federalism is based on division of power between co-ordinate governments, it is essential to maintain the same and ensure none transgresses into the domain of other. This has to be done by some independent and impartial authority i.e. The judiciary. The Judiciary has the final authority to interpret the constitution and sit as an arbitrator of disputes between Centre and state. CENTRALISING FEATURES OF INDIAN FEDERALISM  Emergency provisions  Integrated judiciary  Sharing of revenue through FC  Concurrent list  Residual powers lie with the Centre  States not destructible  Flexibility of the Constitution  Veto over State Bills  Appointment of Governor  Parliament’s authority over State list 5 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish FEDERAL FEATURES OF CONSTITUTION  Dual polity (Art 1) (Art 246)  Supremacy of Constitution (Art 368)  Written Constitution (Art 368)  Rigidity of Constitution (Art 368)  Independent judiciary (Art 131) ACTS GIVING CENTRE THE POWER TO ISSUE DIRECTIONS TO STATE GOVERNMENTS (LATEST CA: DURING COVID-19 LOCKDOWN)  Farm acts have been implemented under the Concurrent list. Therefore, laws will be upheld even if the States oppose.  The DMA, enforced during the Covid-19 pandemic, has been enacted under the residual powers.  Epidemic Diseases Act: Health is a state subject, but by invoking the provisions under this Act, advisories and directions of MoH&FW will be enforceable. DEVIATIONS FROM FEDERAL CHARACTERISTICS/ UNITARY BIAS  Article 1 mentions India i.e., Bharat as a Union of states and not a federation of states.  Legislative Relations:  Article 248 confers residuary power in the Union  U/a 249 Parliament is empowered to make law with matters enumerated in List II, if necessary, in national interest.  Power of Parliament to legislate with respect to any matter in the State List if a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation u/a 249.  Parliament can also make laws for the states if two or more states request the parliament for the same u/a 252.  Similarly, for giving effect to international agreements, Parliament can make any legislation (Article 253)  In case of inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and the state with respect to concurrent list matters, the laws made by parliament will prevail over law made by state to the extent of inconsistency (Article 254) 6 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Previous sanction of President is required to introduce certain bills in state legislature u/a 304  Financial Relations:  States largely depend upon the center for financial assistance through grants-in-aid. Further the taxation power of state is comparatively restricted as compared to the Union because more important taxes such as income tax, wealth tax , excise duty etc. are reserved for the Union.  Executive/ Administrative Relations  U/a 256,the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament  U/a 257 talks about control of union over states in certain situations , wherein the Union will have the power to give such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose.  Article 356 authorizes the President to hold that governance of a state is not being carried ed out in accordance with the constitution ,if the state fails to comply with directions of the Union and can impose State emergency.  Article 312 which speaks about all India Services ensures that the officers of such service at the state level ensure that Union’s law and policy ae being implemented properly.  Parliament’s power to form new states and alter the boundaries of existing sates u/a 3 proves that states do not enjoy territorial integrity and depend upon the sweet will of the Union.  Appointment of Governor- Governors are appointed by President and answerable to him, hence they act in a manner suitable to the center (as they are an agent of center in the state) even at the cost of the interest of the sates.  Emergency Provisions: During emergency the normal distribution of power undergoes drastic change, in favor of center. U/a 356 state legislatures can be dissolved, and President’s rule can be imposed.  Freedom of trade and commerce: The provisions of part XIII seek to make India a single comprehensive economic unit for purpose of trade and commerce under the overall control of the Union.  Single and uniform citizenship for the whole of India ,unlike USA where states have separate citizenship.  Uniform and integrated Judicial system ▪ Hence India is considered as an “Indestructible Union of destructible states” 7 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish SUPREME COURT’S VIEWS  In Ram Jawaya Kapoor, it held federal principle or doctrine of separation of power is not incorporated in Indian constitution in strict and rigid form.  In State of West Bengal V UOI, court said “Indian constitution is not truly federal because Union enjoys greater power and state are not co-ordinate of the Centre.  In State of Haryana V UOI, it held that a semi-federal system of government has been adopted in India.  Kuldip Nayyar v UOI – though federal principle is dominant and one of the basic features, but it is true that federalism in India leans towards a strong Centre. NATURE OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION  Austin and A.H. Birch used the term “Cooperative federalism’ for Indian system i.e. Neither purely federal nor purely unitary but combination of both. To ensure cooperation between the two, strong Centre is there but regional governments are not weak and there is mutual dependence amongst the two.  Dicey feels federalism has been watered down in India in order to meet the needs of a country which has to remain nationally integrated, politically and economically coordinated and socially uplifted. (Quoted in State of Rajasthan Union of India)  Dr Ambedkar considers Indian constitution both federal and unitary depending upon situation and circumstances. CONCLUSION  India adopted a federal structure as different parts of the country were at different stages of development, but we needed a strong Centre to maintain unity and integrity especially considering the heterogeneity of the population and experience of partition. Indian federalism is sui generis / of its own kind because of its mode of formation i.e., from Union to states (Union divided into states) and not vice versa like in case of USA (states came together to form union)  The constitution is neither purely federal nor unitary. It is a Union of composite States as neither the parliament nor the states are sovereign because each of them are limited by the constitutional provisions affecting the distribution of power.  Thus, Indian constitution is mainly federal with unique safeguards for enforcing national unity and growth 8 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish ASYMENTRICAL FEDERALISM  It is understood to be the unequal distribution of power amongst the constituting units of a federation in political, administrative and fiscal spheres. In India, this asymmetry is both vertical (between centre and states ) and also horizontal (amongst the states )  Like many federations, India has certain de facto asymmetrical federal features with regard to differences of size, population, wealth, and influence between the federating units VERTICAL ASYMMETRY  It is a settled fact that India is not a true federation because the of the strong unitary tendencies. The main provisions which point to this asymmetry are –  In India only the union is indestructible and not the states because they have no defined territory integrity as is clear from Article 3.  Creation of Union Territories.  Emergency provisions.  States do not have equal say in case of amendments and are asked to ratify law only if their interest is involved.  Centre enjoys an overall legislative, administrative and fiscal precedence over the states in India. HORIZONTAL ASYMMETRY A) Among States: Not all states are equal in India and there is difference in order to accommodate specific local, historical and geographical contexts.  Unequal representation in Rajya Sabha based on the population of the state.  Special provisions’ applicable to some States u/a 371 by empowering the Governors to discharge some special responsibilities, which he does in his discretion.  Article 371 says the Governor of Maharashtra has a special responsibility to establish separate development boards for Vidarbha, Marathwada, and the rest of the State, while the Governor of Gujarat has a similar responsibility towards Saurashtra, Kutch and the rest of Gujarat.  Under Article 371A no law made by Parliament in relation to Naga customary law and procedure, including civil and criminal justice matters, and ownership or transfer of land and resources will apply to Nagaland, unless the Legislative Assembly of Nagaland decides so. Further, the Governor of Nagaland has a ‘special responsibility’ regarding law and order in the State. 9 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Article 371B contained a special provision for Assam under which a committee of legislators from the tribal areas was formed to look after their interest. The tribal areas later became Meghalaya State.  Under Article 371C, the Hill Areas of Manipur ought to have a committee of legislators. The Governor has a special responsibility to make an annual report to the President on the administration of the Hill Areas. The Centre is empowered to give directions to the State as far as these areas were concerned.  The Sixth Schedule to the Constitution contains provisions for the administration of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. These create autonomous districts and autonomous regions administered by District Councils and Regional Councils. These Councils can make laws with respect to allotment, occupation and use of land, management of forests, regulate social customs, marriage and divorce and property issues. e.g., In Assam, the Karbi- Anglong Autonomous Council, Dima Hasao Autonomous District Council etc. Ladakh has two autonomous hill development councils (Leh and Kargil). The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council is in West Bengal. B) Among Union Territories: Union territories are also not equal as –  Puducherry and Delhi have legislatures, while the other territories under the Centre do not have legislatures or a ministerial council to advise the administrator.  Even between Puducherry and Delhi, there is a notable difference as Puducherry has legislative powers on any matter mentioned in the State List or the Concurrent List, insofar as it applies to the Union Territory but Delhi cannot make laws on matters of police, land and public order.  However, Parliament has overriding powers over any law made by the Assembly in the Union Territories.  Puducherry has one more unique feature. Despite being a single administrative unit, the Union Territory is ‘non-contiguous’. That is, its territory is not limited to one extent of land as it has enclaves located within other States: Karaikal (Tamil Nadu) Yanam (Andhra Pradesh) and Mahe (Kerala). IMPORTANCE OF ASYMMETRIC FEDERALISM IN INDIA  Ensures unity in diversity as it helps to respects and preserve vulnerable groups through special powers.  Satisfy different needs of various federal units which are a result of an ethnic, linguistic or cultural difference  Help to protect fundamental rights and compensate for initial inequalities in the social system. 10 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Allowance for separate laws to govern different religious groups, and provisions for various kinds of affirmative action for extremely disadvantaged groups help in ensuring social justice to them.  Gives better representation to minority areas in the democracy COOPERATIVE AND COMPETITIVE FEDERALISM  Federalism is form of government where there is distribution of power amongst two or more coordinate authorities who are independent in their sphere.  Based on the relationship between the central and state government–the concept of federalism is divided into- Co-operative federalism and Competitive federalism. In short, Term Definition Examples Cooperation (includes Cooperative federalism) Centre = States Share a horizontal relationship Schedule VII, NITI Aayog, Zonal councils, NDC, COVID-19 Lockdown: cooperation in solving migrant crisis and enhancement of testing facilities Competition (includes Competitive federalism) Centre > States C and S share a vertical relationship S and S share horizontal relationship Post 1991 LPG reforms: attracting FDI & GDP growth rates; More recent: EoDB, Logistics Index, Swachh Bharat Sarvekshan Confrontation Result of Central government transgressing into the powers of the State government Historically: Inter-State Water Disputes, Sharing of taxes, A.356, CBI jurisdiction More recent: GST Act, PM-JAY, recent farm bills COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM  It is a type of federalism wherein the interaction between the constituent authorities is based on “cooperation” so that they can collectively use their energy and resources to promote and maximize public welfare and national goals.  Governments in cooperative federalism share a horizontal relation rather than a hierarchical one and common policies are promoted not by dictation but by discussions, agreements and compromise.  It is an important tool which enables greater participation of state governments in formulation and implementation of national policies. 11 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish Indian Constitution envisages in the spirit of Cooperative federalism –  Schedule VII gives the three lists and provides for the center-state cooperation on legislative matters.  U/a 263 Interstate council has been provided to resolve any kind of disputes between the center and the states or amongst states  Establishment of zonal councils under state reorganization act 1956, as instruments of intergovernmental consultation and cooperation.  National Development Council (NDC) is the apex body for decision making and deliberations on development matters has representation from both the Centre and State. Thereby making states part of development process  Interstate water disputes Act and River Boards Act provide means to adjudicate disputes relating to using and sharing of interstate rivers.  The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendment introduced Panchayati raj (Rural) and Municipality (Urban) system to strengthen the roots of cooperative federalism in India OTHER MEASURES TAKEN IN RECENT PAST  Abolition of the erstwhile Planning Commission and setting up of NITI Aayog which has made states a party to the developmental plan and policies of the government.  Implementation of GST and establishment of GST council  Increase in the share of divisible tax-pool from 32% to 42% for the states as per recommendation of 14th Finance Commission.  The NITI Forum for North East has been constituted and tangible sectoral proposals are being implemented by the States in partnership with the North East council. CHALLENGES  Trust deficit between Centre and States  Multiparty system  Regionalism, terrorism, naxalism etc.  Superior legislative power of the center due to residuary power and legislative precedence  Wider taxation power to the center etc. 12 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish COMPETITIVE FEDERALISM  In Competitive federalism there is competition between the Centre and the State and also amongst the State governments, to get maximum benefits in order to facilitate better administration and enhances developmental activities.  Post 1990s economic reform gave ground to the idea of competitive federalism as inequalities and disparity grew. Today in a free market economy, endowments, funds, investments, available resources etc. all have fostered a healthy competition where every government is striving to get the maximum in order to improve physical and social infrastructure within the state. Competitive federalism follows the concept bottom-up approach as it will bring the change from the states.  For e.g. The investors prefer more developed states for investing their money. Union government devolves funds to the states on the basis of usage of previously allocated funds. STEPS TAKEN TO FOSTER COMPETITIVE FEDERALISM  Competitive federalism though is not part of the basic structure of Indian constitution but of late is being actively encouraged by the Central Government especially NITI Aayog in order to fasten the development in the states.  The NITI Aayog will also provide for the appointment of Regional Councils with specific mandates for specific time period  The central government enhanced the borrowing limit of state governments from 3 percent to 5 percent of their gross state domestic product.  States compete to attract FDI. And positively so, the Centre is not being seen as an obstacle but as a facilitator. Still, approval for FDIs is centralized with the DPIIT being the nodal Ministry at the centre for FDI approvals.  Para-diplomacy by the States - INVEST IN VIBRANT GUJARAT  Restructuring of centrally sponsored Schemes.  Financial sector bailout programme under UDAY scheme to state DISCOMs  Aspirational District Programme and Smart cities Mission.  It promotes competitive federalism principally through pushing its sectoral indices which are put out in the public domain. The indices on water, education, health, innovation, export preparedness, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have attracted significant positive attention. State wise Ease of Doing Business ranking to build a huge sense of competition.  Ranking states on various social indicators - Swachh Bharat Ranking system, School education quality index, composite water management index. SDG India Index etc. 13 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish SOME EXAMPLES OF STATES MOVING TOWARDS COMPETITIVE FEDERALISM  Though competitive federalism has not been embraced by all states, however some of them have jumped the bandwagon by facilitating reforms in terms of ease of doing business ,expediting the pending project clearances ,attracting investments etc. Most of the state now organizes investors meet to showcase facilities in their state to attract business and investment. This has led to improvement in business environment in various state.  Gujarat has amended its land acquisition act to attract more investment.  Maharashtra has amended the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, allowing the sale of certain publicly-owned lands that were previously slated only for leasing.  The Andhra Pradesh legislature has passed a bill extending land leases from the government to private entities from 33 years to 99 years.  Gujarat and Karnataka have passed various reforms in labour laws.  Uttar Pradesh has approved the Uttar Pradesh Information Technology & Start-Up Policy 2016. To encourage start-up growth, the policy waives taxes on land purchased for office use, as well as electricity dues for five years. CHALLENGES  Despite Centre increasing the States’ share of the divisible pool, the revenue of the states have come down because of which allocation towards social sector schemes has also reduced.  It is in a way increasing gap between developed and under developed states.  Not all states are taking equal part and only richer states like Gujrat ,Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu etc are competing.  The present inter-state competition in attracting investment is too early to determine whether it will really encourage competitive patterns of investment on a continuous basis.  Since the socio-economic parameters and development of each State in India is different, only those states who have made substantial progress in terms of employment, literacy and creating a conducive environment for doing business and investments are actually competing . other states are mute spectators.  The states like West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Assam have protested against the uniform approach in funding because of their special situations in which the central government has to provide special funds to these states. Without special funding these states cannot imagine their participation in competitive federalism.  Though the states are provided with financial independence, not all states would perform uniformly in the process of development because while some states have favorable factors 14 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish like skilled labour, capital and infrastructure, innovative service industries other states lagging behind. ARE THEY BOTH COMPLEMENTARY? WHAT SHOULD INDIA FOLLOW?  Though cooperative and competitive federalism seem to be contrary, they are in fact sides of the same coin as they have the same basic underlying principle – progress of the nation as a whole. In fact, the NITI Aayog e-book talks of competitive federalism as a force multiplier to achieve the objective of cooperative federalism.  Competitiveness is an idea that has stood the test of time and India can only achieve its ambitious growth targets by enhancing competitiveness at all levels of government. However, improving competitiveness requires economic and social development, which in turn requires coordination of our economic and social policies across various levels of government.  For example, implementing GST required consensus among states and now, we have the GST Council, with states as equal members who are part of national fiscal policy.  Another example is India’s improvement in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. We have been able to jump 65 positions in the rankings only because states brought about many reforms. This was made possible through the creation of an EoDB Index for Indian States and the release annual rankings to indicate areas in which they are lagging.  Another major success story is Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) which is a programme with convergence, collaboration and competition as the core tenets. States are the main drivers behind this programme but are working with central government detect opportunities for immediate improvement.  Similarly promoting one Smart City in each state is cooperative federalism but states encouraged to come up with their own plans for smart cities is competitive federalism.  In future also agriculture can be reformed in the same way. Though agriculture is state subject, however we need coordination and consensus-building to unlock the agriculture market in India. Prime Minister has already established establishing a “high-powered committee of chief ministers” to recommend reform in Indian agriculture markets.  The two together will also lead to good governance as there is naming the best performers and shaming the worst. Since these rankings are in the public domain, the accountability of both elected officials and administrators has risen, thereby leading to good governance  Nudge of the competition ensures that states work hard towards reform and improve their social parameters. But at the same time cooperative federalism provides motivation and the support to the states to up their game and contribute in nation building. 15 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish WHAT INDIA CAN DO TO IMPROVE?  Cooperative and competitive federalism are complementary ideas that will drive India’s growth story in the coming decades. However certain reforms can be done to improve both.  Centre’s support would be required by some states, like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, NE states etc to have a meaningful participation in competitive federalism some states are deficit or backward, hence they should not be treated at par with the well-off states.  Strong states make strong nation and to realize this vision, it requires a “Team India” approach to work for India’s development.  Reconstitution of the Inter State Council recently is a step in the right direction  State must be given greater autonomy with regards to issues like health, education, land, labour, natural resources etc.  States/UTs should be assisted through the help of expert panels to make competitive and robust policies which are more acceptable and transparent  On contentious issues like land, labour and natural resources, a sound mechanism should be developed to resolve issues and promote development  On issues like international treaties, WTO obligations, or the environment an institutional mechanism must be evolved where important decisions are appropriately discussed with states.  Best practices amongst states should be widely publicized. CONCLUSION India needs a mix of both competitive and cooperative federalism or as NITI Aayog calls its competitive cooperative federalism, to move ahead. In fact, instituting a system of cooperative and competitive federalism has been a hallmark of India’s policy-making in the past five years and has achieved considerable results. Competition is required to fight the complacency of cooperation and cooperation helps to balance out the vigor of competition. • A diverse and large country like India requires a proper balance between the six pillars of federalism: autonomy of states, national integration, centralisation, decentralisation nationalisation, and regionalisation. • Extreme political centralisation or chaotic political decentralisation can both lead to the weakening of Indian federalism. • Controlling these extremes is a challenge, as federalism must reconcile the need for national unity on the one hand, and on the other, regional autonomy. 16 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish 15TH FINANCE COMMISSION • Introduction • Mandate Issues • Allocation Criteria • Resources • Expenditure Issues INTRODUCTION • The final report of the Fifteenth Finance Commission is titled “Finance Commission in COVID Times—Report for 2021–26 • The commission’s term was ex- tended by one year in November 2019 after the bifurcation of the state of J&K in August 2019 • This was the First Finance Commission of the post-planning commission era • Second FC to submit two reports • Key Data Points • 6 Hindi Belt States (42.85% Population) – 48.57% of shareable pool • 5 Southern States (21.32 % Population) – 15.87% of shareable pool • 7 Northern/Eastern/Western States (30.61 % Population) – 25.31.87% of shareable pool • 8 NE States (sans J&K) (5.32 % Population) – 10.48% of shareable pool MANDATE ISSUES • Article 280(4) of the Constitution gives the finance commission absolute independence to “determine their procedure” and exercise “such powers in the performance of their functions as Parliament may by law confer on them • Some clauses of TOR alleged to affect federal fiscal balance • measurable performance-based incentives for states • progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth, implementation of flagship schemes, promoting ease of doing business, sanitation, solid waste management and bringing in behavioural change to end open defecation • expansion and deepening of tax-net under GST • control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures 17 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish • Larger issues of public financial management on which the commission neither has the authority nor the expertise, and for which bodies of elected representatives should be the appropriate fora. • The term “populism” itself is open to differing interpretations and changing perceptions ALLOCATION CRITERIA • As per Article 280(3) of the Constitution, the primary task of a finance com-mission is to • make recommendations for the horizontal and vertical sharing of the net proceeds of taxes in the divisible pool between the union and the states • determine the principles for union government grants-in-aid to the states • recommending measures to supplement the resources of the local bodies. • Finance commissions’ recommendations broadly follow three principles: • Equity - parameters like population and area of a state – • 10% weightage to the 2011 population to take into account the demographic changes, including interstate migration, since 1971; • It changed the population criteria from 1971 Census to 2011 Census, which upset most states outside the Hindi heartland as it placed them at a disadvantage for successfully containing heir population growth • Equalisation - parameters related to the distance of per capita income or fiscal capacity of a state from the most prosperous one - 50% weightage to in- come distance, 15% to area, and 7.5% to the forest cover in a state • Efficiency - parameters such as tax effort and fiscal discipline – NO specific criteria • 42% after raising it by 10%, while reducing the grants drastically • 42% reduced to 41% allocating 1% for J&K RESOURCES • Recommendation for reducing off budget borrowings and for ensuring the stability of direct tax rates and thresholds have already been acted upon by the finance minister in the 2021–22 budget • However, another important recommendation was ignored  restoration of the revenue neutrality of the GST rates 18 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  recommended for a rationalised structure of GST by merging the rates of 12% and 18% slabs and converging into a three-rate structure of a merit rate, a standard rate, and a demerit rate of around 28%–30%  The need for reducing the multiplicity of rates that gives rise to endless classification disputes and for simplifying the GST structure are long overdue, and its in- deed time the governments act on this. • Indexing the professional tax, which is levied by 21 states at the 1988 rate with a ceiling of only `2,500 on income from professions, etc, for the accumulated inflation since then, which will immediately raise the ceiling to 18,000. EXPENDITURE ISSUES • It recommended that health expenditure should constitute more than 8% of their budget by 2022 • public health expenditure of the union and the states together should be in- creased in a progressive manner to reach 2.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025 • Given that the current healthcare expenditure is less than 1%, the allocation is unlikely to achieve the target of 2.5% of the GDP by 2025. • The commission also did not indicate any road map for this, except broadly recommending increases in allocation by individual states and the union. • It has, however, correctly noted that centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) such as the National Health Mission and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) account for the major healthcare expenditure of the union, which are primarily top-driven and need much more flexibility for the states to “adapt and innovate” to tailor these to their specific needs; besides, there is also an urgent need to shift the focus from inputs to outputs and outcomes, away from the current focus on line items and activities • The commission drew attention to the fact that 15 of the 30 umbrella CSS account for 90% of the total allocation under CSS. POLICY IDEAS • a dedicated non-lapsable modernisation fund for defence and internal security (MFDIS) in the Public Account of India to bridge the gap between the projected capital requirements and budgetary allocations for modernisation of de- fence and state police forces. • recommended a restructuring of the Fiscal Regulation and Budget Management (FRBM) Acts of the union and the states after the examination by a high-powered intergovernmental group. 19 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish • suggested introduction of a system of credit rating of the states • setting up of an independent, advisory fiscal council with powers to access governmental records. SPECIAL CASES- SPECIAL AREAS UTs • Similar to many federations, India has certain de facto asymmetrical federal features with regard to differences of size, population, wealth, and influence between the federating units • Nagaland (Article 371A of the Constitution), • Sikkim (Article 371F), and Mizoram (Article 371G) • Jammu and Kashmir (Article 370 of the Constitution abrogated in August 2019) • Further, the Fifth Schedules of the Constitution comprise numerous distinctive provisions for administration and protection of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in any state • States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram (Sixth Schedule). • UTs are administered in accordance with the provision of Articles 239 to 241 of the Constitution. • The justification for the creation of separate union territories is due to their small size, far- flung locations on the coasts, cultural heterogeneity, interstate disputes, particular needs of National Capital Territory (NCT), different colonial heritage etc. • In terms of the economic powers of union territories, it needs to be emphasised that all union territories, except Delhi and Puducherry—which have their own legislative assemblies—have limited financial powers and lack their own public accounts • Thus, they do not have their own budgets and, therefore, no powers of taxation • Rather, their revenues and expenditures are part of the union budget, under the budget head of the home ministry. • Delhi and Puducherry have unlimited powers as long as they are generating their own resources. However, the budget presented by the government of the NCT of Delhi before being presented to the Delhi legislative assembly needs a prior approval of the President, exercised by the home minister. UNION TERRITORY OF PUDUCHERRY • Puducherry comprises four enclaves of former French India: Puducherry district—formerly Pondicherry district, and the capital of the union territory—after which it is named; Karaikal district bounded by Tamil Nadu; Yanam district situated between Andhra Pradesh and the Bay of Bengal; and Mahé district enclosed by Kerala. 20 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish • Four-language Formula - The language formula says that Tamil will be the official language for all or any of official purposes, whereas Malayalam may be used for the official purpose in the Mahé region, and Telugu in the Yanam region. English has been given the status of a link language and may be used in all or any of the regions. • Nomination Powers of Lieutenant Governor - the Supreme Court upheld the induction of the three BJP members as MLAs in the assembly of the union territory of Puducherry by the centre unilaterally without consulting the elected local Congress government. • SC Pending case - Union of India v K. Lakshminarayanan: Whether Lt. Gov is Admin Head of Puducherry Govt DELHI • Delhi owes its distinctive status to its long history and its capital city-state status • As the capital of the nation, Delhi performs certain unique functions such as aiding the union government to fulfil its constitutional mandate of maintaining macroeconomic stability and handling currency, defence, internal security, external relations and diplomatic missions DELHI DEVELOPMENTS • 69th Amendment to the Constitution in 1991 that added a new Article 239 AA, which renamed the union territory of Delhi as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) and designated the lieutenant governor as the administrator with powers to promulgate an ordinance when the legislative assembly is not in session • it became neither a “state,” nor even a “half-state.” • It remained a union territory, but was granted a legislative assembly, like Puducherry • Government of NCT of Delhi v Union of India 2018: • Lieutenant governor’s agreement is not necessary for every decision the Delhi Government makes • The bone of contention is the “discretionary” nature of reference made by the lieutenant governor to the President under 239AA (4) • The lieutenant governor need not, in a mechanical manner, refer every decision of the ministers to the President. 21 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish LOCAL-SELF GOVERNMENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT In the Rigvedic period, i.e., around 1200 B.C. there were Sabha that has the primary function of the administration of the area. This concept of Sabha gradually converted to the panchayat and it was so called because it was headed by 5 people  In the Medieval period, the Panchayati system deteriorated because of the increase in the Zamindari system in the rural areas.  With the change in the dynasties ruling India, the concept of Kotwal came with the Mughal era whose task was to undertake the administration of the area assigned, to collect tax and other incidental functions.  In the British era, the Government was not in favor of any decentralization, therefore after the mutiny of 1857, they came with the Government of India Act, 1858 and removing the decentralization  Further in the Montego Chelmsford Reforms that were carried out in 1919, right after the World War I wherein England was not in a strong position, some autonomy to the provincial government was given to the provincial government and some powers were given to the elected representatives.  There were two separate Lists under the laws, one for the Governor and second for the elected local representatives.  Further, under the Government of India Act, 1935 all the powers were taken back because both the lists that were legislated were repealed and therefore the decentralization was again withdrawn. POST-1947  Panchayati Raj was kept under the heads of Directive Principles of State Policy under Part IV of the Constitution mainly because of the political instability of the new government and the paucity of funds and therefore it was not practically possible for the newly formed India  Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, 1957: this committee mainly it advocated for the basic level of administration be at the Block level.  K. Santhanam Committee, 1963: advocated that the Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) be given the powers to levy tax and it should become as the main source for the funding of the institution.  Ashok Mehta Committee, 1978: This committee suggested that the Panchayati Raj Institute shall be a two-tier body which should operate at the Zilla level and the Mandal level. The nodal 22 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish area would be at the Block Level (taken care of by the Block Development Officer) and Zilla Parishad shall have an advisory role to both, the State Government and to the Block level institution.  G.V.K. Rao Committee, 1985: this committee again advocated for a three-tier system. It said that the PRIs should be at district and local level. The District Development Officer (DDO) shall be appointed for the main administration of the village units.  L.M. Sanghvi Committee, 1986: this committee advocated that in order to establish a governing body for any part of India, it must be given a Constitutional structure. As a result, 73rd Amendment was made to the Constitution and Part IX A was inserted as PANCHAYATS. BASIC FEATURES  Established in 1992 by the 73rd and 74th Amendment to the Constitution – the Panchayati Raj and the Municipality. Features include:  3 tier system for rural and 2 tier system for urban  Minimum age for voting is 18 years  Minimum age for contesting election is 21 years  1/3rd of seats reserved for women at all levels  Reservations introduced for SC/ST category of persons  Introduction of two bodies – State Election Commission and State Finance Commission 23 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish THE STATUS OF PRIS CAN BE REVIEWED IN TERMS OF FOLLOWING PARAMETERS (i) Conduct of Panchayat elections; (ii) Devolution of Financial Powers; (iii) Devolution of Functions and Functionaries; (iv) Constitution of District Planning Committees (DPCs); (v) Status of Gram Sabha; (vi) PESA of 1996; (vii) Checks and Balances over PRIs and Accountability CONDUCT OF PANCHAYAT ELECTIONS As a result of election to PRIs in States/Union Territories, 2,27,698 Panchayats at village level, 5906 Panchayats at intermediate level and 474 Panchayats at the district level have been constituted in the country. These Panchayats are being manned by about 34 lakhs elected representatives at all levels; of them one-third are women. This is the broadest representative base that exists in any country in the ward. 24 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish DEVOLUTION OF FINANCIAL POWERS  The recommendations of the State Finance Commissions can be divided into three categories: (i) assignment of taxes, duties, levies and tolls to local bodies; (ii) sharing of revenue proceeds; and (iii) transfers on account of grants-in-aid and other financial assistance.  Many of the State Governments have agreed to give PRIs a specific percentage of share in some of the State taxes like land revenue and cess on it, additional stamp duty, entertainment tax, royalties on minerals and mines, forest revenue and market fees; these taxes are less buoyant in nature and have no relation to the powers and functions to be devolved upon Panchayats.  All SFCs have put great emphasis on internal revenue mobilization, but none has suggested any effective mechanism for PRIs to generate their own revenue  However, the SFCs suggest better use of the existing tax jurisdiction by referring the system of property taxation and giving greater autonomy to local bodies in matters relating to tax rate setting  Till such time that they are financially dependent on funds from the State Governments, the State Budgets should specify the amount earmarked for district sector plans under Panchayati Raj as also their distribution among the three tiers. It is suggested that 30-40 percent of a State's Plan be devolved on local bodies as already done in the State of Kerala.  In addition, a part of the finances should be in the form of untied funds so that the funds can be utilized as per the felt needs of the Panchayats.  Training and capacity building of PRI functionaries is essential and devolution of financial resources must be accompanied by suitable strengthening of PRIs through transfer of departmental functionaries. DEVOLUTION OF FUNCTIONS AND FUNCTIONARIES  Initiatives such as taken by Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala need to be taken by all the States and Union Territories if Panchayats are to be established as institutions of local self-government.  In respect of the 29 subjects identified in the Eleventh Schedule it is necessary for the State Governments to clearly identify what would be done by the three tiers of Panchayats at their levels.  NO STATE HAS TRANSFERRED ALL 29 SUBJECTS In short, Local-self-government: formative to contemporary stage Formative phase- ‘functions, functionaries and funds’  Initiatives like MP and Kerala should be taken by all States and UTs 25 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  In respect of the 29 subjects under the Eleventh Schedule, State govts need to clearly identify the functions of the various tiers of Panchayats at their levels  No State has transferred all 29 subjects  Devolution of financial powers are decided by the SFC  Emphasis has been put on internal revenue mobilization, but none have suggested measures for PRIs to generate their own revenue Contemporary stage- ‘functionality’ • Encroachment in their functioning by various parastatal bodies of the state such as water development bodies, smart cities special purpose vehicle • Appointment of the Commissioner by the state in the Municipal bodies and Gram Sevak at Panchayat level • Lack of capacity to deal with issues such as climate change, suburban sprawl, demographic dividend etc CONSTITUTION OF DISTRICT PLANNING COMMITTEES  Despite long years of delay, many States are yet to constitute the DPCs. Only nine States, namely, Haryana (just in 3 Districts), Karnataka (10 out of 27 districts), Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and West Bengal and two Union Territories, namely, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Daman & Diu have taken action to constitute DPCs  In Kerala, a Voluntary Technical Corps (VTC) has been created consisting of about 10,000 technical experienced people to vet and re-work projects prepared by the panchayats. STATUS OF GRAM SABHA  It has been observed that most of the State Acts have not spelt the powers of Gram Sabhas nor have any procedures been laid down for the functioning of these bodies.  For instance, (i) the law in most States prescribed at least two meetings of the Gram Sabha in a year. Unfortunately, the minimum has been interpreted as a maximum. (ii) Provision doing away with the need for quorum for adjourned meetings of the Gram Sabha has reinforced the tendency to view Gram Sabha meetings as a mere formality; (iii) State laws set out highly ritualistic functions for the Gram Sabhas. 26 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Gram Sabhas are to recommend and suggest, consider annual accounts, administrative reports, audit notes, etc. These suggestions and recommendations of the Gram Sabhas could be ignored by the Gram Panchayat.  It may be confined to a single village or may span 2-3 villages. Where the Gram Sabhas cover more than one village, their meetings qualitatively are seen to be very poor. PANCHAYATS (EXTENSION TO SCHEDULED AREAS) ACT, 1996  The provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) have come into force on 24th December 1996  The Act extends Panchayats to tribal areas of eight States namely, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan  Enable tribal society to assume control of its own destiny to preserve and conserve the traditional rights over natural resources.  It gives radical self-governance powers to the tribal community and recognizes its traditional community rights over natural resources.  Prior to passage of this Act, laws passed by central and state governments were applied mechanically to tribal areas even when these contravened traditional tribal practices and institutions  In fact, this is the first law that empowers people to redefine their own administrative boundaries  PESA provides that the tribal gram Sabha so defined would be empowered to approve all development plans, control all functionaries and institutions of all social sectors as well as control all minor water bodies, minor minerals and non-timber forest resources. ISSUES  Implementation of the law has been severely hampered by the reluctance of most state governments to make laws and rules that conform to the spirit of the law.  Enforcement of PESA is perceived as weakening the stranglehold of the forest bureaucracy, and it is instructive to study the interpretation of PESA favored by the state governments for attempts to minimize the bureaucratic loss of control.  Governments to make appropriate amendments in their State Laws which impinge on specific provisions contained in the Central Act namely (i) Land Acquisition Act; (ii) Excise Act; 27 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish (iii) State Irrigation Act; (iv) Minor Forest Produce Act; (v) Mines and Minerals Acts; (vi) Land Revenue Code / Act; (vii) SC/ST Land Alienation Act; (viii) Money Lenders Act; and (ix) Regulated Market Act. No doubt, some State Governments (MP) have already amended some of the relevant Acts; others are yet to follow suit. CHECKS AND BALANCES OVER PRIs & ACCOUNTABILITY  Under the State laws, wide powers of suspension and dismissal have been vested in the State bureaucracy. This straightaway places Panchayati Raj Institutions in a position of disadvantage vis-a-vis even middle rung functionaries of State Governments.  Another important aspect of the administrative restructuring process is the merger of District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) with Zilla Parishads. In the light of the 73 Constitution Amendment Act, DRDAs need to be restructured to suit the changed scenario. They should work under the overall control and supervision of the Zilla Parishads.  Instances have been reported where the Gram Panchayat Sarpanches have to spend a good lot of time visiting Block Offices and of harassment by Block level officials  The three tiers also compete for funds and powers. The lower tiers are normally the losers in this process. This would make decentralized development, within a district plan, infructuous and non-sustainable  A massive awareness generation programme needs to be taken up to inform Gram Sabhas about their rights in planning, implementation and audit of development programmed and in control over natural resources, land records and conflict resolution. WAY FORWARD  Popular projects undertaken by the Panchayats by utilizing funds granted by the Finance Commission are Road Construction and maintenance and supply of drinking water.  The Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan has been launched to actively engage Panchayats in generating employment for newly returned migrant workers displaced due to the COVID-19 pandemic; with the Chief Ministers of Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala and Odisha holding regular video-conferences with Sarpanches to review measures taken to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic and generate employment. 28 e-mail: contact@atishmathur.com www.atishmathur.com telegram: https://t.me/csepaper2atish  Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan  Launched for the period of April 2018 to March 2022 with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  The emphasis has been on strengthening Panchayati Raj institutions by ensuring basic orientation training for the Elected Representatives of Panchayats, within six months of their election and refresher trainings within 2years.  Introduction and increased use of e-governance and technology driven solutions at Panchayat level is key for attaining increased administrative efficiency, improved service delivery, and greater accountability. LSG IN TIMES OF COVID-19  Gram panchayats in Odisha worked to ensure that beneficiaries under the ration distribution schemes announced by the Central Government received their entitlement under the public distribution system in advance for three months.  In Sukma, a tribal district in Chhattisgarh, the gram panchayat provided ration to families without waiting for supplies from the state government.  Community kitchens have been set up to provide cooked food for those without access to rations.  In Chhattisgarh’s Kanker district, Sivni gram panchayat’s self-reliance in vegetable production is inspirational.  Gram panchayats across India are supporting transiting migrants, and employment is being generated for displaced migrants.  In many cities, Municipal councils have taken an initiative to sell ‘vegetables on wheels’ to its citizens, so that they do not have to step out of the house to procure them, limiting their contact as far as possible.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
