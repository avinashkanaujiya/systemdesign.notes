Carbon capture and storage Introduction • Carbon capture and storage is a way to grab a planet-heating gas and lock it underground. • But we also need to push all the options to avoid CO2 in the first place. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) • Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a way to catch carbon and trap it beneath the earth. • The captured CO2 is converted into other components and products, such as chemical feedstocks, fuels or building materials • In its latest review of scientific research, the IPCC found that CCS is needed for emissions that are hard to wipe out. • Scientists see a big role for CCS in factories that make cement and fertiliser. Potential of CCS • Captured carbon can be utilised in producing oil or can be used to produce fuels, construction material, chemicals, plastics and algae-based products such as fertilisers and animal feed. • The costs associated with carbon capture can be partially offset by the revenue generated from the utilisation measures. • Helps to phase CO2 from atmosphere. • It helps in accelerating the transition to Circular Carbon Economy. How well does CCS work? Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Some bioethanol plants already report capturing more than 95% of the carbon emissions. • But when it comes to capturing carbon from dirtier gas streams, CCS projects have underdelivered. • Commercial projects have been plagued with problems. • Some have been designed to capture only a fraction of the total emissions. • After decades of pushing the technology, there are only 30 working CCS facilities, according to industry data. How can CCS work better? • In Norway, a German industrial giant is building the first facility to capture carbon from cement and store it underground. • According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), new companies are focusing on specific parts of the problem like transport and storage. • There’s now a bigger focus on storing CO2 than using it to extract more oil. Way Forward • To make the technology grow cheaper and work better, governments need to o tax carbon, o make it easier to approve CCS projects and o help set up the infrastructure around it. • As the technology matures and the associated costs fall further, India should consider designing policies and programs to encourage faster deployment.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
