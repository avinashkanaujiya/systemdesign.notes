Primary Forests Introduction • Forests cover 31% of the Earth’s land surface out of which approximately one-third (34%) are primary forests. What are Primary forests? • Primary forests are forests predominant with native tree species, undisturbed with little to no human interference and the ecological processes are not significantly disrupted. • These forests are the densest, wildest, and of most ecological importance on Earth. • They cover a large geographical area expanding from the snow-covered boreal region to the humid tropics. Global Forest Watch Report • Global Forest Watch reported that a total of 4.1 million hectares of ‘tropical primary forest’ was lost in 2022. • All this forest loss generated CO2 emissions of 2.7 gigatonnes (Gt), equivalent to India’s annual fossil fuel emissions. Why do forests matter? • Protecting forests is one of the most cost-effective ‘land-based’ measures to mitigate climate change. • Forests work as a sink for carbon, provide resources, and harbour the most biodiversity of any ecosystem on Earth. • Forests provide habitat for 80% of amphibian species, 75% of bird species and 68% of mammal species. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS • Tropical forests contain about 60% of all vascular plant species. Forest Loss • The increased forest loss comes in the first year after countries vowed in Leaders’ Declaration on Forest and Land Use to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. • Brazil remains the country with the most tropical primary forest loss. • Forest loss in the Amazon impacts regional rainfall. • The drivers of forest loss across Congo Basin countries are small-scale agriculture and charcoal production. • India lost 43.9 thousand hectares of humid primary forest between 2021 and 2022, which accounts for 17% of the country’s total tree cover loss in the period. Need of the Hour • Increase fire prevention and monitoring efforts. • Termination of granting new licenses on primary forest or peatland. • Renewed commitment not only to protect and restore peatlands but also to rehabilitate mangroves. • Countries should work on halting deforestation and forest degradation by engaging in policy dialogue on sustainable forest use. • Directing more funds for the recovery of depleted forests. Conclusion • Forests are of both direct and indirect use, and hence are aptly termed as an ‘index of prosperity of a nation’. • Keeping in view the benefits which we derive from forests, it is of utmost importance that strong steps be taken to conserve forests.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
