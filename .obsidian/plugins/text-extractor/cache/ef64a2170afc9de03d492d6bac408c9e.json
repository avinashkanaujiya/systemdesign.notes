It proposed to form an All India federation and granted autonomy to the provinces. It was on the provisions of this act that the 1937 provincial elections were conducted and INC ministries were formed in many states. Though it was a signiﬁcant constitutional advance yet the true British intentions can be best summed up in the words of Viceroy Lord Linlithgow : “After all we framed the constitution of 1935 because we thought it the best way to hold India to the empire.” BACKGROUND 1. The INC considered the 1919 GOI act unsatisfactory and the system of dyarchy disappointing. The nationalists were demanding full responsible self government in accordance with the principle of self determination. 2. The British were aware they could not prevent the resurgence of more mass movements only with the use of force. They had to oﬀer bait in the form of constitutional reforms. The idea was to divide the nationalist opinion and co-opt them into the administrative structure. 3. The congress had to be allowed some power to avoid agitations like the Non cooperation movement and the civil disobedience movement. 4. Simon commission had recommended replacement of dyarchy with full responsible government in the provinces 5. GOI Act 1935 borrowed from the following sources: • Simon commission report • Nehru report • White paper published after 3 round table conferences (1930-32) • Electoral reforms mentioned by Lothian commission www.atishmathur.com Telegram : Atish Mathur Oﬃcial The Mains 2021 Crash Course Page of 2 5 PROVISIONS OF THE ACT PROVINCIAL 1. Provincial autonomy was introduced. Full responsible government provided for in place of dyarchy. There were no reserved subjects or executive council in the provinces (1919 act had reserved subjects on which only the governor and his executive council could legislate on). 2. Executive authority was vested with the governor who was appointed by the crown but was to administer the provinces on the advice of the Council of ministers, who in turn were chosen from among the elected members of the provincial legislature and were collectively responsible to them. This was a step ahead towards a proper parliamentary system and responsible government in the Provinces 3. All members in the provincial assembly were directly elected. There was also bicameral legislature in 6 provinces (Bengal, Madras, UP, Bihar, Bombay, Assam). 4. For the scheme of federation, the subjects were divided in 3 lists- The federal, the Provincial and the concurrent legislative list. Residuary powers were vested with the governor general. CENTRE 1. The act proposed to set up an All India Federation comprising of British Indian provinces and princely states. The states were free to join or not join the federation. The federation portion of the act could not come into eﬀect because the condition could not be fulﬁlled- the number of states, the rulers whereof were entitled to choose not less than 50% of 104 seats in council of states had to accede amounting to at least 50% of population . 2. The act introduced dyarchy at the centre with federal subjects divided into reserved and transferred lists. Reserved subjects were to be administered by the governor general on advice of his executive council. This list included important subjects like defence, external aﬀairs etc, The transferred subjects were to be administered on the advice of the council of ministers. 3. The proposed federal legislature was bicameral body consisting of the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House). Upper house was partly nominated by the princes to and partly elected directly to www.atishmathur.com Telegram : Atish Mathur Oﬃcial The Mains 2021 Crash Course Page of 3 5 represent provinces. The members of lower house were indirectly elected by the members of provincial legislatures and nominated by the princes. OTHER FEATURES OF THE ACT 1. The India Act 1935 also provided for the establishment of a Federal Court to adjudicate inter-states disputes and matters concerning the interpretation of the constitution. 2. The Act not only retained the separate electorate(of previous act of 1919) but also enlarged its scope. The anglo Indians and christians were also given separate electorate. Women were given reservation. Reservation for depressed classes was also provided (amendment by Poona pact). 3. No Indian legislature whether federal or provincial was authorised to modify or amend the constitution. Only the British parliament could do so and it’s supremacy was retained. 4. Burma was separated from India with eﬀect from April 1937 5. Abolished the Council of the Secretary of State for India, which was created in 1858. The Secretary of State was to have advisers on its place 6. Act provided for the creation of two new provinces of Sindh from Bombay and Orissa from Bihar. 7. Reserve Bank of India was established. 8. Safeguards were provided for the minorities. It was argued that the minorities needed protection from the dominance of the majority community. But the so-called provisions in the Act relating to safeguards were merely a trick to empower the Governor General and the Governors to override the ministers and the legislators 9. Franchise was extended but still retained property qualiﬁcations. www.atishmathur.com Telegram : Atish Mathur Oﬃcial The Mains 2021 Crash Course Page of 4 5 LIMITATIONS OF THE ACT: 1. The governor could take over control of provincial government in the event of a political breakdown. Similar to article 356 in todays time. 2. Governor had enormous powers on non votable items of the budget which comprised 40% of the budget. Total ﬁnancial autonomy was a missing feature of the act. It limited the powers and autonomy enjoyed by the provinces 3. In the garb of performing their “special responsibilities” like maintaining peace and protecting the interests of minorities etc, the governors could act in his discretion without consulting the ministers. These ambiguous provisions were often use to interfere and gain control of administration whenever it saw the need to Maintain order. 4. The governor would decide if a question arose as to what was in his discretion Or not. Therefore ministerial powers could be curbed by the Governor according to his whims and fancies. 5. There were many subjects on which legislation could not be initiated without The previous consent of the governor general at centre and the governor in the provinces 6. Issues with the system of dyarchy at the centre: • Important departments like defence and foreign aﬀairs were retained in reserved list in which full discretion was retained by the governor general • Control over 80% of the budget (non votable ) • Governor General could still veto a bill passed by both the houses, making the powers to legislate practically redundant. 7. All sections had denounced the proposed federation because : • Muslim leaders felt that the proposed structure is still very unitary and were afraid of the hindu domination • Congress did not like the proposed structure with 1/3rd seats given for nomination to the princes • The Princes did not want to surrender their autonomy and join a democratised federal government, where the elected leaders would have little sympathy for their autocratic rules and press for democratic reforms thereby endangering their powers and autonomy. 8. In the bicameral central legislature, members nominated by princes would constitute 30-40% of seats, thus permanently eliminating a possibility of a Congress or elected majority. Princes were considered conservative with www.atishmathur.com Telegram : Atish Mathur Oﬃcial The Mains 2021 Crash Course Page of 5 5 their Interests aligned with the British. 9. It did not contain a the provisions of dominion status or the bill of rights as envisaged by the Nehru report. The franchise though extended, only included 10% of the population. FEDERAL FEATURES LIMITATIONS SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES WITH THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION Federation proposed with British provinces and princely states. Option given to join Did not operationalise due to required number of princely states did not accede India has a quasi federal system. Though Federation nowhere used in the constitution. “union of states” & “Indestructible union of destructible states “ Provincial autonomy introduced and abolition of dyarchy Governor given powers to dismiss council of ministers and take control of administration. States are autonomous in their own sphere BUT Article 356 in case of breakdown of constitutional machinery and provision to make it unitary in times of emergency (Article 352) Division of subjects in 3 lists for legislative division of powers Governor enjoyed veto powers and prior consent was needed for few subjects. 40% of budget was non votable , lacked ﬁnancial autonomy Schedule 7 lists; central, state and concurrent States vote on their own budget but depend on centre for devolution of funds Council of states at the centre 104 out of 260 represented princely states and therefore not representing provinces with elected legislatures. Unlike the present Rajya sabha Rajya sabha representing the states but has diﬀerent number of seats from diﬀerent states.
