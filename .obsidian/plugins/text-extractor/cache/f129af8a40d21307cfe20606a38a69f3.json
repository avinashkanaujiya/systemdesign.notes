National Research Foundation (NRF) Introduction • Recently the Government decided to setup National Research Foundation (NRF) with the aim to seed, grow and promote research and development (R&D) throughout India’s universities, colleges and research institutions. • It is modelled on the National Science Foundation in the US. Need for NRF • The decision to set up the NRF must be seen as a timely and much-needed move. • Indian scientists today work in silos and the research output of only a few select institutes matches up to global standards. • The NRF could help accomplish one of the NEP’s task of making all higher education institutions teaching as well as research-intensive. • The world has entered a transformative era with the evolution of industry 4.0, web 3.0 and genetics 2.0. • It is the era of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, crypto technologies and human genome projects. • India missed the earlier technological and industrial revolutions. • But this time, it has a huge opportunity to exploit its innate potential. • India has a huge tech-literate young population with high IQ levels. • But we lag behind in areas of fundamental research. • A major push is needed to nudge India’s scientific and technological community into the research and innovation mode. • To make research sensitive to the concerns of rural areas. Insights Mindmap www.insightsonindia.com Page 2 InsightsIAS Recent Developments • In the last few years, the Government has given much impetus to innovation. • More than a million start-ups have sprung up in the last few years, making India the world’s “start- up capital”. • Over 120 start-ups, have become “unicorns”. • An optical fibre cable network of more than 35 lakh kilometres has been laid out. • Electricity and the internet have reached almost all villages. • With over 800 million smartphone users in the country, digital literacy is another major success story. • India’s academics and researchers produced 54 per cent more research papers in the last five years, taking India to the fourth position in the world. Funding Innovation and Research • Most of our innovations are secondary improvements of existing technologies. • But a country of India’s potential should develop institutions of world class research. • This requires funding. • China and the US spend massive sums on R&D. • While India’s private and public funding on R&D is less than 0.7 per cent of its GDP, China spends over 2.5 per cent of its GDP on the same. Patents • India filed over 60,000 patents in 2022. • Almost 50 per cent were local patents filed for the domestic market. • China, on the other hand, filed four million patents in the same year, of which 25 per cent were “high value patents”. Way Forward • R&D in frontier areas is key to India’s ambition to grow as an economic and tech superpower. • The real R&D is about finding answers to questions that have not yet been asked. • The NRF is the instrument to prepare our individuals and institutions for that future-ready task. • The government should take care to ensure the institution’s autonomy.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
