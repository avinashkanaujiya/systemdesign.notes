What is NIRF Ranking? National Institutional Ranking Framework is a methodology developed by the Ministry of Education (formerly the Minis- try of Human Resource Development) in India to rank high- er education institutions in the country. It was launched in September 2015 and aims to provide a comprehensive as- sessment of institutions based on various parameters. Ranking parameters: 1. Teaching, Learning & Resources (30% weightage) 2. Research and Professional Practice (30%) 3. Graduation Outcomes (20%) 4. Outreach and Inclusivity (10%) 5. Perception (10%) www.insightsonindia.com3 Key highlights of the NIRF 2023: Area of Ranking Major Highlights This year’s ranking has integrated the “Innovation” rank- ing previously executed by the Atal Ranking of Institu- tions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA) into the India Rankings to reduce the burden on institutions of providing similar data to two different agencies Participants Increased participation from 3565 institutes in 2016 to 8686 in 2023 Top Engineering Insti- tutes IIT-Madras (1st), IIT-Delhi (2nd), IIT-Bombay (3rd) Top Management In- stitutes IIM Ahmedabad (1st), IIM Banga- lore (2nd), IIM Kozhikode (3rd) Top Law Institutes National Law School of India Uni- versity, Bengaluru (1st), National Law University, Delhi (2nd), NAL- SAR University of Law, Hyderabad (3rd) Top Pharmacy Insti- tutes National Institute of Pharmaceu- tical Education and Research, Hy- derabad (1st), Jamia Hamdard (2nd), BITS Pilani (3rd) Top Colleges Delhi University (DU) colleges se- cured positions in the top 10 col- leges in India, with Miranda House (1st) and Hindu College (2nd) lead- ing the rankings Key issues with the NIRF Ranking: Issues Description Methodology and In- dicators Focus on bibliometric measures (e.g., number of citations, publi- cation rather than the quality of papers) sidelining other forms of intellectual contributions. Lack of Comprehen- sive Evaluation Bibliometric indicators may not fully capture the complexities of scientific performance. Limited Participation Only about 12% of higher educa- tional institutions participated in the ranking process. Urban Bias and Low Progress in Rural Par- ticipation Scant presence of colleges from rural areas in the top 100 rank- ings. The ranking is more concen- trated at institutes in urban areas. Lack of Transparency Institutions and stakeholders should have access to detailed information about the methodol- ogy, data sources, weightage as- signed to different indicators, and the process of data collection and analysis. Lack of rigorous sys- tem An analysis of the data submitted by some private universities under the NIRF provides evidence of data fudging Major challenges pointed out by NIRF ranking for higher education institutes: Incongruence be- tween Quantity and Quality The concentration of high-quality colleges in a few states, highlights the need for a mission to improve quality across the country. Quality Differences between Private and Government Institu- tions Private institutions have lower rankings compared to government institutions. Correlation between Faculty Strength and Rankings Vast differences in faculty strength between top-ranked and other in- stitutions. Importance of quality education beyond infrastructure. Scholarly Output and Research Invest- ments A small percentage of institutions contribute to a significant portion of scholarly output. Need for in- creased research investments and funding. Need for Quality En- hancement and Fi- nancial Resources Rankings highlight the urgent need for improving quality in the higher education system, requiring sub- stantial financial resources. Way forward: To promote comprehensive evaluation of universities in India, it is necessary to move beyond relying solely on bib- liometrics and incorporate a wider range of qualitative and quantitative factors. This will result in a more holistic as- sessment of institutional performance. Additionally, trans- parency in ranking methodologies, the inclusion of diverse factors, and maintaining a balance between quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments are crucial. Conclusion: The rankings underscore the urgent need for quality en- hancement in the higher education system and require sub- stantial financial resources to compete globally.

What is the US-China chips war? The US-China chips war revolves around the rivalry between the two economic powers for dominance in semiconductor technology. The US has implemented restrictions to prevent China from gaining a technological advantage, while also in- vesting in domestic chip manufacturing. China, on the oth- er hand, aims to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors through its “Made in China 2025” plan. The war has dis- rupted global semiconductor supply chains and led to a shift in alliances and trade patterns. In this war, Semiconductors have emerged as the ‘new oil’ Advantages for India in Semiconductor Technology: Advantages Description S t r a t egi c Partnership with the US India has positioned itself as a player in the critical semiconductor technology field with US’s Micron during the recent PM’s visit. Earlier, in 2022, India- US initiative on Crit- ical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) deal was also signed. Government Support and Investment The Indian government has allocated sig- nificant funds and resources, amounting to Rs 76,000 crore ($10 billion), to support the development of the semiconductor in- dustry in the country. E.g. through the PLI scheme. Skille d Workforce India boasts a large pool of skilled profes- sionals in engineering and technology. Growing Do- mestic Mar- ket India offers a vast and expanding domes- tic market for semiconductors and related products. Cost Com- petitiveness India has a competitive advantage in terms of cost, offering relatively lower labour and operational costs compared to some other countries. Infrastruc- ture Devel- opment The Indian government has been actively working on developing the necessary infra- structure to support semiconductor man- ufacturing e.g., the establishment of fab- rication plants (fabs) and semiconductor clusters. What are Semiconductors? A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductiv- ity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Semicon- ductors are used to create electronic circuits, such as tran- sistors and diodes, which control the flow of electric current. They are commonly made from materials like silicon or ger- manium and are essential for various applications, including computers, smartphones, Integrated Circuits, defence sys- tems, and AI India’s initiatives: •\t Production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the semiconductor industry •\t Three entities (Vedanta-Foxconn, international consortium ISMC and Singapore-based IGSS Ventures) that had applied to build the chips •\t Semicon India Programme: Launched in 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore, the programme seeks to support the development of the semiconductors and the display manufacturing ecosystem in India. •\t Fiscal support for a design-linked initiative (DLI) scheme to drive global and domestic investment related to design software, IP rights etc. www.insightsonindia.com5 Global Initiatives for Semiconductors: •\t Semiconductor friend-shoring among the Quad members by USA, to building “resilient, diverse and secure supply chains of critical and emerging tech- nologies”. •\t US-led “Chip 4 Alliance” with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to restrict Chinese access to chip tech. •\t Taiwan produces over 60% of the world’s semicon- ductors and over 90% of the most advanced ones. •\t “Made in China 2025” plan: to get self-sufficiency in semiconductor Challenges for India: •\t India is currently at least two decades behind in chip manufacturing •\t It lacks the necessary infrastructure, uninterrupted power and water supply, and a skilled workforce. •\t There is a need for the development of a compre- hensive chip ecosystem and ancillary industries in India. Conclusion: Despite these challenges, India’s partnership with the US positions it in the global chip war and has the potential to elevate bilateral ties to the next level.

Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are used to cre- ate a digital display in many devices. What are the ad- vantages of OLED displays over Liquid Crystal displays? ( USPC 2017) 1. OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic sub- strates. 2. Roll-up displays embedded in clothing can be made us- ing OLEDs. 3. Transparent displays are possible using OLEDs. Select the correct answer using the codes given below: (a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 only (c) 1, 2 and 3 (d) None of the above statements is correct Answer: C OLED TV is a television display technology based on the characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). OLED TV is a different technology than LED TV. The OLED display is based on an organic substance used as the semi- conductor material in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). OLEDs are ultrathin and light, they can be fabricated on flexible plastic or roll-up displays. Transparent displays are also possible. In general, OLEDs are more efficient than LCDs for display- ing dark images because black pixels consume little power for an emissive display, while LCDs are more efficient than OLEDs at displaying bright images. GS Paper 3 DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR RE- SOURCE ADEQUACY PLANNING FRAMEWORK FOR INDIA Syllabus: Infrastructure (Energy) Context: The Ministry of Power, in consultation with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), has released draft Guide- lines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for India. About the draft guidelines: ● The guidelines have been formulated under the Electricity (Amendment) Rules 2022. ● Under the new framework, the distribution compa- nies (DISCOM) will create a report detailing ○ The expected demand, ○ The rate of demand growth, ○ The current contracted capacity, and ○ The amount of power obtained from power exchanges. ● The resource adequacy exercise will be conducted with a 10-year planning horizon on a continuous ba- sis. ● The National Load Despatch Center (NLDC) is re- quired to release an annual short-term national re- source adequacy plan covering one year. The objective of the plan: ● To reliably fulfil the peak demand with the help of adequate supply of generation and demand re- sponse. ● To optimise the generation of electricity at the low- est possible cost while meeting the demand. This includes minimising overall system costs, such as - ○ Operational and maintenance expenses, ○ Fuel costs, ○ The costs associated with starting up and www.insightsonindia.com6 shutting down power-generating units, etc. ● To take into account various constraints related to power plant operations, such as - ○ Limits on ramping up or down generation, ○ Renewable purchase obligation (RPO) tar- gets, ○ Capacities for solar rooftop or distributed generation, etc. Significance: ● A set of guidelines to establish an institutional mechanism for resource adequacy, spanning from the national level down to the DISCOM. ● It will ensure the availability of resources at each level to meet the demand. ● It will help proactively assess the requirements for new generation capacities, energy storage, and oth- er flexible resources well in advance. Key challenges: ● The ongoing challenge of catering to the peak de- mand reliably is being faced by the utilities in India. ● Infrastructural and management challenges while sharing inter-state and inter-region power. ● Increasing share of variable renewable energy and higher frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change. Way ahead: ● Given the limited capacity and the learning curve as- sociated with the detailed resource adequacy plan, DISCOM be allowed a grace period of 2-3 years be- fore implementation of the same. ● Such a preparatory period would allow the discoms to explore the methodology, collect relevant data and put an internal institutional mechanism in place. Insta Links: Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022 GS Paper 3 THE OPEN MARKET SALE SCHEME Syllabus: Issues of PDS, Buffer Stocks and Food Secu- rity Context: The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has imposed quantity restrictions on states to procure two food grains (wheat and rice) through its Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). The issue related to the OMSS About OMSS Under the OMSS, the FCI sells (from time to time) surplus food grains (es- pecially wheat and rice) from the cen- tral pool in the open market to trad- ers, bulk consumers, and retail chains, at pre-determined prices. How? Through e-auctions, where open-mar- ket bidders can buy specified quanti- ties. OMSS and States States are also allowed to procure food grains (over and above what they get from the central pool to distribute to NFSA beneficiaries) through the OMSS without participating in the auctions. Objective of OMSS Ensure food security by enhancing the supply of food grains during the lean season, control inflation by moderat- ing the open market prices, especially in the deficit regions Revision of OMSS The Centre decided to restrict the quantity that a single bidder can pur- chase from 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) to 10-100 MT. The objective behind the re- vision To accommodate more small and marginal buyers, curb retail prices as allowing smaller bids should ideally break monopolies of bulk buyers, al- lowing more competitive bids by small buyers. Impact of Revi- sion on States The Centre stopped the sale of rice and wheat from the Central pool under the OMSS to State governments, also dis- allowing private bidders to sell their OMSS supplies to state governments. Steps Taken by States Considering alternative methods of obtaining wheat and rice. For example, TN is trying to purchase rice from gov- ernment agencies other than FCI. Allegations of States States such as Karnataka (which runs the Anna Bhagya scheme) and Tamil Nadu (which runs the universal PDS) have criticised the government for en- gaging in “politics” at the expense of marginalised beneficiaries of State wel- fare schemes. Centre’s reply Restrictions are imposed to curb infla- tion and regulate supply. The Centre is already distributing grains to 80 crore marginalised beneficiaries under the NFSA. www.insightsonindia.com7 FCI: ● It is a statutory body set up setup under the Food Corporation Act 1964, in order to fulfil the following objectives of the Food Policy: ○ Effective price support operations for safe- guarding the interests of the farmers. ○ Distribution of food grains throughout the country for a PDS. ○ Maintaining a satisfactory level of opera- tional and buffer stocks of foodgrains to en- sure National Food Security. ● It comes under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Government of India. ● Since its inception, FCI has contributed significantly to India’s success in transforming its food security system from one that was focused on crisis manage- ment to one that is stable.

(UPSC 2019) Content for Mains Enrichment SHARENTING West Bengal’s CID department has organised a campaign aimed at sensitising parents on the perils of Sharenting. What is Sharenting? It refers to the act of parents posting too many details about their children on social media. Risks associated with Sharenting are: •\t Detrimental for a child’s psychological growth •\t Increases risk of details being used by Cybercrimi- nals •\t Morphed photographs and ‘digital kidnapping’ Usage: The term and example can be used to highlight risks with the use of digital technologies NAMAKKAL DISTRICT (TAMIL NADU) Namakkal district (Tamil Nadu), India, has successfully ad- dressed its water scarcity challenges and achieved the sec- ond-best groundwater availability in the country. The district’s comprehensive approach involved community participation, rainwater harvesting, sustainable agriculture, efficient water management systems, and robust policies. Measures such as constructing rooftop collection systems, percolation tanks, and check dams were implemented to capture rainwater and replenish the groundwater table. Riv- er rejuvenation, canal desilting, and removal of encroach- ments were also undertaken. Community participation and awareness campaigns played a crucial role in fostering a water conservation culture. Usage: Namakkal’s success offers valuable lessons for India in coping with water crises and can be used in Questions re- lated to geography, Agriculture and Governance. USING PHYSICS TO UNDERSTAND HATE GROUPS ON THE INTERNET Scientists have developed a new approach to understand- ing online hate communities using mathematical equations commonly used to describe shock waves in fluids. The study found that online hate communities, or “anti-X” communities, grow rapidly due to fusion, where interested individuals or groups join them. The study’s findings have implications for identifying and combating hate speech, as tracking networks of known hate speech offenders can be more effective than focusing on in- dividual instances of hate speech. Usage: The finding can be used as an example of the use of technology to monitor can combat social crimes.

ENERGY TRANSITION INDEX Context: India has been ranked 67th globally on the World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, making it the only major economy with accelerating energy transition mo- mentum across all dimensions. •\t The top five countries on the list are Sweden, Den- mark, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland. The report highlighted India’s achievements in reducing energy and carbon intensity, achieving universal energy ac- cess, and managing electricity affordability. India also fared relatively well during the recent energy crisis due to a low share of natural gas in power generation and increased use of existing capacities. •\t Singapore was the only other major economy showing momentum in sustainability, energy secu- rity, and equity. GRAVITATIONAL VIBRATIONS Context: Scientists have found evidence suggesting the pres- ence of a continuous background of gravitational waves in the universe. About Gravitational Waves: •\t Gravitational waves are disturbances in the fabric of spacetime caused by the movement of large ob- jects, such as the collision of two black holes. •\t The waves were first detected in 2015, but this new research indicates that multiple gravitational waves constantly deform and reshape spacetime, influ- encing the motion of celestial bodies. Findings: Scientists have discovered a ‘background hum’ rumbling throughout the universe. It confirms the presence of low-frequency (long-wavelengths) gravitational waves, thought to be constantly rolling through space noise. India’s Giant Metre wave Radio Telescope (GMRT, Pune) was among the world’s six large telescopes that played a vital role in providing evidence. The other 5 are located in Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
