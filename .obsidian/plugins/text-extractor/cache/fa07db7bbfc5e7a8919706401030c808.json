Key findings of the 2023 report: Global Hunger Over 122 million people are facing hunger in the world since 2019 due to the pandemic and repeated weather shocks and conflicts, including the war in Ukraine. Nutritional Ac- cess ~2.4 billion individuals did not have consistent access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food in 2022. Child Malnutri- tion Child Malnutrition: In 2021, 22.3% (148.1 million) children were stunted (too short for their age), 6.8% (45 mil- lion) were wasted (too thin for their height), and 5.6% (37 million) were overweight. Urbanisation’s Impact on Diet As urbanisation accelerates, there is a noticeable increase in the consumption of processed and convenience foods, leading to a spike in overweight and obesity rates across urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Rural Depen- dence on Glob- al Markets Previously self-sustaining rural regions, especially in Africa and Asia, are now found to be increasingly dependent on national and global food markets. Challenges: ● While global hunger numbers have stalled between 2021 and 2022, there are many places in the world facing deepening food crises. ● Largely women and residents of rural areas did not have consistent access to nutritious, safe, and suffi- cient food in 2022. ● Child malnutrition is still alarmingly high. ● By 2050, it’s projected that 70% of the global popu- lation will reside in cities. Way ahead: ● This significant demographic shift necessitates a re- www.insightsonindia.com3 orientation of food systems to cater to these new urban populations and eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. ● The policy can strengthen intensification and increase productivity in farming close to small and intermediate cities and towns (SICTs). ● This will improve connectivity between farms and input and output markets, thus reducing the cost of access to markets and fostering farmers’ access to and use of modern inputs. A case study from India - The Role of urban proximity in agricultural intensification: ● Bangalore and its surroundings provide evidence of the essential role of SICTs in increasing the use of modern agri- cultural inputs in rural areas. ● Farmers located farther from Bangalore show a higher use of modern inputs due to the influence of the town of Doddaballapura - a City in Bangalore’s Rural district. Conclusion: The agrifood systems governance mechanisms and institutions must bridge sectoral and administrative borders and rely on subnational and local governments in order to implement these solutions. About the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report: ● It is an annual flagship report jointly prepared by the - ○ Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), ○ International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), ○ United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), ○ World Food Programme (WFP) and ○ World Health Organisation (WHO) ● It aims to inform on progress towards ending hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition and to pro- vide an in-depth analysis of key challenges for achieving this goal in the context of the SDG. ● The report targets a wide audience, including policy-makers, international organisations, academic institutions and the general public.

The visit coincides with 25 years of strategic partnerships with France. Significance of the PM’s visit to France: ● Increasing investment: The visit will help diversify France and European economic ties away from China ● Boosting regional security: The visit will help boost India’s comprehensive national power and help India stabilise the balance of power in Asia Current analysis of India-France relations: •\t Characteristics: The relationship between the two countries is characterized by strategic autonomy, independent foreign policies, and a shared vision of a multipolar world. •\t Security objectives prominent: Unlike Indo-German relations, which are focused on trade, India and France priori- tize security objectives. o France has helped India diversify its pool of arms suppliers beyond Russia and the US, especially when sanctions were imposed on India in the past. •\t Balancing China: The relationship aims to balance China’s influence in the Indian Ocean and have a shared concern about Chinese expansionism. •\t Multi-dimensional: The partnership between India and France has seen advancements through joint strategic vi- sions, logistic support agreements, and military exercises in recent times Dimensions of India-France Relations: Dimensions Description Examples Historical Rela- tions India and France had trade and cultural exchanges that can be traced back thousands of years. In the modern era, diplomatic relations between India and France were formally established in 1947 after India gained independence. Strategic Dialogue France became the first country to engage in a Strategic Dialogue with India following India’s nu- clear tests in 1998. Unlike other nations, France chose not to impose bilateral sanctions on India and instead showed a deeper understanding of India’s security concerns. Defence Coopera- tion France was the second largest de- fence supplier for India in 2017- 2021. •\t Induction of French Scorpene submarines and Rafale fighter jets •\t Joint military exercises like Varuna (navy), Garuda (air force), and Shakti (army). •\t Joint manufacturing: Tata Group tied up with Airbus to manufacture C-295 tactical transport aircraft in Vadodara, Gujarat.

Challenges in the relationship: India and France don’t have Free Trade Agreement, which limits the potential for increased trade and economic cooper- ation. Also, there is a trade imbalance in favour of France (France exporting more to India). Also, France has many times expressed concern on India’s stance at WTO, Climate summit and on India’s protection of intellectual property rights Conclusion: While military cooperation remains important, the Indo-French relationship could expand beyond arms sales. Initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and exploring minilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific could bring additional dimensions to their partnership.

(250 Words) GS Paper 3 TAX ON ONLINE GAMING: WHAT THE GST COUNCIL’S DECISION SAYS, ITS IMPLICATIONS Syllabus: Issues related to the Indian economy Context: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, in its 50th meeting, decided to levy a uniform 28% tax on full face value for online gaming, casinos and horse racing. Decision to levy 28% uniform tax on online gaming: ● Earlier, the ministerial panel had discussed the option of levying tax on gross gaming revenue or platform fee - the charge paid to avail the gaming services, but this did not find favour. ● The uniform levy of 28% tax will be applicable on - ○ The face value of the chips purchased in the case of casinos, ○ The full value of the bets placed with the bookmaker/totalisator in the case of horse racing, and www.insightsonindia.com6 ○ The full value of the bets placed in the case of online gaming. ● The government will bring in amendments to the GST-related laws to include online gaming and horse racing as taxable actionable claims - goods under the CGST Act, 2017. ● So far, lottery, betting, and gambling were classified as actionable claims. How will the tax work in real life? ● At present, most gaming companies were paying a tax of 18% applicable on the platform fees. ○ Let’s assume that the platform fee is 10%. So, for every Rs 100 deposited in the game, the platform makes Rs 10 and 18% GST on Rs 10 means that effectively, on every Rs 100, the GST is Rs 1.8. ● Under the new structure, a GST of 28% will be ap- plicable on the entire face value of the bet or the consideration paid, and not the platform fee. ○ Meaning that for every Rs 100 deposited, the GST on it will be Rs 28 - an increase of around 15.6 times. How big is the online gaming market in India? ● The industry grew at a CAGR of 38% between 2017- 2020, as opposed to 8% in China and 10% in the US. ● It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% to reach Rs 153 billion in revenue by 2024. ● India’s percentage of new paying users (NPUs) in gaming has been the fastest-growing in the world. ● Transaction-based games’ revenues grew 26% in In- dia, with the number of paying gamers increasing by 17% from 80 million in 2020 to 95 million in 2021. Who gets impacted? ● Online gaming is perhaps the only segment of the internet economy that has multiple highly profitable companies. ○ For example, Dream11 had a net profit of Rs 143 cr on revenues of Rs 3,841 crore in FY22. ● The decision has been applied indiscriminately to gaming and gambling platforms. ○ This includes companies that have spent years in lobbying efforts to create a distinc- tion between a game of skill and a game of chance/gambling platforms. How have online gaming companies reacted? ● The government’s move was “extremely unfortu- nate” as it will lead to “a nearly 1000% increase in taxation.” ● The GST Council’s decision is “unconstitutional, ir- rational, and egregious” and will wipe out the en- tire Indian gaming industry and lead to lakhs of job losses. ● The only people benefitting from this will be anti-na- tional illegal offshore platforms. The government’s intention: ● The moral question: The industry can’t be encour- aged to such an extent over essential goods and ser- vices. ● Gaming a speculative and addictive activity: ○ Every week there is a story of suicides be- cause of debts incurred due to online gam- ing. ○ The addiction has mainly impacted children and teenagers and along with higher taxes, the government needed to put in restric- tions on the basis of age, income etc. About Goods and Services Tax (GST): ● It is an indirect tax (not directly paid by customers to the government) that came into effect on July 1, 2017, as a result of the 101st Amendment to the In- dian Constitution. ● It is imposed on both manufacturers and sellers of goods, as well as suppliers of services. ● For tax collection, it is divided into five tax slabs - 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. About GST Council: ● It is an apex committee to modify, reconciles or make recommendations to the Union and the States on GST, like the goods and services that may be subject- ed or exempted from GST, model GST laws, etc. ● Article 279A of the Indian Constitution empowers the President of India to constitute a joint forum of the Centre and States called the GST Council.

Findings of the analysis: ● Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is an extremely potent air pollutant that can penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger a range of diseases including fatal ones. ● In 2022, the annual average of the most toxic air pollutant - ultrafine particulate matter (PM) 2.5, was as poor in rural India as in urban India (~46 mi- crogrammes against the national limit is 40 micro- grammes). ● The rural PM 2.5 pollution was found to be signifi- cantly high in Delhi (87 microgrammes) and states like Bihar, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan and West Bengal. ● The rural population suffers more than its urban counterpart when it comes to the length of losing life span due to exposure to the toxic pollutant. Steps taken - The National Clean Air Plan (NCAP): ● It was declared in 2019, with a tentative national lev- el target of 20-30% reduction of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration by 2024. ● So far it has released around Rs 9,000 crores mainly for 131 cities - called non-attainment ones - consis- tently going above the national air pollution limits. Takeaways from the findings: ● They put under scanner the Union government’s policy of only investing in selected urban areas of the country for controlling toxic air pollution. ● Most rural areas do not even have any on-ground pollution measuring mechanism; forget about com- bating it. Way ahead: ● Air pollution is a transboundary problem that knows no borders. ● There is an urgent need to track pollution levels and develop policies for rural regions. ● A larger network of high-spatial-resolution system- atic, robust and continuous air pollutants monitor- ing over the rural and non-urban regions is the need of the hour. ● Instead of selected cities, the air shade arrange- ment model needs to be pursued. Conclusion: The air pollution issue in the country in the re- cent decade would not be resolved unless the rural parts are taken into account. Therefore, the time is ripe for formulat- ing policy and action in rural India as well.

PHOSPHATE DISCOVERY IN NOR- WAY Context: A huge deposit of a valuable mineral called phos- phate, which can be used to power electric cars and solar panels, has been discovered in Norway. •\t There are up to 70 billion tonnes of phosphorus in the deposit, enough to meet demand for the next 50 years. About Phosphorous: •\t Phosphorus is a mineral which comes from phos- phate rock. •\t It is a finite resource which means there is only a certain amount in the world and it will eventually run out. •\t Around 90% of mined phosphate is used to pro- duce fertiliser for the agriculture industry. Previously, the largest amount of phosphate rock was found in Morocco’s western Sahara region, with approximately 50 billion tonnes. China (the largest phosphate producer in the world) and Egypt also have significant phosphate reserves. There are environmental concerns surrounding phosphate, including its role in causing algae blooms in waterways. The refining process for phosphorus extraction can be highly pol- luting. India: Phosphate rocks are also considered a significant and secondary resource of uranium. India is defi- cient in Apatite & Rock Phosphate availability. In the case of apatite, India is fully dependent upon imports, while the Rock Phosphate production is only from two states namely, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. AUDITONLINE Context: The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has launched the Ac- tion Taken Report (ATR) Module of AuditOnline through a virtual event. About AuditOnline: AuditOnline is open-source software developed by the Min- istry of Panchayati Raj as part of the Panchayat Enterprise Suite under the e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (as part of the Digital India Programme). Along with AuditOnline, the ministry also launched eGramSwaraj, another user-friendly accounting application. Aim: The application aims to promote transparency and ac- countability in the financial management of Panchayats. Advantages: •\t It enables online audits of Panchayat accounts. It al- lows for the generation of audit reports, documen- tation of observations, and monitoring of actions taken in response to audit findings. •\t The ATR Module will enable Panchayats to become more efficient, empowered, and corruption-free in managing funds. The government’s target is to Audit all Panchayat accounts to meet the criteria of the Fifteenth Finance Commission for subsequent grants. SAGAR SAMPARK Context: Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways (MoP- SW) has launched the ‘SAGAR SAMPARK’ Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS) to strengthen the mar- www.insightsonindia.com9 itime sector in India. What is Differential Global Navigation Satellite System? DGNSS is a technology that helps make GPS and other sat- ellite navigation systems more accurate. The major GPS sys- tem includes GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (Europe), BeiDou (China), NAVIC(India) How does it work? It works by using reference stations on the ground that send correction signals to GPS receivers. These correction signals help the receivers to correct any errors or inaccuracies in the satellite signals they receive. Advantages: •\t The implementation of DGNSS has improved GPS error correction accuracy from 5 to 10 meters to less than 5 meters for 100 Nautical Miles from the Indian coastlines. •\t It will also enhance the capabilities of the Director- ate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) (under MoPSW) in providing radio aids to marine navigation along the Indian coast. •\t Fulfilment of international navigation obligations of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and International Asso- ciation of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). Significance: The significance of DGNSS lies in its ability to provide more precise positioning information, and safe navigation, reduce the risk of accidents in port and harbour areas, and fulfil international navigation obligations. About IMO: The International Maritime Organization (agreement in 1948 and came into existence in 1958; HQ: London) is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping. About SOLAS: SOLAS Convention is related to the safety of merchant ships. It first came in 1914 after the famous Titanic inci- dent.
