It is immutable, universal and capable of growth. * Austin - “Law is the command of Sovereign.” * A.V. Dicey - In the words of A. V. Dicey, “Law is the reflection of Public opinion.” * Thearing - “the form of the guarantee of the conditions of life, of society, assured by State’s power of Constraints.” » Law can be defined « firstly - by its basis in nature, reason, religion or ethics, « secondly - by its sources like customs, precedent and legislation, « thirdly — by its effect on the life of the society, « fourthly — by the method of its formal expression or authoritative application, « fifthly — by the ends that it seeks to achieve.

It is superior to the ordinary law of the land because ordinary law derives its authority and force from the Constitutional Law. * Administrative Law : deals with the structure, powers and functions of the organs of administration; the limits of their power; the methods and procedure followed by them in exercise of their power; the methods by which their powers are controlled, including remedies available to a person against them when his/her rights are infringed by their operation. » Criminal Law: defines offences and prescribes punishment for them. * Private Law : This branch of law regulates and governs the relations of citizens with each other. It includes Personal Law e.g. Hindu Law and Muslim Law. Some other varieties of law * Natural or Moral Law : Natural Law is based upon the principle of right and wrong. It embodies the principles of Natural Justice. * Customary Law : Any rule of action which is actually observed by men/women when a Custom is firmly established, is enforced by the State as law because of its general approval by the people. * Substantive Law : deals with rights and obligations of the individuals against the State and prescribes the offences and punishments for the commission of such offences. For example, India Penal Code, 1860 contains 511 Sections on various offences and corresponding punishments for those offences. * Procedural Law : deals with the practice and procedure having its objective to facilitate the administration of justice. It is a process necessary to be undertaken for enforcement of the legal rights and liabilities of the litigating parties by a Court of Law. For example, the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 enshrines the procedures to be followed to inflict punishment on the wrongdoer. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRIMINAL LAW AND CIVIL LAW Civil law deals with the disputes between individuals, organizations etc., whereas Criminal Law is the body of law that deals with crime and the legal punishment for criminal offenses. In Civil law, the initiation of a case starts with the filing of a complaint by the aggrieved party against the wrongdoer, Whereas in Criminal Law, the case is filed y the Government against the accused. A Civil Litigation is less serious than a Criminal Litigation. Burden of proving the evidence in Civil Law lies on the plaintiff, whereas in Criminal Law it mostly lies on the State. In Civil Law, the punishment is given in terms of compensation whereby the wrongdoer reimburses the other party the amount of loss sustained by Elm as decided by the court, for example, in case of a breach of contract, the aggrieved party has to approach the court for damages, whereas in Criminal Law the guilty is punished by incarceration with or without fine, or in some rarest of the rare cases with death penalty. Broadly speaking, Civil Law aims at protecting individual interests against one another, whereas Criminal Law protects public interests against the wrongdoer. Civil Law includes disputes relating to property, contract, torts, family arrangements etc., whereas Criminal Law includes offences affecting human body and property and the corrcspondmg pumshmcnts for those offences. In Criminal cases more evidence is needed to find the accused at fault than to find the ‘defendant’ at fault in civil ones. In Criminal Law, question of probability does not arise, it has to be always certain, and in contrast civil case can be proved on a balance of probabilities.
