POLITY Year Marks/words Questions 2014 12.5/200 Instances of President's delay in commuting death sentences has come under public debate as denial of justice. Should there be a time limit for the President to accept/reject such petitions? 2014 12.5/200 Size of cabinet should be as big as government work justifies and as big as PM can manage as a team. How far is the efficacy of government then inversely related to size of the Cabinet? Discuss. 2015 12.5/200 Khap-panchayats have been in the news for functioning as extra – constitutional authorities, often delivering pronouncements amounting to human right violations. Discuss critically the actions taken by the legislative, executive and judiciary to set the things right in this regard. 2016 12.5/200 What is quasi judicial body? Explain with the help of concrete examples. 2017 10/150 Critically examine the Supreme Court’s judgement on ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014’ with reference to the appointment of judges of higher judiciary in India 2018 15/250 How far do you agree with the view that tribunals curtail the jurisdiction of ordinary courts? In view of the above, discuss the constitutional validity and competency of the tribunals in India. 2019 10/150 The Central Administration Tribunal which was established for redressal of grievances and complaints by or against central government employees, nowadays is exercising its powers as an independent judicial authority.” Explain. 2020 15/250 Judicial Legislation is antithetical to the doctrine of separation of powers as envisaged in the Indian Constitution. In this context justify the filing of large number of public interest petitions praying for issuing guidelines to executive authorities. ▪ Recruitment ▪ Contempt ▪ PIL ▪ Judicial Reforms ▪ Tribunals ▪ Cabinet Form of Government FOCUS AREAS What to prepare? ▪ Consolidated note on judiciary – independence as a part of basic structure, basics-appointment & removal, impact & issues with the independence, collegium structure. ▪ Judicial reforms – AIJS, Recommendations by committees, include issues of Pendency. ▪ Contempt of court & PIL. ▪ Forms of Government – features, merits & demerits of Parliament & Presidential forms. ▪ Role of Cabinet. ▪ Separation of Powers - 3 main branches of the State, namely the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary; each endowed with separate powers and functions, such that the operation of one is not subservient to the other. Thus each wing of the State is independent and autonomous in itself. ▪ Courts of the country not answerable to any other branch of the Government. ▪ Judiciary can serve as an unbiased third party in the adjudication of cases. ▪ Freedom in appointment of members of the higher judiciary. INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY ▪ During the era of the Emergency, wherein the State dictated the functioning of the Courts. ▪ Three senior judges were superseded in the appointment of Justice A.N.Ray as CJI ▪ Government returned the recommendation for elevation of Justice KM Joseph, Uttarakhand High Court to the Supreme Court ▪ Justice Ranjan Gogoi's appointment to the Rajya Sabha after several pro- government decisions by the Supreme Court SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHEREIN BIAS WAS REFLECTED? (To build context) JUDICIARY ▪ Independence of the Judiciary was declared as being part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution in SP Gupta vs. Union of India (1981), popularly known as the First Judges Case ▪ Reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of Supreme Court Advocates-on- Record vs. Union of India (1987),popularly known as the Second Judges Case. SINCE WHEN IS INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY PART OF BASIC STRUCTURE? (SC JUDGEMENT) JUDICIARY NOTES: ▪ Judges of the Supreme Court (SC) as well as High Court (HC) are appointed by the President of the country [SC Judges under Article 124 (2) and HC Judges under Article 217 (1)]. ▪ The Chief Justice of India (CJI) is appointed by the President, in consultation with judges of the SC as well as the HCs. However, as per convention, usually, the senior most judge of the SC is appointed as theCJI. ▪ The Chief Justice of a HC is appointed by the President, in consultation with the CJI and the Governor of the state.In HCs too,convention dictates that the senior most judge of the HC is appointed as the Chief Justice. ▪ The process for appointment of judges of the SC was streamlined in the Third Judges Case of 1998, which established a Collegium, consisting of the 4 senior most judges of the Supreme Court excluding theCJI. ▪ The Collegium recommends names to the President, who then appoints the recommended persons as judgesof the SC. ▪ Judges of the H C are appointed by the President on the basis of recommendations made by a Collegium consisting of 2 of the senior most judges of the SC excluding the CJI and in consultation with the Chief Justice of the respective HC. APPOINTMENT & REMOVAL JUDICIARY ▪ For SC - ▪ Must be a citizen of India; and ▪ Judge of a High Court for 5 years; or ▪ 10 years' experience as a practicing advocate of a HC; or ▪ Distinguished jurist as per the President ▪ For HC - ▪ Must be a citizen of India; and ▪ Holding any judicial office for 10 years; or ▪ 10 years' experience as a practicing advocate of a HC. ▪ The current process reflects plurality and concurrence in the system of appointment of judges. ▪ Current Affairs: The Parliament enacted the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019, pursuant to which the number of SC judges increased from 31 to 34. QUALIFICATIONS ▪ Judges of the SC as well as the HC are removed by President upon the impeachment of the judge by the Parliament. ▪ The Parliament may remove (not impeach) a sitting judge on grounds of proved misbehaviour and incapacity. ▪ The Judges Enquiry Act,1968 provides the detailed procedure for removal of judges. ▪ A judge is removed by the Parliament by way of a motion passed by a special majority of the members of the House, i.e. two-thirds majority of members present and voting such that the said number is greater than half of the total strength of the House. REMOVAL OF JUDGES JUDICIARY ▪ The current system of appointment of judges is primarily controlled by the Judiciary itself. ▪ The Collegium system ensures that senior members of the Higher Judiciary are directly involved in the appointment of Judges to the Higher Judiciary with minimal to no interference from the Legislature or the Executive. ▪ The recommendations of the Collegium are customarily accepted by the President. This ensures that the Independence of the Judiciary remains sacrosanct. ▪ However, given that the President always acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Government does play a role in the appointment of Judges. [e.g. of when recommendation not followed - Justice KM Joseph of Uttarakhand High Court, Justice Krishna Bhat (sessions judge)] ▪ Process of removal of judges rests entirely with the Parliament. This acts a measure for checks and balances within the wings of the State. IMPACT OF APPOINTMENTS AND REMOVALS ON INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY? JUDICIARY ▪ Process of appointment and removal of the Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts is reflective of the separation of powers between the three wings of State ▪ System of inter se checks and balances between wings of Government in place within the constitutional machinery of the country,where no one wing of the State becomes vestedwith ultimate power. WHY DOES INDIA HAVE SUCH A PROCESS? ▪ Primary problem - Judiciary appoints itself - possibility of backdoor politics, ▪ lack of transparency,objectivity and accountability. ▪ lack of detailed and specific guidelines for appointment of judges further ▪ process for impeachment of judges is extremely detailed and tedious, therefore, judicial appointmentsare rarely challenged. ▪ [hollow independence of the judiciary. Although the President, as the Head of State, appoints the judges, the President is, in reality, bound by the recommendation of the Council of Ministers, or the elected representatives. Consequently, the Government/Executive is indirectly involved in the appointment of judges,and as a result,in the functioning of the Judiciary] Unsure if this is a legitimate problem. PRIMARY PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT PROCESS? JUDICIARY ▪ Process of appointment of judges was sought to be amended by the introduction of the National Judicial Appointment Commission Act,2014. ▪ The NJAC Act sought to address the criticisms that the Judiciary appointed itself, which led to lack of transparency and objectivity in the appointment process. ▪ NJAC Act was struck down by the SC in the year 2015: ▪ for failure to follow the due procedure laid down to enact such a statute,and ▪ on account of the NJAC Act violating the Independence of the Judiciary, and resultantly the Basic Structure of the Constitution. ▪ Simultaneously, the SC revived the Collegium System and subsequently directed the Government to supplement the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of Judges of SC and HC taking into account factors like eligibility, transparency in the appointment process, establishment of Secretariat and Complaint mechanism in consultation with the SC C ollegium/CJI. ▪ Reforms to the Collegium System - such as online disclosure of meetings of the collegium. ▪ Office of CJI brought under the scope of the RTI Act,by SC, which held that Office of CJI is a 'public authority'. STEPS TAKEN SO FAR TO BETTER THE PROCESS (NJAC, Collegium reforms) JUDICIARY ▪ 14th Law Commission Report (LCR) suggested that every appointment to the High Court and the Supreme Court should be made with the concurrence of the CJI. ▪ 80th LCR suggested that the CJI consult three senior most colleagues during appointments ▪ 121st LCR recommended the constitution of National Judicial Commission ▪ High Courts Arrears Committee in the 1970s suggested that exercise for filling the vacancy must start well in advance so that the selection can be finalized by the time the vacancy occurs. It recommended that if the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not dealt with within one month from the date of its receipt, the State Government must be deemed to have accepted the recommendation and action must be taken by the Central Government for expeditious disposal of the proposal. ▪ The N C R WC recommended the setting up of NJC with detailed suggestions as to composition, procedure of appointment and even removal of judges. RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMITTEES ETC. AS POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS? JUDICIARY ▪ Contempt of Court refers to the offence of showing disrespect to the dignity or authority of a court. ▪ As a concept, Contempt of court proposes to protect judicial institutions from motivated attacks and unwarrantedcriticism. ▪ Used as a legal mechanism to punish those who lower its authority, in order to safeguard the interests of the public and public confidence in the administration of justice. ▪ The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their contempt powers from the Constitution (contempt of court is one of the restrictions on freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(2)) ▪ Article 129 of the Constitution conferred on the Supreme Court the power to punish contempt of itself. ▪ Article 215 conferred a corresponding power on the High Courts. ▪ The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (“the Act”), gives statutory backing to the idea. The Act was significantly amended by the 2006 Amendment to the Act. WHAT IS THE CONTEMPT OF COURT? JUDICIARY ▪ The Act specifies that the Supreme Court as well as the High Courts have the power to try and punish the offence of contempt. ▪ High Courts also have the power to punish acts of contempt against courts subordinate tothem. ▪ In addition to these courts,certain administrative tribunals also have been given the power to punish for contempt,in their governing statutes ▪ The Contempt of Court Act,1971,outlines the procedure in relation to investigation and punishment forcontempt. ▪ According to the Act,contempt is divided into civil and criminal contempt. THE CONTEMPT OF COURTS ACT, 1971 ▪ The Act provides that a charge of contempt may be brought against a judge,magistrate or any other person acting judicially, for contempt of her own court or any other court in a manner similar to any other individual. The provisions of the Act shall be applicable in the same manner to such persons, as any other individual JUDICIARY *‘Scandalising the Court’ broadly refers to statements orpublications which have the effect of undermining public confidence in the judiciary. The punishment for contempt of court is simple imprisonment for a term up to six months and/or a fine of up to ₹2,000. Why inthe News? ▪ Contempt of Court has recently been in the news for the infamous case against Advocate Prashant Bhushan for two of his tweets,regarding the functioning of the Apex Court as well as the Chief Justice of India (Justice Bobade), which have held to be in contempt by the Supreme Court. Prashant Bhushan was fined Re.1 as a penalty for the contempt. JUDICIARY ▪ What is not contempt of court? ▪ Fair and accurate reporting of judicial proceedings. ▪ Fair criticism on the merits of a judicial order after a case is heard and disposed of. ▪ Is truth a defence against a contempt charge? ▪ Initially Truth not a defence against a contempt charge. ▪ Amendment to the Contempt of Court Act in 2006 introduced truth as a valid defence, if it was in public interest and was invoked in a bona fide manner. SPECIFIC POINTS JUDICIARY ▪ Reduction in respect to the Judiciary: Amendment to the definition of contempt may reduce the overall impact of the law and lessen the respect that people have for courts and their authority and functioning. ▪ Constitutional Source of Contempt Power: Supreme Court and High Courts derive their contempt powers from the Constitution.The Contempt of Court Act,1971,Act only outlines the procedure in relation to investigation and punishment for contempt.Therefore,deletion of the offence from the Act will not impact the inherent constitutional powers of the superior courts to punish anyonefor its contempt. ▪ Impact on Subordinate Courts: The Contempt of Court Act allows High Courts to punish for contempt of subordinate courts. Thus, if the definition of contempt is removed, subordinate courts will suffer as there will be no remedy to address cases of their contempt.The Court reject that Law or any of its parts which is found to be unconstitutional or against the constitution. ▪ Ambiguity: Amending the definition of contempt will lead to ambiguity;superior courts will exercise power of contempt under the constitution and may give multiple definitions and interpretations to what constitutes contempt. Retaining the definition fulfils the purpose of clarity according to thecommission. ▪ Adequate Safeguards: The Law Commission of India noted that there are several safeguards built into the Act to protect against its misuse.For instance, the Act contains provisions which lay down cases that do not amount to contempt and cases where contempt is not punishable. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR JUDICIARY ▪ Against Civil Liberties: Contempt law in conflict with freedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right. ▪ Use of contempt law by judiciary causes chilling effect on exercise of freedom of speech. ▪ Former Justice of Supreme Court, V.R. Krishna Iyer, famously termed the law of contempt as “having a vague and wandering jurisdiction, with uncertain boundaries; contempt law, regardless of the public good, may unwittingly trample upon civil liberties”. ▪ Wide Scope of Contempt:The definition of criminal contempt in India is extremely wide, and can be easily invoked. Courts may also initiate proceedings suo motu. ▪ Truth and Good Faith as Defences are seldom entertained,although included as defences under the Contempt of CourtsAct. ▪ International Disuse: Contempt of court has practically become obsolete in foreign democracies, with various jurisdictions recognising it is an archaic law. ▪ England abolished the offence of“scandalizing the court” in 2013. ▪ Canada ties its test for contempt to real,substantial and immediate dangers to the administration. ▪ American courts also no longer use the law of contempt in response to comments on judges or legal matters. ARGUMENTS AGAINST CONTEMPT OF COURT JUDICIARY The Law Commission of India looked into the issue of Contempt and recommended that the provision for contempt of courts be retained. However, it also recommended the definition of contempt in the Contempt of Court Act should be restricted to civil contempt,i.e.,wilful disobedience of judgments of the court. CONCLUSION JUDICIARY ▪ What is Public Interest Litigation? ▪ Refers to litigation undertaken for protection of public interest. ▪ Not necessarily introduced by the aggrieved party but by any private party or even by the Court suo motu. ▪ Power to approach courts given to the general public through judicial activism. ▪ Not a creation of statute,but judicial interpretation of rights of citizens. ▪ PIL in the Indian context was defined by Supreme Court in the case of SP Gupta v.Union of India (1981) [First Judges Case] heralded by Justice P.N.Bhagawati. ▪ Justice P.N.Bhagwati and JusticeV.R.Krishna Iyer pioneered in admitting PILs in courts in the 1980s. ▪ Writ with specification that the matter is related to the general well-being of the public instead of a particular litigant. ▪ PIL moved to quash the PM CARES fund during period of COVID-19 pandemic (dismissed on grounds of being ‘misconceived’). PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION JUDICIARY ▪ Any citizen can file a public case by filing a petition: ▪ Under Art.32 of the Indian Constitution,in the Supreme Court. ▪ Under Art.226 of the Indian Constitution,in the High Court ▪ Under S.133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in the Court of Magistrate. ▪ The Court must be satisfied that the writ petition fulfills some basic needs for PIL. ▪ Further,the Court can treat even a letter as a writ petition and take action upon it so long as: ▪ the letter is addressed by an aggrieved person; or ▪ a public spirited individual;or ▪ a social action group for enforcement of the constitutional or the legal rights of a person in custody or of a class or group of persons who by reason of poverty, disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position find it difficult to approach the court for redress. ▪ A PIL can be filed against public bodies and authorities, but not against private parties. HOW CAN A PIL BE INITIATED? JUDICIARY SUBJECT MATTERS ENTERTAINED IN PILS INCLUDE: ▪ Bonded Labour matters; ▪ Neglected Children; ▪ Exploitation of casualworkers; ▪ Non-payment of minimum wages; ▪ Atrocities towards women; ▪ Environmental pollution and disturbance of ecological balance; ▪ Food adulteration; ▪ Maintenance of heritage andculture. ▪ Hussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar (Considered first PIL case in India - focused on the inhuman conditions of prisons and under trial prisoners). ▪ M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (Several cases for environment preservation were initiated byway of PILs). ▪ Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (The Supreme Court laid down guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment of women at the workplace, which was followed for nearly 16 years before the enactment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013). ▪ Parmanand Katara v. Union of India (The Supreme Court held in this case that it is a paramount obligation of every member of medical profession to give medical aid to every injured citizen as soon as possible without waiting for any procedural formalities). LANDMARK PIL CASES JUDICIARY ▪ Accessible legal redressal for all, especially poor and marginalised, balance of law and justice. ▪ Allows access to justice for economically challenged sections, and provides a platform for them to advocate for their rights. ▪ Implements judicial reviewconcept. ▪ Ensures judicial monitoring of state institutions (transparency, inter se checks and balances between wings of the government). ▪ Democratizes justice;protects human rights. ▪ Raises awareness on important issues. ▪ Allows judicial monitoring of state institutions ADVANTAGES OF PIL ▪ Problem of competing rights, wherein the recognition or grant of rights to one section of the society leads to disadvantage to another section of marginalized population (E.g. shutting down of polluting industries leads to loss of employment for daily wagers dependent on that industry). ▪ Frivolous cases can be filed by parties with vested interest without heavy court fees, leading to the time and attention of the Court being diverted from genuine and crucial matters. ▪ Potential for judicial overreach, which violates the doctrine of separation of powers. ▪ Inordinate delays in the disposal of PIL cases. DISADVANTAGES OF PIL JUDICIARY What is a Tribunal? ▪ A quasi-judicial institution established to deal with issues in relation to administrative or tax- relateddisputes. ▪ It performs a number of functions like adjudicating disputes, determining rights between contesting parties, making an administrative decision, reviewing an existing administrative decision and so forth. TRIBUNALS Need of tribunals: ▪ To overcome the problem of pendency in Courts and reduce workload of courts. ▪ To expedite decisions and to provide a forum which would be manned by lawyers and experts in the areas falling under the jurisdiction of the tribunal. ▪ To perform specialised roles in various fields such as hearing disputes related to the environment, armed forces,tax and administrative issues. ▪ Tribunals were not part of the original Constitution; they were incorporated into the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. JUDICIARY Article 323A Article 323B Deals with Administrative tribunals Deals with tribunals for other matters- NGT, COMPAT, SAT Adjudication of disputes in following matters: • Taxation • Foreign Exchange, import-export • Industries and labor • Land reforms • Ceiling on urban property • Elections to Parliament and State Legislature • Rent and tenancy rights Can be established only by the Parliament Can be established by Parliament or State Legislature Only one at Centre and one for each State (for two/more States) There can be hierarchy of tribunals CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS JUDICIARY TRIBUNALS IN INDIA JUDICIARY ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TRIBUNALS Advantages Disadvantages Offers flexibility when compared to ordinary courts that have to adhere to strict procedures Goes against the spirit of Rule of Law Cheap and speedy justice Procedure followed is simple and easy to understand Uniform code of procedure for civil and criminal cases, however, administrative tribunals have no uniformity Offer relief to ordinary courts that are already overburdened Sometimes ha sled by subject matter experts, who have no experience of judicial proceedings ▪ Lack of autonomy in the appointment and funding of tribunals- In the case of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India & Ors. (1997), the SupremeCourt held that appeals against orders of a tribunal could be made in the High Court, defeating the purpose of reducing the burden of the normal courts. ▪ Lack of appropriate infrastructure for the tribunals to function efficiently. ▪ Appointment of retired judges as chairpersons to tribunals results in potential show of favouritism towards certain in order to ensure appointment post- retirement. ▪ Influence of the executive and lack of autonomy of tribunals CHALLENGES OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS JUDICIARY CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL (CAT) • Setup in 1985, Principal bench at Delhi • Original jurisdiction- in relation to recruitment and all service matters of public servants covered by it. Extends to AIS, civil posts under the Centre and civilian employees of defence services • Composition- Chairman + 65 members • They hold office for a term of 5 years or until they attain 65 years of age (62, for Chairman) • Appointments are made with the final approval of Appointments Committee of Cabinet • Flexible in approach as they are guided by the Principles of Natural Justice • Originally, appeals against orders could only be made to the SC. But, 1997 judgement- SC declared the restriction on HCs unconstitutional • Lack of autonomy especially in terms of appointment • The process of appeals defeats the whole purpose of reducing burden of the superior courts. • The tribunals are mainly chaired by the retired judges who are appointed by the government (conflict of interest). • Lack of adequate infrastructure to work smoothly and perform the functions originally envisioned. • There is a lack of understanding of the staffing requirements in tribunals. CHALLENGES Conclusion: In the interest of better justice delivery, their traditional structures and methods of functioning can be reformed. Tribunals themselves are better positioned to gauge their own administrative requirements. Therefore, it seems viable to provide power to tribunals. JUDICIARY • Military tribunal established under the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007. • Settles disputes with respect to the commission, emoluments, appointments and service conditions of personnel in the armed forces. • Its principal bench is in New Delhi. It also has ten regional benches OTHER TRIBUNALS ▪ Set up in 1941,as the first experiment in tribunalization in the history of India. ▪ ITAT deals with appeals under the direct taxes acts. ▪ Second appellate authority under the direct taxes and first independent forum in its appellate hierarchy. ▪ Orders passed by the ITAT can be appealed only on the basis of a substantial question of law before the respective High Court. ▪ Currently, the tribunal has 63 Benches. INCOME TAX APPELLATE TRIBUNAL (ITAT)ARMED FORCES TRIBUNAL JUDICIARY • Established in 2010 for effective and expeditious disposal of cases that are related to protection and conservation of the environment,forests and other natural resources. • Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial question relating to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment). • ‘Special’because India is the third country following Australia and New Zealand to have such a system. • Principal Bench in New Delhi and regional benches in Pune (West),Bhopal (Central),Chennai (South) and Kolkata(East). Landmark cases: • Betty C. Alvares vs.The State of Goa and Ors.- Even a Foreign National Can Approach the NGT • Almitra H.Patel & Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors.- Complete prohibition on open burning of waste on lands • Manoj MisraVs. Delhi Development Authority & Ors.– The Art of Living Foundation was penalized INR 5 Crores for damaging theYamuna plains during its conduct of theWorld Culture Festival. Challenges: • Two important acts -Wildlife (Protection) Act,1972 and Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act,2006 have been left out of NGT’s purview,which restricts the jurisdiction of NGT and hampers functioning. • Lack of clarity on the position of the NGT in relation to High Courts results in NGT decisions being challenged in various High Courts under Article 226 under the argument that High Courts are superior to the NGT, despite the NGT Act providing for appeals directly to the Supreme Court. • The decisions of the NGT are not fully complied with by stakeholders or the government,under the pretext of an unfeasible timeframe. • The lack of human and financial resources has led to high pendency of cases - which undermines NGT’s very objective of disposal of appeals within 6 months. NATIONAL GREEN TRIBUNAL JUDICIARY JUDICIARY State of Pendency in Indian Judiciary ▪ Approx. 3.5 crore cases pending in the judicial system (approx.88% of pending cases in lower judiciary, i.e.district and subordinate courts). ▪ More than 64% of all cases are pending for more than 1 year. ▪ The Economic Survey of 2019-2020 dedicated a separate chapter to the pendency of tax cases and revenue cases. ▪ Ease of Doing Business Report of the World Bank for 2018 and 2019 shows that the time taken to decide a case has remained static at 1,445 days. ▪ Consistent increase in pendency of cases in the last decade, with the highest number of cases pending in the state of Uttar Pradesh. ▪ Number of under-trials in prison is more than double that of convicts. ▪ Until 2020, the Supreme Court has seen a marginal increase in the number of pending cases. Between 2 January and 1 October, pendency has increased by 3,287 cases, from 58,859 to 63,146 cases. PENDENCY JUDICIARY ▪ Increased awareness of rights of common man due to socio-economic advances, which has also improved capacityto sue. ▪ New mechanisms that have simplified the process of judicial cognizance (E.g.:Public Interest Litigation) and new rights granted to the general public (E.g.: Right to Information), which increases awareness and emboldens litigants. ▪ Vacancies in Judicial posts and lack of sufficient judges, especially in lower judiciary. ▪ Insufficient number ofcourts. ▪ Increased litigation from the Government (e.g.tax and revenue cases). ▪ Current Affairs POI -Vodafone tax case that has continued and fresh suits filed by the Government, despite a Supreme Court judgement in the matter. ▪ Poor judicial quality in lower courts,dissatisfaction amongst litigants. ▪ Archaic/Vague Laws requiring interpretation from higher judiciary. ▪ Lack of strict timelines for strict proceedings. ▪ Repeated adjournments (Tareekh pe tareekh!). REASONS OF PENDENCY JUDICIARY ▪ Denies the poor man and under-trial prisoners their due justice. ▪ Economic reforms - only on paper without speedier justice system. ▪ Foreign investors hesitate to invest in India due to the delayed delivery of justice,which affects the success of programs like ‘Make in India’. ▪ Judiciary becomes overburdened; loses efficacy and efficiency. ▪ Erodes social infrastructure. ▪ Overcrowding ofprisons. ▪ Financial drain of the coffers of the State;judicial delays cost India an estimated 1.5% of its GDP annually. ▪ High time,energy and money costs for litigant/common man,resulting in loss of the common man’s faith in the justice system. CONSEQUENCES OF PENDENCY JUDICIARY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS PENDENCY ▪ Introduce time limits for all cases and having a definite time frame to dispose the cases by setting annual targets, and action plans for the subordinate judiciary and the High Courts (E.g. Introduction of rigid time frames for filing of pleadings in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, by way of Amendment to the Civil Procedure Code.) ▪ Increase in number of judges (E.g., The increase in the number of Supreme Court judges from 31 to 34 in 2019.) ▪ Decentralize working of the Supreme Court by introducing Regional Benches (this recommendation was also put forth by the Law Commission.) ▪ Increase working hours of courts. ▪ Increase functioning and efficiency of ADR; effective utilization of mechanisms such as Lok Adalats and Gram Nyayalayas. ▪ Establishment of Tribunals, Fast Track Courts and Special Courts to dispense important cases at the earliest. ▪ Introduction of the All-India Judicial Services (AIJS) for appointment of members to the lower judiciary.(The Union Government plans to introduce a bill for implementation of the AIJS after consultation with the higher judiciary) ▪ Better case and court management. ▪ Revamping of National Judicial Data Grid. JUDICIARY Use of Information technology (IT) solutions: • Digitization of court registry. • E-filing of suits across courts. • Video conferencing hearings. • Digitization of court database, use of ERP tools for database management. • Real time updates of case status, cause list etc. • (Supreme Court and most High Courts as well as several tribunals and registries have effectively engaged IT solutions for conduct of court proceedings during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic related lockdown.) ▪ Malimath Committee Report ▪ Increase in number of courts and judges. ▪ Reduction in period of vacations for the Courts by 21 days. ▪ ‘Arrears Eradication Scheme’ – pending cases prioritized and settled through Lok Adalats; no adjournment allowed. JUDICIARY ▪ Centre has introduced a mobile application ‘JustIS’ for efficient court management by judges. (App developed by the National Informatics Centre.) ▪ Introduction of“fast-track” courts,jail-adalats (“prison courts”),and plea-bargaining. ▪ Campaign Mode to reduce pendency through Pendency Reduction Campaign in second half of the year2011. ▪ Resolution aimed at prioritization of disposal of cases through Mission Mode was passed in April 2016. ▪ The Supreme Court, in the case of Hussain & Anr. v. Union of India (2017), issued timelines for completion of criminal trials and appeals and directed High Courts to plan and monitor the speed oftrials. ▪ The Supreme Court has, in recent times, given strict guidelines to not allow pleas for unnecessary or groundless adjournments, used as dilatory tactics. MEASURES IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE PENDENCY JUDICIARY ▪ What is All India Judicial Services (AIJS) - an Overview ▪ AIJS first proposed by the 14th Report of the Law Commission of India in 1958. ▪ The recommendation aimed at creating a centralised cadre of District Judges that would draw better talent. ▪ Creation of AIJS was favoured by the Chief Justices conferences in 1961,1963,and 1965. ▪ The Law Commissions in its several reports had suggested the creation of the service. ▪ Proposal floated by the government in the year 2012, but the draft bill was abandoned due to opposition from High Courts, claiming violation of their rights. ▪ At present, various high courts and state service commissions hold exams to recruit judicial officers. ▪ AIJS in the news ▪ Draft bill to introduce AIJS prepared by the Government, to be introduced to the Union Cabinet after seeking the views of the Higher Judiciary ALL INDIA JUDICIAL SERVICES JUDICIARY ▪ Recruitment in lower judiciary happens state-wise resulting in lower standard of district court judges. ▪ Many judicial posts remain vacant despite an extraordinarily high number of pending cases. ▪ To standardise process of appointments to lower judiciary. ▪ To create a carder of dedicated,professional judicial officers. WHY IT IS REQUIRED? ▪ The idea of judicial service was introduced as early as in the 1950s. ▪ The provision of AIJS was also included in Article 312 of the Constitution through the 42ndamendment in 1976. ▪ NITI Aayog, in its report,‘Strategy for New India@75’, also mooted the creation of an All India Judicial Service (AIJS) for making appointments to the lower judiciary. WHO RECOMMENDED AIJS? JUDICIARY ▪ Efficiency and efficacy of judiciary would be increased. ▪ Transparent and efficient method of recruitment would be followed. ▪ The issue of pendency and issue of delay of cases would be solved to a great extent. ▪ Corruption, nepotism etc.would be strongly dealt with. ▪ Best legal talent across the country would be selected on the basis of merit. ▪ Better qualified judges in the lower judiciary would translate into more experienced judges in the higher judiciary. ▪ Public faith in the judiciary would be restored. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF AIJS ▪ Issue of differences in local laws of each state. ▪ Local languages and dialects would pose problems in a hyper technical field such as law. ▪ May lead to conflict between Centre & State as the power to recruit judicial officers so far rests with thestates. ▪ Legal Education in India is mismanaged. Except for a few well reputed law schools across the country,legal education is not prioritised. ▪ It will be difficult for the less privileged to enter the profession. ▪ Currently, the judges of subordinate courts are appointed by the governor in consultation with the High Court which will not be so if AIJS is implemented.This may be construed as a violation of the Independence of Judiciary as some other body will have a control in appointments. ▪ There is no substantial improvement in the existing efficacy of the procedure for filling the vacancy inthe judiciary. ARGUMENTS AGAINST AIJS JUDICIARY ▪ Although AIJS proposes to solve the problem of judicial vacancies, it would be crucial to first conduct a detailed investigation into the reasons for judicial vacancies in poorly performing states so as to structure AIJS in a manner to solve the inherent issues. ▪ Moreover, after the selection of candidates, a Judicial service officer can be provided sufficient training to handle the job, similar to the training imparted to candidates of IAS, IPS, IFS and other civil services, in order to resolve state-specific issues. A meritocratic judiciary is the need of the hour which is possible with a competitive recruitment process. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the AIJS would depend on its potential to efficiently address existing issues and impartiality in its implementation. CONCLUSION JUDICIARY Breaking down Basics ▪ Democratic System of governance is broken down into two basic forms: Parliamentary and Presidential forms. ▪ Systems with features of both forms also exist as hybrids. ▪ Democratic governments can be classified on the basis of the relationship between the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary,and the extent of separation of powers between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. ▪ Accountability of the Executive to the Legislature distinctly differentiates between the two basic forms. FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ▪ Form of governance in which a head of government leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. ▪ The Head of State is also the designated Head of Government – and is called the President. ▪ Executive is constitutionally independent of Legislature. ▪ Presidentialism is the dominant form of governance in mainland Americas – 19 out of 22 sovereign states – and is also widespread in Central Asia, Central and Southern West Africa.The only republics to follow this system in Europe are Belarus and Cyprus. ▪ The United States of America is the perfect example of Presidential governance. ▪ Each of the three branches – judiciary, executive and legislative – are independent of the others,deriving authority from the constitution. WHAT IS PRESIDENTIAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT? FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ▪ Separation of Powers:Executive and Legislature are at par.Neither President nor Cabinet members are part of/responsible to Legislature. ▪ System of Checks and Balances exists in the following forms – ▪ Executive in form of the President has Veto power over Legislative. ▪ Legislature is enabled with power to remove President by the process of impeachment. ▪ Judiciary – Supreme Court – has the power to declare the Legislature’s laws, and Presidents orders as unconstitutional. ▪ Single Executive:Unlike Parliamentary form,here the President is the real Head of State as well as Head of Government.There is no concept of a titular/nominal Head. ▪ Prominent Position:President occupies a pre-eminent position in the Government and has subordinate members of Cabinet whose advice he may accept or reject. ▪ Fixed Term: Removal before completion of the President’s fixed term is possible only through impeachment on the basis of constitutional violation. FEATURES OF PRESIDENTIAL FORM OF GOVERNANCE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT Merits Demerits Separation of Powers ensures each organ its individual liberty giving no single organ superior powers. Risk of being a despotic nature of governance, as President is not answerable to the Legislature. Presidential system is speedy and responsive in emerging situations. Since Cabinet secretaries are appointed directly by the President, personal loyalty and ties play an important role. Prompt decisions can be taken because the President is not constrained by directions of the Cabinet orLegislature. Expertise and merit might take a backseat in case of such appointments Efficient administration without influence of political parties, as Presidency is notdependent on majority support from the legislature. Conflict between Executive and Legislature in case opposition dominates the latter. This can lead to hampering of publicinterest. Impeachment is a complex and time-consuming procedure which can be resorted to only in emergency situations. MERITS & DEMERITS OF PRESIDENTIAL FORM FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ▪ The form wherein executive is selected from among the members of the legislature and is responsible to the legislature is called Parliamentary government. ▪ A.k.a.Cabinet form of Government as the real executive power lies with the Cabinet. ▪ Executive is held accountable by Legislature. Due to this feature it is also called “Responsible Government”. ▪ India’s current Parliamentary form of governance is an inheritance from its colonial past. ▪ Parliamentary governments can either be constitutional monarchies (United Kingdom etc.) or parliamentaryrepublics (Italy, Germany, Irelandetc.) ▪ Parliamentarianism is the most common form of governance in Europe, in the Caribbean etc. and throughout the world, usually in former colonies of the British Empire. ▪ Westminster model of Parliamentary governance – a system incorporating three arms of government - the executive, the legislature and an independent judiciary – is found in most former colonies including India. WHAT IS PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF GOVERNMENT? FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ▪ Houses of Parliament: Parliamentary governments can be either bicameral (two houses of parliament) or unicameral; most parliamentary democracies follow bicameral legislature. ▪ Accountability of Executive:The executive – Prime Minister and ministers – emerge from Legislature (Parliament) and are therefore always answerable to the Legislative. ▪ Dual Executive:There is a nominal,or a titularexecutive, the President (or monarch etc.) – Head of State – and a real executive,the Prime Minister – Head of Government. ▪ The Prime Minster is the acknowledged head of the Parliamentary system. ▪ Oath of Secrecy:Whatever is discussed in the cabinet stays in the cabinet.Divulsion of information can cost a Cabinet Minster his/her seat. FEATURES OF PARLIAMENTARY FORM ▪ The Parliamentary system is dealt with under Article 74 and Article 75 when it comes to Centre. ▪ The State Parliamentary system is highlighted under the articles 163 and 164. ▪ In our Parliamentary system, the Prime Minister is the senior-most minister of cabinet of the executive. ▪ Members of Cabinet are selected by the PM and may be dismissed by him. ▪ Executive powers are exercised by Union Council of Minister while the Union Cabinet,a smaller body,is the supreme body of executive powers: According to Article 75,Union Cabinet members are the Prime Minister and ministers of the rank of cabinetminister. ▪ Chief differences from the British Parliamentary system which we emulated – ▪ Appointed Speaker formally resigns from previous party unlike India where party membership continues and yet the Speaker must remain unbiased. ▪ Absence of a‘shadow cabinet’to monitor and criticize the majority government,keep them in check. FORMS OF GOVERNMENT Merits Demerits Less delay in passing laws etc, as Executive comes from Legislative. Unclear separation of powers – Legislators forced to follow party whip especially in case of a large majority in theHouse. Circumvents authoritarianism by holding Executive accountable; powers are not concentrated in onemind. Unnecessary interference of Legislators in administrative matter causing inefficiency of both Executive and Legislative. Diversity of parties – educative value – public builds opinions based on different party manifestos. Vote Bank Politics as a result of competition between various parties results in a Government that tends to be ElectionCentric. Easy availability of an alternate government shows the flexibility of this system. Relying on majority party, experts in the field are not hired for inputs on executive duties. Ministers may be underqualified, making them dependent on civil servants hence creating a ‘bureaucratic government’. MERITS & DEMERITS OF PARLIAMENTARY FORM FORMS OF GOVERNMENT FEATURES Parliamentary Presidential Executive Dual Executive Single Executive Relationship b/w Executive and Legislative Executive is accountable to the Legislative as it comes from the latter. Both are independent and Executive is not accountable. Tenure Unfixed Fixed Dissolution Prime Minister may dissolve the LowerHouse before expiration of term. President cannotdissolve the Lower House. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: PRESIDENTIAL & PARLIAMENTARY FORMS FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ▪ By definition, a cabinet is a body of high-ranking State officials – like leaders of executive branch. ▪ Functions of Cabinet may vary between decision making bodies with collective responsibility and purely advisory bodies that are assistant to Head of State/Government. ▪ The term used for Cabinet differs across countries. The Cabinet is known by names such as \"Council of Ministers\", \"Government Council\" or \"Council of State\",or by lesser known names such as \"Federal Council\" etc. CABINET FORMS OF GOVERNMENT PRESID ENTIAL SYSTEM PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM Collectively decides the government's direction, usually in regard to legislations passed by the parliament. Official role of Cabinet is that of official advisory council to the head of Government – President receives advice andopinions. Monarch/Ceremonial Head of State virtually always acts on advice of Cabinet. President can depart from Cabinet’s advice as seen fit by him. On ground, the Cabinet reports to real Head of Government – usually the Prime Minister – rather than the titular Head of State. Cabinet works directly under and for the President who is both Head of Government and State. The Cabinet in a parliamentary system must not only be confirmed, but enjoy the continuing confidence of theParliament. Members of the Cabinet are chosen directly by President, they may or may not have to be confirmed by Legislation. Cabinet influences Legislative policy to a large extent. Members of Cabinet focus on and have massive influence in their own Executive departments. ROLE OF CABINET FORMS OF GOVERNMENT In conclusion, a Cabinet is found in almost all forms of Government, the two major ones – Presidential, Parliamentary – and other hybrid versions such as semi- Presidential system etc. The members are responsible for daily management of the Government, response to emergency situations and sudden events. They play an important role in any form of Governance and help to keep things running smoothly. FORMS OF GOVERNMENT THANK YOU","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
