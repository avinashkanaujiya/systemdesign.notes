A design ==pattern== for writing API.

Main focus is to have server work in a ==stateless== manner.

It only exposes data, which can be manipulated by replacing it with newer version of that data.

It exposes a entity model, that only exist in concept and may or maynot exist on either side of the service.

You can compare it with [[RPC]].

Some major implementation are - [[HTTP (REST implementation, protocol)|HTTP]] & [[URI]].
