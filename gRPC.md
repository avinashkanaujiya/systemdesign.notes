## Highlights

REST

A signature characteristic of this style of API is that clients do not construct URLs from other informationâ€”they just use the URLs that are passed out by the server as-is.

The only parsing of a URL that a browser does is to extract the information required to send an HTTP request, and the only construction of URLs that a browser does is to form an absolute URL from relative and base URLs.

gRPC

The way a client uses a gRPC API is by following these three steps:

1.  Decide which procedure to call
    
2.  Calculate the parameter values to use (if any)
    
3.  Use a code-generated stub to make the call, passing the parameter values

Note: A code module is installed and used to connect with the service, as opposed to using URL.
e.g openai, firebase
